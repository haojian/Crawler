Serious Chinese food only! the wait is horrendous! but.... as good things come to those who wait for 1 and an half! the Food was delicious! My favorite is, FRIED TOFU, and THE FAMOUS LOBSTER! the lobster is pricey about $10+ per pound but is a culinary delicacy! and watch out for Chinese people in the parking lot, I witnessed a Chinese couple hit-n-run a motorcycle parked their.

From all the great Yelp reviews, we definitely had this restaurant in mind. Parking wasn't too great and the line...well a good suggestion is to come earlier than 6 pm. The restaurant looks pretty modernized and chic. The menu had one too many dishes to choose from, but these are the following dishes that I ordered: 1. Crab meat with fish maw soup-Allergic, but I was told that it was delicious and had a lot of crab in it. 2. Kung pao chicken-Better than the one in Rowland Heights. The chicken was tender and a little bit crispy. I actually loved this dish even though it's so Americanized for me... 3. Shrimp with walnuts-Not a fan because it has mayo; however, everyone loved it, since the dish was empty. 4. Vegetables (don't know what it is called)-These were thin and it looked dry, but it didn't have any flavor...So if you check out the picture, than I would suggest not to order this dish. 5. Big pea sprouts-Better than little pea sprouts! The vegetable was sweet and refreshing. The flavor was just right as well. I would recommend this dish! 6. Sauteed tofu with vegetables-Avoid this dish...it was soooo soggy and limp. 7. Chicken fried egg noodles-As adventurous as myself, I had to go out of my comfort zone and got chicken instead of beef. Bad mistake. Tasted funny, the chicken was a little bit salty and dry since it was breast meat. The fried egg noodles was ok, not the best maybe because it wasn't with beef sauce instead. 8. French style filet mignon cubes-Loved it! So tender and juicy. This dish is a must! The onions go so well with the beef! 9. House special lobster-Of course, what they are known for! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to eat this at this certain day, but it was devoured within twenty minutes. So I think it was that great! Service here was good as well. The waiters had a sense of humor and they were pretty attentive. I would recommend coming to this location rather than Rowland Heights. However, I think that the lobster tastes the same at both locations. Just the other dishes are better here.

To be honest, I would give this place five stars if I could, but the rating for cleanness is 蔭 C. Which, makes me kind of iffy. No one wants cockroaches and moss growing in the kitchen. OKAY SORRY TO GROSS YOU GUYS OUT. It's not that bad. The food totally makes up for the rating though---it's scrumptious! SERVICE I mean, the place is really crowded all the time and the servers are really busy. But otherwise, you got some nice Chinese men serving you. They come by your table fast, so if you need a waiter, get one pronto. AMBIANCE It's large and loud. It's cause there are so many people and everyone's talking at once. Not the right place for a romantic, quiet dinner, but definitely one for a rowdy family dinner. WHAT I EAT -Steamed Crab W/ Garlic My favorite! Absolutely my favorite! Especially when you order a rather large crab and the shell is cut open so that all the meat is lying out....So good. Even better when paired with XO sauce, so don't forget to ask for some! -House Special Lobster I'm not a big lobster fan, so this was a meh for me. But my entire family loves it and we always get it when guests come, so it's all good. Good portions with lots of lobster egg. -Thai-Style Seafood Soup It's Thai style and it's good. Tong Yang Soup anyone? It's a bit spicy, so all y'all people who don't like spicy, this is not for you. -French Style Beef I love meat and I love this. I like it because it's tender to the point where you know that no one added in any baking soda to make the meat tender. It's a good, real meat tender. I also love that there's pepper on it which gives it a nice flavor. -Taro Boba Best taro boba ever. The boba is okay, but the taro is amazing. Most places, it's watery and colored purple, but here, it's texturized correctly and it's like a slushie. So good. A must get! CONCLUSION It's pricey and the line is always super long, but it's definitely worth it. A good Chinese restaurant and a good seafood place. The parking is hard to find and it's always crowded (and the sanitary issue) are the only problems I have. Otherwise, please do try!

My first time coming here I really didn't know what to expect. I had never heard of this place, I've never seen it, I didn't know it existed. So as we arrived to the place, there was a long ass line which surprised me. This gave me time to check this place out on Yelp and the great reviews really got me excited. Yes, this place IS expensive. However, you are really paying for good food here. This is probably one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever tried (I have tried tons and I'm Chinese). We ordered: House Special Lobster: Definitely worth the hype. Lobster is obviously fresh. They take it out of the tank and cook it right there for you. It tastes delicious. Lobster is really sweet and perfectly cooked. Beef Loc Lac: Really tender meet cooked to perfect. Perfect amount of seasoning. The meat is so soft and tender is melts in your mouth. Walnut Shrimp: Nice big pieces of shrimp accompanied with candied walnuts. Not too much mayo mixed in it so it is not too heavy. Some kinda fish: Not sure what fish we ordered, but it was steamed. Really flaky and nicely cooked. Overall, great meal. NO complaints regarding the food. Everything was great and service was good. If you are coming on weekends or with a big party, make reservations. This place does get crowded and parking could be hard to find since their lot is limited. Oh yeah, oranges for dessert!

If you don't come here for Lobster or Crab I don't know why you could come here. Thought I could just come in for a quick lunch and it ended up being an hour wait just for two. Had to satisfy my craving for the House special Lobster. 蔋ad a 5lb lobster for two people. Thought is was going to be plenty but it was just good enough. The friend oyster were very tasty. The clams were ok, nothing special. Just to make myself feel better I decided to order some vegetables. They only have a limited amount of veggies on the menu so I suggest sticking with the basics. Morning glory and Gai Lan with oyster sauce. This location is definitely a lot cleaner and spacious than the one in Santa Ana. I am coming here from now on.

Awesome Chinese seafood. Fresh, flavorful, and delicious! The must order here is definitely their Newport Lobster.. so delicious with large chunks of lobster meat!! They cut the lobster for you so that the meat is easy to get to. We also ordered a steamed fish, gai lan (2), and rice noodle dish. All were excellent. I love how fresh the steam fish was .... better than the wedding banquet type. =P It still looks like Marie Callenders from the outside, but looks world's away inside. They did a really good job with the interior decorating. This is a place where you can take your date's parents and impress them. ;)

This is one of those "Traditional" family style Chinese restaurants. It's rated the BEST Chinese restaurant in San Gabriel. The parking lot is truly terrible, and chaotic. Whenever I come with the family, I would just avoid the parking lot altogether and just park across the street (next to carls jr). The wait is also VERY long. Be prepared for it, unless you camp out before they open The food here is pretty good. I'm a huge fan of the House Special Lobster, and the Kung Pao Chicken. Price wise. I think it's pretty reasonable for the area. It's about $5-$10 a plate (not counting the more exotic stuff). The food here is definitely ALOT cheaper during lunch. The service here is great, especially for a Chinese restaurant. Everyone seems to always have a smile. Overall, great restaurant, decent prices.

The best crab place I've tried in the United States that is still open (the best one IMO is Crab Zone in Laguna Beach, but they closed). This place is known for their finger-licking crustacean (crab and lobster) dishes, so you have to come off-peak if you don't want to wait a long time. But even if there's a lot of people ahead of me, I still wait for the chance to eat one of their superb dishes. They can cook your crab in multiple ways, and they're all good, but I liked the Newport Special crab best. Grab friends who are fanatical crab eaters, so you can order different dishes. Ask for the crab dishes to be served in different plates to make sure a crab leg or two aren't missing. Their seafood tofu soup was quite good, too. It isn't your standard Chinese "hai-sien tofu tang." Lots of umami. I know it's a crime to order steak in a seafood place, but their shaking beef (they call it by its Vietnamese name, beef luc lac) is tender and flavorful. Among the best I've had anywhere. Fantastic with rice.

This place was good. 蔠e loved how the waiter stopped us from ordering some things and told us exactly what to order. He didn't recommend the lobster though and later found out that that was the most popular dish. =( Instead we ordered the salt and pepper crab which was also very delicious. I really enjoyed the pea sprouts and the fried rice. 蔜he soup was just OKAY... 蕋hat was probably my least favorite but it was still refreshing and clean. I love to eat good authentic Chinese food and I would definitely come back for more. I can't wait to come back and try the spicy garlic lobster. P.S. I don't know why they got a C but the restaurant seemed pretty clean, but who knows what really goes on back there. No wonder it's so good......

I've come here for lunch a bunch of times and dinner once. And that's because it gets so packed during the evening. 蔍t's warranted, because the food is fantastically awesome. �The lunch specials are priced very very modestly. 蔙anging between $5.75-$6.25, you'll be able to sample and fill your stomach with a wide range of their specialities. 蔔ote: Lobster will never be on this menu. �My absolute favourite thing on the lunch menu is the Clam with Basil Sauce.

Came by for dinner the other night. A "10 minute" wait for a table became 30. The interior of the restaurant was really nice. The LA Department of Health does rate the restaurant as a "C"... The "Small" House Special Lobster was "4 ish pounds" at $16/lb. We were charged for 5 lbs. The House Special Sauce was bland as it merely covered the lobster. The Lobster was either too big or overcooked...no good. The Beef Loc Lac was also mediocre. The meat was slightly on the coarse side. The sauce was too salty. The Fried Tofu was bland. At ~$10, it definitely wasn't worth it. Nothing special. The large garlic pea sprouts were expensive at $16. Again, nothing special. The dish was oily... Service was okay by the staff. The highlight of the meal was the huge plate of oranges for dessert. ...the restaurant was also really hot sitting by the window...

The most memorable part about my visit here was the end. After the meal was finished, bill was paid, we left the restaurant and notice they had a C rating strategically hidden behind the tree or plant they have in front. Talk about leaving a bad taste in your mouth huh? As Mr.626 felt like I was way over due for not trying this place earlier. But I'm glad I fought the urge and all this hype. You know what? It was all right. Wasn't bad, wasn't amazing either. It's just like any other traditional restaurant in the SGV/626, except they got those GIANT crabs and lobsters. Not gonna lie, those things are HUGE!!! I think the chinese way of enjoying this type of seafood is kinda over done. You really CANNOT taste the freshness of the seafood. It's all masked by all the ginger and garlic they use in the stir frying process. Don't get me wrong, it is delicious! But yeah, other than that, there is really nothing special about this place. One thing I gotta add though. The "medium" serving of lobster was like $90. Our entire meal was like $140. Party of 6 people. Wonder how much it would be if we got the large order. Just sayin'

Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant is a family favorite, so naturally we came here after Allys's graduation. They don't take reservations, but if you call in advance and let them know you're on the way to the restaurant, they will jot down your name and give you a number in line. Service here is one of the best for old school Asian dining. The servers speak Chinese, Vietnamese, and English. They're always helpful and good about switching out dirty dishes, refilling drinks, and getting food out quickly. Prices are extremely reasonable if you're not ordering lobster or Alaskan King Crab. They also have family meal sets - great for large parties and is an awesome value! Lunch prices here are ridiculously cheap and portions are large. Favorite dishes from this weekend: Catfish Hot & Sour Soup (Better than my mama's shhh..) Clam with Black Bean Sauce (Sydney's favorite) Kung Pao Beef (My favorite lunch item) Misc Veggie (Yummmms!) Newport Special Lobster (Pricey, but very delicious with all the peppers and lobster roe) Crispy Fried Sole Fish (Perfectly cooked and easy to eat without worrying you'll swallow a bone) Fried Calamari (Allys's favorite) Jimmy couldn't stop complimenting the food and service!

I am attempting to review all the yummy Asian restaurants I grew up enjoying, because I don't live here anymore and all my family members have moved back to Taiwan. 蔋opefully this will help me remember all the places I loved to eat at and perhaps will one day come back to frequent, family-style. This place is great for large family-style dinners. Most delicious calamari I've ever had in this preparation. Not much else I can say except really good seafood. 蔍've also never had an allergic reaction here, which is more than I can say for 90% of Asian seafood restaurants (though this does not necessarily affect the deliciousness or my enjoyment of the food).

Still stellar. 蔉orget any restaurant you've been to in Socal for lobster. �For that matter, 蕋he best lobster I've had ever in the states is here. 蔍t's slightly peppery with sauteed mild chiles, butter, garlic, tamale, green onions...the ingredients sound like a melange of disparate ingredients but they all work together to surprise your palate. 蔜he novelty to this recipe is, on your first bite you instantly recognize you've had this dish before but is so different yet familiar and tasty. �蔜his combination of ingredients is genius because it highlights the sweetness and briny freshness 蕂f lobster meat. �It's truly amazing and at $15 per pound, it's the cheapest value for amazingly unique 蔿obster you cannot get anywhere in the immediate 2,000 mile radius. 蔍 have not had lobster cooked so expertly and deliciously like this outside of France. 蔍've had this lobster many times and don't tire of it. ��I've never been to Cambodia or Vietnam from where this cooking tradition emerges and I am going very soon. Had the French Beef �cubed filet, small cubes) as well and it came beautifully sauteed in butter and spices, Vietnamese salt and lime on the side and raw onions. 蔍'm sooo not into raw onions on anything but a little onion with this perfectly flavored beef mignon, a little salt, a drop of lime juice and the resulting combination is truly deeeeelishush. �This dish is poetry.....well so is the lobster!!! The Sauteed Pea Sprouts in browned garlic and fish sauce �loads of brown garlic) brings me back to dining in SE Asia. �I can eat a huge mound of this everyday. I'm giving the food 5++++ stars but the service, 4.5. 蔜here is a waiter that serves the smaller rooms who does not pay attention and does not practice good customer service. 蔄void the semi-private rooms. 蔈at in the main dining room and you'll have an amazing time. Tip: 蔜here's always a line here. 蔕n weekends 蔰uring lunch until 3PM, when most of the menu goes on SALE, the wait can be upwards of 45 minutes. 蔍 love this place!! �One of my favorite restaurants, in the U.S. Visits: 50+

I agree with everyone, the lobster is pretty tasty with all that spice and flavoring! The pricing of the lobster goes by pounds, and when my bf and I asked for the smallest one, it was still 3-4 pounds.. so it gets pretty expensive for the dish. But if you're coming with other people, then it's a great dish to split! We were so full from the lobster that we barely touched the beef cubes.. so we got that to go. Solid Chinese restaurant though! You should give it a try! :)

Two of us ordered small size of Newport Special Lobster, Walnut Shrimps, lightly saut巈d vegetables (don't remember the name) and Fresh lemon sodas. Every single menu was fantastic along with complimentary hot tea and oranges for dessert. Several take out boxes were necessary after working hard to fill up my stomach.

I came here with a few classmates to celebrate the last day of our quarter + finals. We have previously ventured out to this place before and loved it! Beef luc lac: Definitely the BEST of all the placed that I've had it before. So juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked! It comes with a side of lemon + salt & pepper condiment for dipping, but the meat tastes BOMB on it's own. Sauteed Pea Sprouts: I love this! It so refreshing and light to eat. I can eat it for daaaayyys. Salt & Pepper Shrimp: Soooooo good. Crunchy on the outside with the perfect touch of salt and pepper. Unfortunately, I can only eat a few at a time. Combination Stirred Fried Flat Rice Noodles: I love noodles and I appreciate that it wasn't too greasy and had the perfect balance of noodles and meat! At the end of the meal, they give you the sweeeetest oranges to eat. The staff is always welcoming and so, so nice! My friend told me that the owners are Chinese, Cambodian, & Vietnamese, which gives them an A+ in my book. BEST Chinese restaurant in LA... I'm even salivating while writing this review. That's how amazing it is ;D I hope to come back and try the crab!

Had an early dinner here Saturday with friends to celebrate a birthday.... Well, trying to have an early dinner, at least. The line to eat at this restaurant was crazy. It was my first time there & even seeing the place so I didn't know what to expect. But as soon as I pulled into the parking lot, I was like WHOA... There's a ton of people sitting/standing outside waiting to get in & it wasn't even 7pm yet... We waited about an hour to be seated for our table of 9. All good. It was worth it... They even seated us at one of the semi-private rooms. Our group opted for the 8 item $118 dinner which included: hot & sour cat fish soup (good spicy & sour tasting broth), salt & pepper crab & shrimp (very good), clams in a spicy sauce (just ok to me), french style beef (tender, good), kong pao chicken (very good, loved it), peking style pork chop (good taste), sauteed peasprout (not bad), steamed whole fish (2 tilapias in a very tasty brown broth)... We also added the house whole special lobster in garlic sauce. CRACK!... I rarely get to eat lobster so i was really looking forward to this. It was very good. Good sized lobster which all 9 of us had a crack at... YUM. We also had some pan fried chow mein with seafood & veggies. Pretty standard. I was satisfied with it. I liked this place... I'd recommend it. Prepare for a very long wait at prime time dining hours. But to me it was worth it... I saw an Alaskan king crab for the first time. A damn BIG one... Straight of the fishing vessel Cornelia Marie from the show Deadliest Catch. HAHAHA. Awesome.. Felt like such a tourist but I had to snap a pic or two of it. The waiter told us it was $38 per lb and they averaged 8-12 lbs... DAMN. Obviously, we opted to go another direction for dinner. HAHA.... Next time, perhaps? corkage fee: $15

Ordered the lobster with ginger scallion, and requested a smaller sized lobster for a party of two. 蔜he waiter tells us the smallest they have is 4-5 lbs. 蔋ard to believe, but went ahead with it. 蔜he lobster turned out to be a 5.5 lb monster. 蔍t was delicious, totally decadent with bits of lobster roe scattered about the plate. 蔛auce is the key component - anything smothered in that sauce would taste good. � stars for that. Also ordered the Pea Sprouts and the Walnut Shrimp. 蔖ea sprouts were light and tasty, but extremely fibrous. 蔍 found myself chewing forever. 蔜he Walnut Shrimp... I couldn't believe how bad it was. 蔍t was totally smothered, killed in mayonnaise, and wrapped with the thickest batter - almost like a shrimp mayo donut. 蔍've had better at the most ghetto take out joints in Brooklyn, the kind with bullet proof glass protecting the cashier.

I come here pretty often for family dinners. I think it's pretty expensive but worth it given the quality of the food. There's ALWAYS a wait. It's crazy how many people are always lining up here, even on weekdays. There's even a line before it opens. It used to be smaller and not as fancy farther down on Las Tunas. I really like the new location and has pretty nice decor. All of the food here is pretty good. My favorites are the lobster, chilled elephant clam (FAVORITE), and the diced beef (I'm not sure what the real name is). Be prepared to spend money. You won't be disappointed though! I think they have lunch specials too.

Brought my dad here for Father's Day and he loved everything about this place. What I ordered: 8lbs Newport Special Lobster- perfect! though I'll admit, it's pretty messy to eat. Beef Loc Lac (French Style)- AHHH sooooo damn good! Really tender beef, super juicy, and perfectly flavored. I will come back just for this dish because it really can't be lob$$ter day every time... haha Shrimp Fried Rice- really good and generous amounts of shrimp to make me happy. :) Sauteed Pea Sprouts- a great vegetable side and cooked al dente. :) Chinese Broccoli with Oyster sauce- what you would expect. Overall this place was reasonably priced and officially my favorite lobster restaurant in LA. Service is kinda funky because we werent assigned a specific server, but overall worth every dollar I spent! I can't wait to go back for that beef though. haha

This has been a old family favorite place so I dont know why I have not written a Yelp review. Maybe it was having it to celebrate my dad's milestone birthday but a review is a long time coming. I'll make it plain - THIS IS THE BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT IN LA. Period. Order whatever and it will be good. I know the reviews talk about the lobster but since the restaurant was located at a hole in the wall on Las Tunas and Mission my family has been getting the crab in black bean sauce.

I wasn't that impressed by this place but it's probably because I didn't order lobster. We went for lunch so they had the lunch specials which were such a deal! Only $6-7 for each dish. The sizes for the lunch specials are definitely smaller than what you would get during dinner though. I was looking at their dinner menu and everything was really pricey. Overall the food was good, service was good, and the taste was pretty good. The restaurant also gave me comfort that it was clean. The wait is too long though if you don't have a reservation (especially you have a large party). If I come back next time, I must try their lobster since that's what everyone talks about.

I. Die. Came here to spend time with family, and plan the cousin's baby shower... and to EAT, of course. Boy, did I eat! Ate so much, I thought I would burst. Not good, I know, but I really couldn't help it, the food was so good! There were 9 of us, in total. We got there right at opening (11:30) and were seated right away in one of the private rooms. My cousins are very familiar with with the menu and knew right away what they wanted to order, which we ate family style. Service was fast, and extremely efficient. We came very hungry and left ridiculously satisfied. Here's a breakdown of what we got: Fish with Basil ~ my favorite dish. Loved it so much I'm craving it again, just thinking about it. Seriously? I'm thinking of going back just to order some for lunch! Beef Luc Lac ~ another great dish! Beef was tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned! Kung Pao Chicken ~ pretty basic, but still yummy! Shrimp With Walnut ~ the shrimp was so crispy and delicious sweet and savory! Sauteed Peasprout ~ who can't use a little veg in their lives? Seriously though? They are tender garlic-y goodness. Rice Noodles with Shrimp ~ Mmmmm... Fried Tofu ~ I LOVE fried tofu!!! On paper, it doesn't seem like enough food to feed 9 people, but it was... and we had enough for leftovers! Naturally, once the food came, all talk of baby shower plans fell by the wayside. So we resumed talks after we finished our meal. An added +++ for the restaurant? The servers/managers didn't say boo about us taking up the table for an hour (after we had finished eating) while we discussed our plans. Even though it was their lunch rush! LOVE this place!!! Definitely coming back!

Efficient. Seating for 12, 25 minute wait. Just got back now. Fast service. Got the set meal for 9-10people ($238). Lobster and crab exquisite. Fried and salted beef, chicken, shrimp excellent. Kung pao pork spareribs good, but hard to eat given goopiness + bones Fried rice great and overflowing with meat Veggies (chinese brocoli and mushrooms) complements the meat dishes well Steamed fish was great. Haven't written a review in a long time, yet felt compelled to add to the 1000 others already here. That probably means something. When I come back to LA, I will be back here.

We waited over an hour in line for two people and it was worth it. It's as clean and efficiently run a Chinese restaurant as you can get. We ordered the small pea shoots, beef luc lac, black bean clams, and honey walnut shrimp. Everything was reasonably priced and came in large portions. The beef luc lac was tender, black bean clams were fresh and sweet, and the honey walnut shrimp weren't coated in a thick shell of batter and mayo. Surprisingly, everything wasn't overly greasy or salty either. Credit cards accepted, parking in front.

Fabulous Asian Seafood restaurant that is the best location out of it's various counterparts. 蔛tarted as a family run business in Santa Ana until they branched out and opened the original Las Tunas location. 蔜hey have since sold their interests in the original Santa Ana location even though it is still called Tan Cang Newport who even today on their web page denounces any fealty to Newport Tan Cang. 蔔TC has moved to their present location; 蔭 large, clean. well appointed location that was at one time a Marie Callendars, although they do have another location in Rowland Heights called Newport Seafood Restaurant; 蕂k, got all of that? 蔜his one is the best of the bunch -- its newer, bigger, cleaner, and the parking is better... It's always better to come to a place like this with a group of people so that you can order several dishes and share family style. 蔠ith the four of us we chose to go with one of the family meal prix fixe menus for $48 to start with and augmented it with two more dishes to make seven dishes altogether including a soup course... The $48 family meal menu included the following: We chose to have the House Seafood soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_� 蔍t was a hearty soup that had shrimp, squid, and fish balls to go along with the napa, snow peas, and water chestnuts, along with some pork meat based broth; 蔰efinitely more Cantonese style and gentle in taste without any spicy heat... Clam w/Spicy Hot Sauce had sliced green chiles for heat along with Thai basil and garlic for flavor with a stir fried dish of Manila Clams... http://www.yelp.com/biz_�Stir fried Kong Pao Chicken (or beef if we wanted) was pretty standard, it was good but otherwise unremarkable http://www.yelp.com/biz_� 蔜he red chiles supplied the heat while the peanuts provided salty crunch, and diced scallions rounded out the dish which had a thick sauce just enough to coat... We could have had Sauteed Peasprouts, but chose to have Chinese Broccoli stir fried in garlic instead http://www.yelp.com/biz_� 蔍 liked the fact that we got a lot of the dark leafy parts instead of just a bunch of stalks for a change... A relatively small Steamed Whole Fish, perhaps it was bass, I'm not too sure, was prepared the classic way with ginger and scallions, steamed and then finished with hot oil and soy http://www.yelp.com/biz_� 蔜he flesh was sweet and succulent, this dish is a delicacy that I really enjoy... To these five items we ordered two more of their more popular dishes a la carte: French style Beef Loc Lac ($12.95) was tender cubed beef gently stir fried in a sweet sauce that coated the beef http://www.yelp.com/biz_� 蔄 very delicious and savory dish, this is almost a must order... When you come to NCT, you have to order one of the house specials, either the crab or the lobster (seasonal price per lb.) 蔉or one thing, they have some of the biggest catches that you will find in LA. 蔜he King Crab that I saw swimming in the tank by the front door had a body that was the size of a catchers mitt with a leg span that could have been 30 inches across, it was amazing http://www.yelp.com/biz_� 蔠e had the Lobster w/Ginger and Green Onions, a 4-5 lb monster, and at market price it was more than the rest of our meal combined http://www.yelp.com/biz_� 蔜he real story behind the lobster though is that NCT really likes to push their lobster or crab; 蕎e asked for a smaller lobster since we already had so much food already, only to have our jaws drop when they brought out a huge, nearly 5 lb. lobster. 蔠hen we asked the waiter about it, he explained politely that he told the chef that we wanted a smaller one for about 4 people, but that the chef just selected this one and rationalized that this was one of the smaller ones. 蔎udging by what was being served that evening on the floor ours was indeed one of the smaller ones but freakishly large by any other standard. 蔎ust be prepared to pay upwards of around $80 like we did for it... We rolled out of there with much of our meal brown bagged, I think we had enough food for 6 or 8. 蔜he service was very good all evening, a pleasant departure from the typical service that you would expect from some Chinese restaurants... If I were to have a special occasion, NCT would be near the top of my list, the only thing they don't have is Peking Duck...

I made plans to meet a friend for dinner and I asked him to pick his favorite restaurant. He picked Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant. 蔍t was so delicious, I only wish we had more people at the table so we could have ordered more dishes to try. The restaurant has a great ambiance and feel and service couldn't be any faster. 蔠e had sweet and sour soup with shrimp, fish with basil and shrimp with walnut. 蔍 recommend them all. 蔒y favorite of the three: 蕋he Fish with Basil. We met there around 5:30 PM on a Saturday night and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, got lucky with a booth by the window. 蔅y the time we left though, the waiting area was packed. Even though I didn't have the lobster, most others did and it looked amazing. 蔍'll be back!

This is my favorite traditional Chinese restaurant. Every single one of my family members love this place. My family often order the lobster of pick-up when we have family potlucks and gatherings. But a couple things to be aware of.. 1) Don't even bother entering the parking lot here if you come for dinner. You're better off less frustrated parking on the street across the street from the restaurant. AND don't even think about jaywalking. I've seen many cops camp out around just waiting for those people. 2) Expect an hour wait at the least. They're really popular and though the restaurant is of pretty decent size, the wait is almost always guaranteed. 3) It's not that cheap. compared to other restaurants of like, this isn't the cheapest, but I do think it's the best in regards to taste. 4) Ask the owner if your party can sit in a big table is you have only 4 people or less. Often times, when you have a small party and they have only big tables, they still don't seat you. But, if you ask the owner and there are no big parties on the waiting list, she'll let you sit in the big tables. 5) The server speaks English. Lucky for you all, this is one of the few Chinese restaurants where the servers speak fluent English. Hope this helps! And, happy eating. :)

FRESHEST SEAFOOD you'll get from any restaurant. I decided to try something new because Phoenix has changed since I've last been there. The quality of their food SUCKS now. So, with the 2 of us, we ordered 5lbs lobster in house special sauce, which was TO DIE FOR!!!! 蔈ven thought it's oily, greasy, and bad for you like any other Chinese restaurant, the freshness, and sweetness of the lobster makes up for that. We also got their claim in spicy house sauce, which was THE BEST I ever had. The clam was plump, juicy, fresh, and absolutely delicious. Unlike some other restaurants, the clams are small, and sandy.... this one is not like that. I know, I know, there's only 2 of us, but we also decided to order their salt and pepper fried calramari, which my bf decided to eat the whole plate by himself. So, I guess that speaks for itself on how good the calamari is. On to the last dish, we ordered on choy with garlic, which was fresh! The vegetables were green, and not brown like some restaurants. �Based on the review, you know you gotta try it because it's not just a hype, it's really that good! 蔍 think I would a new must go restaurant in San Gabriel now..... when I feel like driving from Irvine to SG.

WHY write another review after over 1,000 are posted? 蔅ECAUSE we "yelpers" are a community and each review helps all of us. 蔔ewport REALLY is "as good as it gets." Here's why: 1) From the moment the four of us walked in ... each employee who saw us smiled and said something nice. 蔠e felt that they were actually pleased we were there. 蔕ur waiter was outstanding. 蔋is suggestions were excellent and he explained why he recommeded each dish. 2) Fortunately, we arrived early ... about 5:30 pm on a Sunday ... following a play in Hollywood. 蔜his restaurant fills up early. 蔠hen we left at 6:30 pm, it was full ... and ... people, mostly families, were waiting inside and outside. 3) 蔜he restaurant is famous for crab and lobster. 蔠e choose other items because we didn't want to work hard at cracking to get to the "good stuff." 蔠e had hot and sour soup, a crispy shrimp with a white, slightly sweet sauce, Beef Loc Lac (French Style) made with fillet mignon ("out of this world" good,) fried rice, fish and wonderfully sweet orange slices for dessert. 4) Would I go back? �In a heart beat!!" 蔜he best Chinese food I've had the world over, excepting one meal in China!

I haven't been here since my celebratory college graduation meal in 2005 which was VERY apparent by the fact I didn't even realize this place moved! Luckily, as I was driving by, the rounded sign caught my eye. Anyhow, it's still on Las Tunas so it hasn't moved very far from its previous location within the cramped Golden Deli plaza. For some reason I can no longer recall, I decided I didn't like this place and my family has not since returned. Recently, this place came up in conversation & I told someone I would give it another try. When I arrived at 9pm, the parking lot was already full (watch out for double parking) and there was already a long wait. Already hungry from the 626 Night Market debacle, I told my stomach to hold tight since my table wouldn't be seated for another 45 minutes. More than an hour later, I put in my order right before they closed the kitchen. Since a lot of people take numbers and decide not to wait, it's hard for the host to gauge wait times. The place was empty so I opted for a booth versus one of those giant banquet style tables with the lazy susans. I was thoroughly impressed by the booth's decor. There were even pillows! �I kept it simple and ordered House Lobster and Sauteed Peasprouts. I wasn't deterred by the fact that we were literally the last ones in the restaurant. I just kept right on eating. My friend & I devoured every meaty morsel of our tasty crustacean. They kept trying to change out my plate and I had to accept I couldn't add anything else to my tower of shells. I was pretty full just on lobster but next time I'd order the Vietnamese dish, bo luc lac, or French-style cubed filet mignon. Like a lot of Asian places, your check comes with complimentary oranges. It's a pretty pricey meal so of course they have to take credit card (Visa and Mastercard) but they do not take American Express. ��Next to the entrance, you can catch a glimpse of the myriad tanks filled with various types of seafood: shrimp, crab, lobster, geoduck (known on the menu as elephant clam), and monstrously large spider crab. On this night, all of the fish in the tank looked dead so we decided to simply stick to the lobster. Make sure you take a gander to make sure whatever you order is alive and kicking (or pinching).

Yay, Randy the Rooster here and took a China doll here for a first date. I ordered the house special lobster and steamed fish. Both were fantastic. The steamed rockcod actually had the best sauce I've ever had, and I've tried this same sweet soy-based sauce at many other Hong Kong style seafood places. Knocked a star off for the ridiculous weighting of the seafood and the fact you pay for rice. I wanted a small rock cod and got one. Somehow it ended weighing 3.75 pounds. The lobster was also 3.75 pounds. Every time I've been there the seafood weighs ed zachary x.75 pounds!?? (The waiter actually said, "Yes, the seafood is ed zachary 3.75 pounds".) I would also advise you to ask how much the vegetables are. The waiter tried hard to upsell yam leaves which were $15! The regular vegetables like chinese broccoli and pea leaves are $10. I would say the place is overpriced and the nickel and diming with the upselling and charging for rice are things to watch out for. Oh, if you want a hot Oriental gold digger, stick around this place. Never saw so much Gucci and Prada in my life!

Yes, yes everyone comes here for the $16/LB lobster (average order is 5-6 lbs). 蔍t is really good; however, all the other dishes are very mediocre. �I don't really understand why people complain about how expensive the lobster is when it's approximately the same price at nearby restaurants like NBC, Capital Seafood, Sea Habour, and Mission 261, but none of them are nearly as good. 蔛o, if you're going to pay that much for lobster, why not get the best? �The portion is also huge. 蔛o, go easy on the other items (that aren't even that good)!

Darn good seafood in the SGV. Love the house lobster. So delicious and I had leftovers for days. It was seasoned nicely and cooked well. We got a small lobster but it was still really big. Came out to approx $60 Got the Elephant Clam/Geoduck sashimi cooked two ways. You can choose how you want it cooked. We got the end further from the shell sliced. It was arranged nicely and laid on top of ice. We opted for the deep fry. They used the end close to the shell to deep fry since its less firm. Super yummy with wasabi. Really steep. Forked out $100 something for that. I also got the fish maw soup which was always really good. Overall, the food is great here, the service is also really good. Definitely a good place for a good meal with friends.

(Dined 6/24/12 SU @ 4:30pm): Based on the service alone, I vow to return again and again. My family and I had just watched a friend in a dance performance of the beloved children's book, "Pippi Longstocking", put on by the Vonder Haar Center for the Performing Arts, at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse, and we seriously needed someplace to eat. So, thanks to my handy-dandy Yelp app, Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant was among the top of the list and was barely a mile away. I had my parents with me in my Brave Little Toaster, and my sister had my nieces with her, so we caravaned with me in the lead, and in about five minutes, we had arrived. I parked in the private lot and my sister on the street (which later proved to be a better decision; it was tremendously busy by the time we left, and a parking lot filled with driving Asians is never a good thing). Our party of six was immediately seated at a rotund table fit for ten towards the back near the dishes area. As we sat down, a server placed what apparently was complimentary spicy hot soup for each of us. Then, another gentleman handed us a couple tabloid-sized printed menus and told us that we have five minutes to still order off the lunch menu before it switches to dinner. Initially, we were all confused because we figured it was already dinner time. The lunch menu ended at 4:45pm, at which time the dinner prices were considerably higher. Being Filipino, we couldn't pass up this opportunity to save some money, so in less than three minutes, we decided what to order (this had to be a record for anyone eating at a new place!): Beef Mongolian Style ($6.25), Pan Fried Pork Chop ($6.25), Shrimp with Chinese Broccoli ($6.75), Fillet Fish with Basil ($7.25), Deep Fried Whole Fish ($7.25), Rice Noodles with Beef ($7.25), and complimentary rice and tea. Before we knew it, like a great magician, poof, all our food came out carried by three servers! What the fuck was going on here!? Did they happen to have all of these dishes already prepared!? Did we get pulled into some weird warp-speed plane where only we moved in regular motion!? Or was there some kind of ancient Chinese secret going on we've never experienced before!? Whatever is was, we were all ravenous, and dove in as we spinned the lazy Susan nearly out of control. I looked over to Dad and he already had a full plate and was chomping away! Maybe because we were starving, but a general comment made by all: "this food is REALLY good!!!" No truer words have ever been said. Everything came out piping hot in bountiful portions, and it was obvious all ingredients were fresh. Several of the dishes were spicy...just the way I liked it! With the exception of the deep fried whole fish plate (and it was only the skeletal bones which remained), each plate looked like they were licked clean (okay, maybe merely scraped clean...that was me)! It was all THAT GOOD! The service was excellent! The gentleman who told us about the lunch menu literally saved us a minimum of $25.00. As each plate was finished, it was picked up. As each bucket of rice and teapot was emptied, another filled one took their places. And as each water glass neared the bottom, a pitcher came by and quickly filled it right back up. At the end of our meal, we were brought out a plate full of large orange slices as a dessert/cleanser. We received the check promptly. Simply aces all around! �Parking was ample as they have a private lot. But, there are many to be found along Las Tunas Dr. and any surrounding side streets. Overall, Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant blew all of us away, and whenever we are in the area, they will be our number one choice to grab a meal! I found absolute value as noted by the prices I quoted above (total bill was around $41.00 before tip, but they got a huge tip from us), and the food was good, too! The atmosphere was very spacious like a school lunchroom with round tables and booths all over the place. The d巆or is simple and functional. The attire is completely casual, so I expect to don a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops the next time I eat here (and there will be a next time). It pains me to do this, but I will have to knock half-a-star off. Although they accept credit cards, they don't take my credit card of choice...AMEX! (actual rating: 4 �/2 stars)

I am hugely disappointed by the 6lbs of lobster that we ordered for $90. All 7 of us agreed that the taste did not match the high price and we even had leftover. We were also very disappointed by the salt and pepper crab as well. I think that was pricey as well and barely anyone was touching it. Standout dishes were beef loc lac, fried tofu, and fried pork. We ordered about 10+ dishes. 蔜he basil clam dish was pretty good with clams being pretty big. This place is good for groups. 蔛ervice was pretty good for a chinese place. If you don't order the lobster, I think the price is very reasonable here. 蔖robably won't be coming back here. 蔍 think the lobster dish at Chinois in Main trumps this high priced lobster dish here.

A great experience owed to the medium sized, 6lb lobster that we killed. 蔐arry the lobster was juicy and full of sweet meat, covered in a delicious salt and pepper sauce - he was quite literally the star of the show. 蔄t $100, I would've gone nuts if he didn't deliver. �Our group ordered the family set menu with 5 dishes and added a tofu dish. 蔄 majority of those dishes were decent - the clams and the fish were the more memorable ones. �At lunch time, the place was crowded but we had some friends who arrived early and got us a table. 蔠ait staff was surprisingly friendly for a joint such as this. 蔠ith the bill divided by 7, not too much damage was done and everyone went home satisfied. There is a small parking lot, but you're better off looking for street parking at peak hours. I'll definitely be back here again!

i'm gonna add to the glowing reviews and reiterate what to order from the previous 1000+ comments. the house special lobster is def worth trying (fyi their 'small' is around 4.5 lbs at $16/lb). i tried the bo luc lac and i did not find it to be that great; it's actually too much meat if you order it in conjunction with the lobster. i found that a good combination for a party of 2 is the 1) lobster, 2) some sort of veg, and 3) the fried tofu - which is my personal fave.

I have been coming to this place for years, even back at its old location! Parking can be a little difficult at times when the restaurant is packed. For large groups, the have private-like rooms on the side which is great for family gatherings. Their lobster is really good, along with their elephant clams (xiang ba bang), kung pao chicken, and clams. Although it is a little pricey, the good food makes it all worth it! They also have lunch specials Monday to Friday. They're normally pretty packed during the weekends so go early!

I've been here twice. 3 months ago was my first time. We went around 3 so there was really no wait. We ordered things recommended by the fellow yelpsters. Pea Sprout, Lobster and all the others. It was a good meal. Had the Fischer Beer they recommended from France. Second time there was fathers day weekend- Saturday early dinner around 5:30pm, we waited about 30minutes (long enough for me to spot the "C" rating from the health dept. Killed my appetite. The line kept growing and there were about 50 people waiting outside when we were leaving. Is it worth it? Couple of tips: Beware the man who seats you, I want to say he is the owner? Half balding Chinese older man, he calls your number but it's a moment out of Seinfeld...."Cartright fo 4". Make sure to listen for your number. The man supposedly called our number and our names got crossed off. 蔊ood thing we checked. Tip #2, Check the bill carefeully - they add things to your bill that you didn't order. Go ahead, try it out...even with the "c" rating...just pray you don't sit near the kitchen, go when there is no wait...and judge it for yourself.

One of the better upscale Chinese food places around. 蔜he seafood special which you have to preorder is $75 but it is quite good. 蔇ef a place to go with a group or you don't mind spending money. 蔊reat ambiance, nice clean seating...and def a perfect place for family style eating.

OK!! 蔙OAD TRIP!! 蔭te a mediocre breakfast in the bay area, and drove on down south. 蕄ulled into town, checked into the hotel..and it was time to address the very empty stomachs...yelp reviews look positive, so off we went to participate in some lobster's death. �i think we ate at the old rundown restaurant before?) we got to the restaurant fairly early, so we were seated right away. 蕎e ordered the house special lobster, spicy..and some other dishes.. 蔲irst thing i noticed were the sub par dinner forks. 蔯heap stamped steel forks..all the ones within reach were BENT!! 蔠TF? 蕎hen the nice, smiling man brought us our "small" lobster, it was quick to figure out what bends all the forks. 蕋he cheap forks were the perfect go-to tool to dig out the succulent sweet, spicy, hot, briny, gingery, garlicky..lobster meat!! 蔵 pretzeled my fork with some advance lobster freeing moves..man it was good!! 蔵 wish i wasnt on the wagon, or i would have ordered some spicy hard alchohol drink...some scotch? 蕀aybe some cognac? 蔰aaaaaammmmnnnn!! 蔵t woiuld have been great. service was great. 蕋hey duck in and out like vest and white shirt wearing ninjas..changing out your lobster "bone" plate for a fresh plate. 蔵 am no lobster expert, but this behemoth was not fished out of the waters of Maine..we got a small lobster, and this thing was a force to reckon with. 蕎e also ordered a veggie chow mein platter that was dull in flavor next to the lobster..our salty, pork and shrimp lettuce wraps were a perfect pairing..the filling was hot and spicy, perfumed with lemon grass and basil..the cool lettuce vessel to deliver the package to your mouth was 蕎elcome contrast. sad, this place is so far from home..but good thing too..the food isnt cheap. 蕂ur lobster alone was $75...geesh. �acceptable, for an occasional splurge, no doubt :D)

Yes, every raves about this place. I have been here around 10 times and have had poor service a few times. Last time I was here, we ordered their large crab (which was market price). We all agreed it was frozen and definitely not fresh. The price for just the crab was $97! Definitely will steer my friends away from here.

Yum! this place is delish, but he wait is craaaaazy. 蔄lways tons of people outside waiting for a table. 蔍 came for a friends' b-day dinner. came with a whole group of people for the b-day I can't remember exactly what we ordered but it was all really delish. The service is ... somewhat lacking, we waited forever for a server to come, eventually we left our little private room and flagged down a server to come, but maybe thats just how chinese restaurnts are. No Peking duck here though, just a FYI. 蔊ood food but.... I'm not sure if I'd wait an 蔴our or longer for chinese food.

I came here for a birthday dinner, and although I wasn't able to try all too many things (15 people crowded around a table with a set number of dishes means just a bite from each plate IF that), I did enjoy the two things immensely: the shaking beef and the crab. If I may be so bold, I must say that I liked the shaking beef more than I liked the crab. :x I was thankful that my boyfriend (who was with me at the birthday dinner) was able to snatch the crab pieces for me (and he even took out the meat for me ;)) so that I could truly enjoy what the hype was all about. Oh man the meat was so juicy!!! They really did a number on the ingredients they used to marinate this dish. It wasn't salty, it wasn't sweet, and it wasn't greasy at all. Taking some of the juice from the dish and adding it to the rice = heavenly. :) As for the shaking beef, I had a bite of it at the birthday dinner but when I went again the second time for another birthday celebration, I ordered just the shaking beef and I got to enjoy it in all of its glory to myself! The meat is prepared extremely well; it's a perfect marriage of flavor, texture, and portion. There was so much beef, I had to take half of it home! If you like meat that is tender and perfectly medium-rare, then I suggest you order this. For those of you who like well-done beef, then don't order it. :p My friends also had the catfish soup, and they really enjoyed it. Even when they got the remaining dish to-go, they put it in a boba cup and sealed it at the top as they would milk tea. Haha! I also enjoyed the fried tofu as well; although the tofu looks dried up like chips, it was actually really tasty and plump. I recommend these dishes as well. The wait, as you would expect, is long. However, unless you have a HUGE group, it's really not that bad. The first birthday dinner with 10+ people -- they had to wait two hours. For my second visit there, I waited maybe an hour for the four of us to be seated. (And we sat in a booth near the window which provided a nice ambience to the occasion.) Parking is a hassle. I suggest going carpooling, parking blocks away and walking, or taking the bus. :P Haha just kidding. But really, it'd be worth the bus trip. I'll be back, Newport Tan Cang. Next time I go, I'm going to order the shaking beef AND the crab next time I go -- just for myself! ;)

It was my first time here. I came with my family and they loved everything we ordered. 蔒y family loves and appreciates good Chinese food but they're also very critical if its not good. Well, Newport Tan Cang got the thumbs up from them. We ordered the House Special Lobster (delicous), the Beef Loc Lac (melt in your mouth greatness), House Special Rice Noodle aka Chow Fun (very good), and the sauteed Pea Sprouts with extra garlic (delectable). Even with the 3.5 pound lobster, we walked out of there under $100 (for 4 of us) and we took away about half of our food in leftovers for another awesome meal tomorrow. This place rocks!

I was looking for a new place to try while running errands in the SGV and yelp pointed me in this direction at the end of lunch rush. First impression: 蔜he modern decor is inviting and you are greeted by the giant tanks filled by king crabs, lobster, geoduck, etc. 蔍f I was a kid, I'd probably spend 15 minutes just looking at them. 蔜he decor in the waiting area is pretty interesting with lanes red lanterns above and small wooden planks in the wall. Food: 蔛ince it was just a party of two, I didn't dare order the House Special Lobster. 蔛imply 蕂rdered off the lunch specials menu: Chicken with Garlic Sauce - Soooo oily! 蔜asty, I was expecting the typical garlic sauce you get everywhere else, but it's was unique and there were plenty of veggies. Cashew Shrimp - 蔠hen the server put it down, I almost sent it back because it didn't look like Cashew Shrimp. 蔜here were almost no cashews! 蔍 know they're kind of pricey, but are you really going to skimp on a dish called CASHEW shrimp? 蔍t was tasty, but equally oily as the first dis. Spicy Basil Fish Filet - 蔍 didn't like the first bite of it, but it grew and grew on it. 蔣um! I will have to come back at some point and get the Beef Lo Lac and House Special Lobster.

Took a gamble and decided to take the family (mom, pops, bro, and the wife) to Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant (NTC) based solely on Yelp reviews despite never going there before. Fortunately, like the New York Knicks, the gamble paid off because NTC is fucking "Linning!" NTC serves really delicious food. However, what really makes the place interesting is that the restaurant does not serve your typical San Gabriel Valley Chinese cuisine. Rather, NTC serves Cantonese food with a Southeast Asian twist, which surprisingly, works very well. But before I get into the good, let's get the bad out of the way. �Everyone will tell you that NTC is all about the lobster. Let's just say that I am not everyone. Perhaps, I'm the only fucker in the world that didn't think their lobster dish was that great. I mean, you have to look at things in context since I've always thought that lobster was overrated. After all, is it just me or don't lobsters resemble an oversized swimming insect (i.e. earwig, scorpion, beetle)? Regardless, in general, lobster's turn off for me has always been the fact that they are always overpriced and there just isn't enough meat. I think if I could do it again, I would get the crab despite crabs resembling and probably tasting like spider... at least that's what Bear Grylls (Man Vs. Wild guy) would probably tell you. Back to the lobster... NTC's lobster is sold at market price and when we happened to go, a medium-sized 5-pound lobster ran us about $80 (approximately $15 a pound). While I admit these lobsters are ginormous leviathans, take away the shell and the meat is just not enough to fill you up. It's akin to thinking you have the Incredible Hulk in front of you, but when you take off the shell all you have left is puny Edward Norton (aka Dr. Bruce Banner). Also, it's not first date food because you will end up with some slimy hands. Don't get me wrong, the lobster dish is good, but what really makes it rock is not the lobster but the seasoning - fried ginger, chili, black pepper, garlic, and scallion. I mean, once the lobster was gone, I found myself mixing the seasoning with my rice. Aside from the lobster, Yelpers recommended the French-style beef (bo lac lac), and the pea sprouts. The French-style beef, a by-product of France's colonization of Southeast Asia, consisted of tender meat medallions saut巈d in a unique sauce that was served with a side of lime and salt. It was an interesting combination of flavors that took me three helpings before I really grew to like it. Let's just say, I kept spinning the "lazy Susan" like a DJ to ensure I had more beef! Also, the pea sprouts were really good. Saut巈d in a garlic sauce, they were really fresh and I ended up mixing the sauce with my rice. Definitely a tasty and refreshing dish that you must order when visiting NTC. Being a party of five, we ordered an extra dish, a dish that wasn't really recommended by Yelp - Kung Pao Chicken. My father loves this dish and he always ends up ordering it and so I didn't expect much from it. However, I'm glad he ordered it because the Kung Pao Chicken was really flavorful and it led to my dad proclaiming that he wished he had multiple stomachs like a cow. Although, at the end of the day he looked more like a pig. All things considered, everything that we ordered at NTC in terms of flavors was damn tasty. However, WHEN I come back, I will stay away from the lobster because it's just not worth it. I mean, had we not ordered the lobster, our bill would have been $50-60. Now that's a bargain! Moreover, based on the dishes that I tried, I'm curious to see what other great dishes NTC has to offer. --------------------------------------- *Loved the free individual cups of sweet and sour soup NTC provided. Great way to start off the meal because everything tastes better when it's freeeeeeeee! **Our server was this cute older man that could pass for the Chinese version of "Popeye". ***If you have peanut allergies, you may want to stay away from the Kung Pao Chicken or you may end up getting Kung Pao'd. ****Beware their porcelain tea spouts. For the life of me, I can't figure them out because I kept spilling tea all over the table. After the third spout, I managed to reduce some of the spillage during pouring by holding the top down.

Wonders why it took me so long to venture to SGV to discover this place. Wow, this place is crowded. Interesting restaurant as it is a mix of Chinese and Vietnamese. The dish to get here is lobster which the server told me 90% of the people eat here. I t is true as I walked over to the restroom and most people had the huge place of lobster at their table. �Can be expensive if you order lobster at $60+. Get the beef lac loc as that is also what they are known for. Lunch specials looked like an awesome deal. Parking lot was packed so I can imagine parking can be a pain here.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant. I've been a handful of times and can say that it's my to go place for crab. It's possibly the best stir fry crab i've had. In my opinion, crab is more flavorful than lobster and cheaper to boot. The other dishes I try to get are: Beef luc lac- Tender and delicious. The flavor is all there but you can add some more with the dipping sauce they give you. The fried sole? (some sort of fish) - My dad goes fishing all the time so I rarely order fish from restaurant, but someone in our group ordered it and i'm glad they did. It was not fishy tasting and their preparation was excellent. Okay they just fry it but the accompanying sauce is soo good. It's thicker than fish sauce, a little sweeter and tangier. Pea sprouts - A very good side veggie dish. Clams with basil - Fresh and tasty. The sauce on the clams is light and lets the clam flavor come through. The basil is fresh. If you go before 4:45? [i think] you can catch their lunch special. And best part is, there is no wait at that time.

If you can make it for their lunch special it is indeed a good value because they make some seriously good food. However, even if you came during lunch time the real stars of the menu are only listed on the regular menu at full price. You know that face that Food Network chefs make when they taste their completed dish....that mmmm, this is so f'ing good face??? Yeah, be prepared to make that face with ALL the dishes below: -Newport Special Lobster (this ain't no lame assed boiled lobster that you dip into clarified butter! This is stir fried, with a hint of spicyness AND includes lobster eggs! What?!) - Crab with Curry Sauce (this is the first time I've ever tasted this wonderful combination....yeah, I'm making the face just thinking about it.) -Elephant Clam Sashimi (2 Styles) (the 1st preparation is a salad and the 2nd is a soup. Super pricey, but damn good! Would I get it again? Hell no! It was an $80 dish!!) -Sauteed Peasprout (I know! It doesn't sound impressive but it's good, surprisingly so...hence the face.) It seems like a lot of food...and it is. There were only 2 of us and the waiter tried to tell us it was too much but we just took it as a challenge. We were going to prove our waiter wrong!!! ...And an hour later, we were stuffed and doggy bagging everything. NG....Monster eating challenge, failed but on the upside we both agreed, BEST seafood meal to date!

Of course, the lobster here none can compare... It's worth the 30 min circling around the neighborhood for parking and another hour waiting in line (no reservation). however, my family stops coming here because more than once, they overcharged us on the bill (cash only, btw). And when my mom shared the story to her friends, many of them shared similar stories as well. I'm still a fan of their food, just not their integrity. Consumer beware!

The House Special Lobster is delicious, but way overpriced. We ordered 1 and it cost us roughly $100 for that thing. We tore through that thing & I don't recall any of us having any piece of the tail, which is the meatiest part. We also ordered Beef Chow Fun, Beef Luc Lac, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Salt & Pepper Shrimp, etc...We ordered a lot and I can't remember the rest. Everything was delicious and our 2 waiters were always on top of things checking up on us often. If only the lobster wasn't overpriced, I'd give them a higher rating.

I would have given it five stars if we ordered the lobster, but there were only 3 of us and one wanted to order the Vietnamese Style Shrimp Salad (which was one of the best salads she has ever tried!) We ordered: Chow Fun: Yummy, no complaints. Shrimp with Garlic Sauce: DELICIOUS. Simply delicious. A must-order. Noodles with Black Bean Sauce: DON'T DO IT. TOO SALTY and the fried egg noodles were gross..it was so salty I couldn't finish it. Kung Pao Chicken: some Yelper said it was the best he has ever tried, so I had to order it. But....how many places are known for their Kung Pao Chicken? This plate was aight. They didn't fry the chicken, though! It was stir-fried, so that's a plus (if you're thinkin' healthy!). Overall, it's a good Chinese restaurant for their regular items, but the 5-starness comes from their outstanding seafood. Get the lobster if you want to have a scrumptious feast. :)

Between 3.5 stars and 4 stars. We ordered the House Special Lobster, it's the one thing almost every table gets. A must try. It was good but I've had better. The Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant in Rowland Heights makes a more delicious House Special Lobster. (Both restaurants have the same name but I don't think they are affiliated.) I can't explain it since both places seem to use the same aromatics (green onion, garlic) but the coating on the Lobster in Rowland Heights is better done and tastier, and the Lobster comes out hotter. This atmosphere at Newport in San Gabriel is far better and more comfortable. The booths with the round red lamps above are so cute. I enjoy looking at the tank filled with Alaskan King Crab in front. The waiters are also more attentive here. They were mostly silent but they kept switching us to clean plates and were very prompt. Overall, the experience at San Gabriel is far more relaxing but Rowland Heights has the tastier Lobster. Your pick where to go. Prices at both places are comparable. The Lobster is about $15.95 per lb, with the smallest Lobster at around 4+ lbs. �That way there's quite a bit of meat.) Dinner here easily runs more than $100+ especially if you order more than lobster. (Even if you only get 2 or 3 dishes total). A once a lifetime experience since it is pricey. Also, I'm not sure we got the whole Lobster tail - I know we got some, but not sure if it was all.

Best seafood place in town. You really can't go wrong with anything here but a few of my favorites are the lobster, fish with basil, chicken lettuce wrap, and filet minion cubes. I especially like that are generous with the servings. The lobster is always fresh and doesn't fall apart like other lower quality lobster restaurants. The fish with basil and steam fish with soy sauce is especially meaty and fresh. Oh and I never leave without an order of the fish and crab or catfish soup. Absolutely hits the spot. I don't care for clams at all but some people seem to like them. My sister especially like the fried squid and walnut shrimp. I thought they were both good as well. I came here once 5 days straight for various special occasions and it was probably the highlight of my 2011. They also have a pretty wide wine collection here. We had the 2008 Insignia Cab ourselves and it was marvelous. My only complaint is the wait. They've already moved once. Now I think it's time for a second location.

The food here was GREAT. I would make another trip out here solely for the lobster. The only problem I ran into was the hostess had skipped us. We got our number, paranoid that our number may be skipped, we inquired a couple times about whether or not our number had been called because of the hectic wait line . Even though we had stood merely 10 feet away from the hostess, our number got skipped. We found out when we had asked a third time and so she kindly put us next in line. I was a little exasperated at the fact that our number was skipped. But it was quickly subdued when we got to our table. The decor was nice and even though it was late into the evening, the restaurant was still packed. I believe the lobster came first and me and my gf ate the whole thing. We had about three more dishes coming and we ate as much as we could with what space was left in our stomachs. We feasted late into the night and had completely kicked the trip back up to San Jose to the back of our minds. This was truly a moment when I could say "I was thinking with my stomach and not with my dic...I mean, brain."

The special lobster was exactly that. 蔍t was delicious, the waiter recommend the sizzling fish it was delicious fried in a batter and then it sizzle with a sweet like sauce. 蔠e got the fried tofu, ok. 蔠e usually get the black bean clams and the waiter recommend the basil one. 蔍t was good but we like the black bean one much better. 蔜he filet mignon french style was ok not something I would order again. 蔜he fried oyster was great but thy only give you 8 pieces. 蔜he hot and sour soup and the lobster are repeat favorites for me.

My friends and I have been on a quest to conquer the 2009 list by Jonathan Gold called "99 things to eat in LA before you die." 蔉rom day one when we read the list, Newport Seafood's special lobster was one that instantly stuck out to us and we couldn't wait to do. 蔠ell, almost 3 years later, we finally were able to get a group together to do it. The food at Newport seems like fancier versions of standard fare Chinese food, but heavily influenced on the seafood. 蔅ecause of that, it carries a premium price. We got, in this order: * Beef Loclac: 蔕ne of my favorites of the night. 蔞ery moist and tender beef (likely tenderloin), sauteed in a simple sauce with some black pepper. 蔅ut it was oddly served over what looks like hamburger garnishes (raw tomatoes, lettuce and onions). �* Sauteed Peasprouts: Not a favorite at our table but I quite enjoyed them. 蔍 love a simple Chinese green sauteed with garlic (the best being morning glory, of course). 蔅ut the peasprouts were unique and something I hadn't tried before. 蔠ould order again. * House Seafood Soup: 蔴ad some squid, pork, shrimp, cabbage and some other things in it. 蔔othing was standout about this soup. 蔍t tasted a little dirty/murky, and seemed like it contained cheap freezer-aisle ingredients. * Peking Style Pork Chop: a little sweet, the meat was tender and good. 蔛till attached to the bone, which annoyed some, but its really not that big of a deal. 蔍 found the sauce too sweet to my liking, but what do I know, I'm a white guy from Minnesota. * Clams with hot pepper sauce: these were fine. Tiny. 蔇idn't seem like the highest quality of clams. 蔛auce didn't have much going on. 蔍 tried a few and then forgot about them. 蔒ore work than worth. * Kung Pao Chicken: 蔍 instantly hate myself for thinking this was one of the better dishes on the table. * Baked crab & shrimp: 蔄 good dish, but difficult to eat. 蔍 ended up just being lazy and eating the legs and shells of the shrimp like I did in Shenzhen. 蔔o big deal. * Steamed whole fish: 蔍 am a huge fan of whole fish. 蔍 think cooking whole fish is the perfect way to trap in the moisture and succulence. 蔍 usually grill or roast my whole fish, however. 蔍 have never had it steamed. 蔠hile the flesh of the fish itself was tasty, I did not like the texture that this gave to the skin. 蔜he skin was thin and slimy and seemingly difficult to get away from the fish. 蔜he other flavors, however, were spot on. * Newport Special Lobster: 蔜he whole reason we came. 蔄 $79, 5-lb beast of a lobster. 蔉ried, I guess? 蔍 really don't get how they prepared it. 蔍t was tasty, but not groundbreakingly-so. 蔍t is very weird for me to eat lobster without butter, but this is the whole reason we came... Chinese lobster had been an elusive concept to me, so I was intending to eat it how it was presented. 蔍t wasn't spicy, as some say, and while it was succulent, it seemed slightly overcooked. 蔜here was a rubberiness to it that I am not excited about seeing in such an expensive dish. 蔜hat being said, it was still one of my favorite dishes on the table. All in all, we had a decadent meal where many of us got to try new things. 蔠as it the best seafood in the world? 蔔o. 蔠as it the best Chinese Seafood I've had? 蔔o. 蔠as it a waste of $38 per person? 蔔ot really, considering how much we had. 蔍'm glad I went, I'm glad we conquered the huge ocean beast, but I am not going to be rushing back any time soon.

Came here for Chinese New Years Eve Dinner with my family, party of 7. We purposely came early because we knew it would be packed, and would be at least a half hour wait. 蔜hey have a large parking lot but it was full so I parked in the street and walked, which was perfectly fine. The restaurant looks like it was originally a Marie Calendars or similar place, then gutted out and remodeled. 蔠hen I got there, I realized I'd actually eaten here before a few years before, but it was called Newport Lobster or something like that but seems to be the same restaurant with same owners and decor. 蔈ven though it was packed, we were seated pretty quickly at a large dining table which was good because we had my sister's 2 little kids. They loved looking in the pool of giant lobsters too. The waiters were very accommodating and quickly brought us tea and water (on request) and took our order. 蔜he food was fresh, elegant (for chinese food) and tasty. 蔠e had: -Newport Special Crab (loved it) -Lettuce cups with ground pork appetizers -Seafood soup -French Style Beef (my favorite dish) -Fish Filet with basil -Sauteed pea sprout -Fried noodles with seafood -Chicken with black bean sauce Surprisingly, the service was excellent and they were quick to accommodate even though the place was packed. 蔍 asked for the hot sauce and they brought us a whole bottle of siracha which was nice. �5 min after being seated, we looked over at the waiting line and it was out the door. 蔄lso, after dinner they brought out orange slices and must have heard my 6 year old niece exclaim how much she loved oranges, so they brought another plate out for us. 蔞ery nice touch! Great dinner, will definitely be back soon.

Came here on recommendation of the beautiful Grace L. and I'm so glad we did! The house special lobster lived up to its name -- the sauce was a fantastic complement to the lobster without overpowering it. You could really tell the lobster was fresh (tanks of them) and the lobster meat was tender/chewy just the way it should be. The clams were also a great surprise. Since we already had other heavily flavored dishes, we went with the steamed clams. With such a simple preparation, the clams themselves have to be really good/fresh, and Newport didn't disappoint. 蔜he clams were large and juicy, and very fresh. Overall, the portion sizes did not disappoint, the food exceeded expectation, and I loved that for an asian restaurant the tables and chairs were all well-spaced so patrons were all comfortably seated instead of crammed in like canned sardines.

What exactly am I missing here? This place is mediocre at the very best so I'm pretty amazed that this place even has 4.5 stars with over 900 reviews. What amazes me even more is that they can call themselves a seafood restaurant and serve me the sloppy corn-starch mess they call food. Newport Seafood isn't authentic Chinese food. If you think it is, you're severely deluded. And if you're Chinese at the same time, you need to call up whatever relative you have over in China and apologize to them for being a sad and sorry immigrant who will eventually bring down the family name. Apparently, this restaurant has some Viet influence, but I'm not exactly sure where this Viet infusion fits in with kung pao beef, steamed fish, black bean clams, stir-fried veggies. It all seems pretty "Chinese" to me. There are a couple of Viet dishes on the menu but it's probably safe to say that they aren't any good either. Let's start with the basics and work our way up. When I first stepped into the place, it had all the trappings of an authentic Chinese seafood restaurant: waiters yelling at each other in Cantonese, bubbling fish tanks with fresh seafood, and a long wait. But all it takes is another two steps have entire the facade of authenticity smashed. First warning sign, the crowd was incredibly mixed, and by mixed I mean not Chinese. I'm all for diversity, but when it comes to Chinese restaurants in SoCal, its best to keep it kosher. Second warning, kung pao beef. If this "seafood" restaurant has even a modicum of self-respect, they wouldn't put kung pao beef, beef broccoli, cashew chicken, and other generic American-Chinese monstrosities on their menu. It's borderline criminal. First came the rice and it was weak. Rice is the staple of every Chinese meal and this rice was wet and soggy and smells like cardboard. It came in a container that can only be described as something a bed-ridden patient would use to defecate in. Chinese people always talk about fan-heung (rice fragrance), this pot of rice is very much the antithesis of the term. Next was the free hot and sour soup and by golly it was horrific. If I wanted hot and sour soup, I'll go to Panda Express, not here. This soup tasted neither hot nor sour, it tasted like starch. That's right, starch. There's so much corn starch in this soup I can flip it upside down real fast and not have it spill. This soup was made to offend. Moving along, we had steamed fish. Steamed fish pretty much the backbone of every respectable seafood restaurant. Yet this 4.5 star seafood restaurant manged to screw that up. They didn't have grouper, nor do they have red cod. All they had was tilapia. How pathetic. The fish was tough and chewy, and it tasted stale and fishy. What? How's that possible? it's a steamed fish! It's supposed to be smooth, fresh, sweet, and flaky, glistening in fish soy sauce and hot oil. I know why! Probably because its sewer-quality tilapia cooked by a half-witted line cook. Stir-fried Chinese spinach was next. It was okay, but overcooked. The veggies weren't fresh and green but dull and lifeless. Probably the most basic dish on the menu but they still manage to mess it up. Clams in black bean sauce, which was supposed to be the star of our lunch, came afterwards. This dish was actually okay tasting. Nothing to holler about though. That being said, the sauce was so thick and billowy it destroyed the whole dish entirely. Why the hell do you need to use so much corn-starch to thicken the sauce? Are they insane? That's so 80s. There was also a fair bit of grit in the clams. Wash more. Unsatisfied, I also ordered a beef fried noodles (bad move). Terrible. Fried noodles are supposed to be crispy and fragrant covered in a beef based sauce with slices of flank steak and assorted veggies. The dish came out cold and the noodles were soggy. Obviously the tool of a waiter didn't bring out the dish the moment it was ready; a death-sentence to any fried noodle dish. The noodles were too thick and it wasn't browned enough to be crispy. Everything was swimming is the brown corn-starched sludge. I scooped this whole mess into a to-go box and tried to forget about it. Thankfully I didn't order any lobster. Knowing that they couldn't even get the basics right, I'd be stupid to drop any kinda cash for something they will most certainly screw up. This restaurant is bad like a lot of Chinese restaurants around here. Shame on all you folks for thinking that this place is good. And considering the price, you're getting ripped off for the quality of food you're getting. I wouldn't say this place is a disappointment because I had low expectations walking in. That said, I was appalled with already low-expectations. Go figure.

NTC seafood is an Asian go-to restaurant in the SGV that is overrun with Asian family style diners and perpetually long wait times for a table. 蔠hile waiting over half an hour for a table (even after the noon hour rush), our hero was tempted to just get a bento box from the Mitsuwa across the street. The food though was alright, with the fried fish, bo luc lac, and garlic green beans being standout items. 蔜heir braided crab meat and fish soup was fairly light on the seafood. 蔈ven though the beef luc lac was good, our hero's table still had to play lazy susan roulette to see who would finish it. PROS: - Good variety of seafood. - Excellent French style Bo Luc Lac beef. CONS: - Their seasonal seafood dishes are overpriced. �51 for a 3 pound fried fish? =( - 20% of the cutlery on the table was bent or dirty. - Long wait times for tables. - Crowded parking lot full of incompetent drivers.

There's a 'people love us on Yelp' sticker outside and I'm not surprised whatsoever. I've been going to this restaurant for years and I can speak to it's Chinese (Hong Kong style) authenticity. The food is affordable (especially at lunch) and you can walk away feeling satisfied. Depending on when you go there can be a wait, just be sure to get a number right away when you walk in. As for ordering dishes, I go with the minimum 1 person to 1 dish ratio. Dishes I always get (p.s. I might be butchering the names since I order in Chinese): Kung Pao Chicken - The chicken is perfectly crisp and covered a soy-flavored sauce. It comes with these arguably large dried chile peppers but unless you bite into the peppers themselves the dish isn't spicy. Fish with Basil - It's deep fried fish (to seal in the flavor) covered with a thick clear sauce and lots and lots of basil. Delicious! Salt and Pepper Fried Pork - Salty and sort of fatty fried pork dipped into lime and pepper. Lobster - This is for special occasions. It's delicious. I don't know why lobster is served with butter, it's much better this way. 蔣ou usually can ask how heavy the lobsters are to get an idea of the cost. I never order vegetables dishes--no wait, I did once but it wasn't very good. I suggest sticking with the meat and seafood! A quick tip, if you order things like the salt and pepper fried pork or the lobster be sure to scoop up the little bits of fried stuff, peppers, and onions to eat with your rice. That's arguably the best part.

i have two words for you: HOUSE LOBSTER It's the meal that makes your eye glisten and electrifies your insides. What do you say? Food can't do that to you? Try this and Think again, brother. think again. On a serious note, we drove a little out of our way to come eat here because of the endless reviews and although the service was pretty awful during our wait period, our faith was restored once we were sat down. Service was prompt, ordering was easy and every dish we ordered was incredible. Four people were able to eat a Medium House Lobster, Salt and Pepper Crab (would skip), pea sprouts, Bo Luc Lac (must try) and soup. We murdered it with exception to one lonely crab leg. The meal came out to be around $180.00 and I will be forever grateful for the generosity of our friend! Unlike other places, this one is best to come in a large group, preferably 5+ because they have a TON of huge tables and you could try more things. New Tan Cang is just one place you just should not skip!

My 500th review! I decided to bring family here for Christmas day and Thank goodness we all met at 11:25 BC the parking lot was filling up quickly. Inside the restaurant was 3/4 full and they had just opened. We ordered the $80.00 banquet dinner: Catfish hot and sour Soup: Many pieces of fresh catfish, veggies and pineapple but lacked sour flavor, suggest they keep this on a burner to maintain heated temperature. Clam with spicy basil sauce: Large clams with a great tasting basil sauce. Baked crab with salt & pepper: OK, deep frying the crab dried out the crab meat in my opinion. Kung Pao beef: Flavor full and tasty with a nice portion. Stir fried pea-sprouts: Large portion and was cooked perfectly. Steamed talapia: On the small side but was fresh and tasty. Service and cleanliness of the Newport Seafood is above average for an Asian eatery and they constantly replace your dirty plates and refill hot water for your tea. Only con here was that they were trying to rush you out BC there was a hungry mob waiting to eat. Visa or MasterCard only no Am-ex accepted.

We came here on a weekday dinner during the holidays and waited 1 hr, 25 mins for a party of 9. It was insane! The private parking lot is small; you'd be lucky to get a spot if you came during busy hours. What's worse is people don't know how to back out from the lot, causing more traffic and fustration for hungry patrons. Street parking is available, all doable walking distance. When we walked in, there was hardly any room to stand without our personal space being violated. I'm pretty sure the fire marshall could have fined them - total max occupancy was def maxed out. We continued to stay because it had great reviews and our birthday friend chose it. =-) The restaurant is large with more private seating areas for larger parties. It looks clean and new, and the wait staff are quick and friendly. I don't even know what we ordered, all I know is that I sat down and ate everything in sight. There was crab that was super duper delicious; a bunch of veggie dishes like green beans, spinach and bok choy that were awesome; some kind of french style beef that was very good and juicy; some type of frie catfish that was fresh and yummy; and kung pao chicken that was so much better here than any place else I can remember. Meals are served with steamed rice, soup, and hot tea while portions are family style. I believe the bill came down to approximately $40 per person. I was thoroughly full and happy and would come here again given I don't have to wait that long again.

Lobster is their special house menu. If you have not get a chance to try please do! It is different from other places. Their taste of foods are unique, my family loves the way they cook their lobsters. We usually go as family reunion and we ordered the family pack which comes in variety of foods. As well with lobsters of course. NEVER not order it! Their KUNG PAO CHICKEN... I rate it as 5 STARS! Best place to try! The service is impeccable!! However, the parking is a bit hard to find because everyday packed! TEENSpot

I'm not Chinese, and no, I don't eat a lot of good Chinese food... but this place made me feel so greasy and heavy inside, it was gross. The food tasted good going down though! We went with a huge group for a friend's surprise going-away party, so we pre-ordered their 7 course dinner. It consisted of all their well-known dishes, including the crab and lobster. I enjoyed the deep-fried tofu because it was lightly crispy on the outside, and delightfully soft inside. I also liked the fried pork chop. As for the lobster and crab, I love my seafood, but this crap was hard to eat with a chopstick. Digging the meat out of the shell was a job that I didn't sign up for. However, once you got it out (if it didn't fly across the room), it was delicious. The other dishes we had were forgettable... Personally, I didn't see what was so great about this place, but it was completely packed, so I guess everyone loves it!

I like how they make the place very appealing and new so that it doesn't make you feel like you're going to another one of those chinese restaurants out there that just looks the same. I've been there for birthday and mothers day events and the wait is just crazy long. I think the food is about the same for a regular chinese restaurant.

A little pricey but very solid and well presented foods that will make you get out of invite you out of your comfort zone if you're willing. The quest continued with friends to complete J. Gold's 99 list and spicy lobster did sound damn good. The place was quite large, apparently an old Marie Callendars, but were very quick to seat the 7 of us at 8pm on a Wednesday. We went with the $118 banquet meal and a medium lobster (MP was around $70/80) - it was PLENTY of food. Some of us also got $3.50 glasses of wine that tasted like, well, $3.50 glasses of wine. The normally grand precession of dishes came out rather quickly: -House Seafood Soup - calimari, shrimp, pork and someone spottled some tentacles. There was probably much more in here that I didn't even notice. It was fine, nothing stupendous but yes, fishy. The server brought out a large bowl but served us each small bowls that he poured. Kinda nice. -Clam with spicy hot sauce - probably the spiciest item that we had that night, but not even that much so. It was very delicious but full of too many clams (though there were 7 of us so for a smaller party it probably would've been well portioned) -Baked crab with salt & pepper in shrimp - I've never really been into the idea of cutting open animals myself, and sucking out their meats but something about this crap spoke to me. The crab was baked beautifully and you could almost taste it on texture alone - there was just something so appealing - so un-crustacean about it and the meat was tender and tasty. The shrimps too, fried whole, had a similarly inviting feel to them. I had never before beheaded and peeled my own shrimp (it just grossed me out) but there was something about the physical feel of this dish that just made me want to forget everything I ever thought about the barbarity of eating peel and eat shrimp and go for it. -Beef loclac - One of my favorite dishes of the night and probably the table's easiest - since it was just sliced beef, no bones or shells about it. The beef though wasn't just sliced 'beef and broccoli' fare, it was fine chucks of tender meat, possibly sirloin that were simply exceptional. The sauce, too, a dark but not compromising addition that dripped from the sauce and covered the onions below made me come back to this place even when the meat itself was gone and all that's left were beef soaked veggies.. Mmmm.... beef soaked.... -Sauteed peasprouts - nothing too exceptional about these. They were fine, and definitely something I don't usually eat but nothing made me so interested that I would immediately seek them out again. -Peking Style Pork Chop - very good, but a little difficult to eat at time since, the majority of meat was on the bone but MAN was that sauce good. The kind of white boy sweet and sour sauce that you mainland Angelenos like me are used to. A very tasty dish. -Steamed whole fish - again, I had never eaten fish before like this - literally off the bone, head still on, staring at me. But something about the look of this thing, covered in sauce and inviting greens made me give it a shot. It wasn't bad, wasn't that great. I wish I had been a tad more adventurous and tried some of the underside of the fish which was covered in sauce, seemingly soy based, but at least I gave it a shot. -Kung Pao Chicken - This was fine, what you'd expect out of a kung pao chicken dish except some/most of the pieces had bones, which was tricky without that much meat there in the first place. -Newport special lobster - Ah yes, the grand poo bah of the meal. The raison d'etre - and it was presented as soo. I'm sure you've seen picture by now, giant, towering pieces of lobster, Picasso couldn't have rearranged it's body parts better. Unlike most lobsters I"ve had, this one was overtly seasoned and then covered with more peppers and other spices. It was, in fact, delicious. Best lobster ever? Maybe not, but it was VERY good and probably the best dish of the night. It isn't so often that you have lobster that's taste is transformed so much as it is showcased but this lobster was definitely something unique and special. The review may be long-winded but the meal was definitely an adventure, with almost every plate. Though interesting and spectacular in its presentation, the taste didn't always match the excellence in visuals. And though the meal we ordered was suggested for 7-10 people and we were on the smaller end of that, with lobster too, we were all STUFFED. Perhaps we could've gotten the smaller banquet meal but it wouldn't have included some of my favorite dishes (the beef or the pork). We each ended up paying near $40 for a meal that looked like a $60 meal but tasted like a $20 meal.

Came here for dinner with my office and had a really good dinner. We ordered squid, clams, fried rice, soup, beef, Kung Pao Chicken and (DRUMROLL PLEASE) LOBSTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All of the food here is very delicious. The flavor is just not the same as what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. There's gotta be some secret to their cooking. Whatever it is, it makes everything taste great! I just want to talk about the lobster because its the best dish. The lobster is all fried and chopped up for your convenience. You just need to jab your fork into the succulent meat and yank the goodness out. It's a bit salty and a bit spicy. Its kind of like AN EXPLOSION OF AWESOMENESS IN YOUR MOUTH. It is a seafood restaurant so the prices can be a bit high. Our dinner for 6 people with 5 bottles of Tsingtao came to be $150.

My 100th review at my new favorite Chinese restaurant. I came here for a birthday dinner with my family. There was a long wait, but once we got seated, everything was perfect. We got the family meal set (house seafood soup, clam with spicy hot sauce, kung pao chicken, sauteed peasprout, steamed whole fish) and added French beef cubes and crispy fried squid with salt and pepper. My favorite dish was probably the kung pao chicken, which surprised me to no end because it's such a common dish but this was the best I've ever had. All the other food were great too, and the service was incredible, which boggled my mind -- the food came out in less than 10 minutes after we ordered, and they brought everything without even asking (iced water, tea, extra napkins, rice). Our waiter talked to us quite a bit and had a great sense of humor, which I give him major props for because my parents are not easily entertained.

SO GOOD, but SO DAMN PRICEY. I always come with the parents because they've got the cash, but still, I feel so bad when we order like 3 or 4 dishes and the bill comes out to 150-200 bucks because the lobster and fish is freaking gold on a plate. Apparently, my parents think they charge so much because the sauce is absolutely TO-DIE-FOR and no one can really figure it out. Come and be ready to spend--order the lobster and the fried fish and eat yourself to insanity because its so crazy.

The Jumbo Live Shrimp was the size of my hand!!! 蔛ome of the larger ones had eggs. 蔜he meat in these shrimps were so soft and sweet. 蔜he eggs were delicious, as they popped in my mouth! Yes, yes, I know there were alot of exclamation marks in this review. 蔅ut this place really is ALL THAT EXCITING. Just look at the picture of the chair sized crab, hype yourself up for a visit to Newport Seafood soon, and you can see for yourself! HAPPY CHAIR SIZED CRABBING!!!!!!!!!!

If you are coming here for the first time, expect a long wait. 蔜hey do not take reservations and your entire party has to be here for them to seat you. 蔄s soon as you get here, take a number and wait for them to call you. 蔖arking was packed even on Thanksgiving morning at 11:35 a.m. 蔍f there's no parking in the private lot, just park on one of the streets. 蔒ost of them have 2 hour time limit from 8 a.m.-6 p.m. The house special lobster is the one to try if you are here for the first time, and stick with seafood items. 蔍'm sure their beef, chicken, and vegetable dishes are good too but that defeats the point of coming to a seafood restaurant. 蔜he price is seasonal. We paid $15 per pound of lobster but I'm sure you'll pay much more if you go to an American seafood place. 蔜he smallest lobster they had available was about 4 lbs so we paid little over $60 for our lobster. 蔜he lobster tasted fresh and had really good flavor. 蔍'm not sure what style this is, maybe a combination of Chinese and Vietnamese, but it was slightly spicy. 蔍 scooped up all the sauce mixture that was leftover because it was so good. We also ordered the catfish hot & sour soup. This isn't your Chinese style hot & sour soup. 蔍t tasted more like a combination of Thai and Vietnamese. 蔍t has tomatoes and basil in it. 蔜he catfish was really fresh as it had no fishy taste. 蔎ust watch out for the bones when you're eating this soup. Shrimp in garlic sauce was also good but I would've preferred it to be little more spicy and less sweet. �Overall I really liked this place. 蔖robably the best seafood place I've been to. 蔈ven my parents were impressed. 蔍'm not sure if I want to wait during peak hours but would certainly return for a takeout or just come right before they open.

Back in September 3 of us girls had a joint birthday celebration in Vegas which was by far the best Vegas trip. 蔜he day after coming home from Vegas we decided to have dinner altogether at Newport. 蔍 had heard so many good things about this restaurant and was excited to get to eat here, especially for my birthday. �The wait I have to say was ridiculously long for a group of 10, my friend had already been waiting for an hour before we all got to the restaurant and we waited another hour after meeting up. When finally seated I took notice to the decoration, unlike other Chinese/Viet seafood restaurants that can be pretty outdated in decor. 蔜his place wouldn't be too shabby to bring someone on a date to! 蔍t was modern, but still paying homage to the Asian culture...I honestly wouldn't mind if someone brought me here for a dinner date, actually I'd choose this place over Mastros or Ruth Chris any day! �Service was good once we got our table and the ball started rolling.. �Price.. not too sure since we didn't pay, but I know it was over $100 and close to if not $200.. 蔮ut that's really not bad when you realize all the food fed 10 adults. �We ordered the $118 dinner set with the option of Salt & Pepper Shrimp and added a lobster and plate of honey walnut shrimp. �The food was all really tasty. 蔒y favorites were the salt and pepper shrimp, lobster (and I don't even really like lobster or crab to begin with), and the clams. 蔈verything was devoured except maybe the peking style pork chops. 蔍t wasn't disgusting, but the other dishes definitely out-shined it. �I would without a doubt come back here and am considering taking my Mom here for her birthday as well. 蔜he only thing though that I didn't quite enjoy was the wait and the starving people watching you eat while waiting to be seated at their table.

whenever we are in the so. calif area we always make it a point to have dinner at newport bec. of the luclac and the garlic lobster. the new location offers authentic chinese-vietnamese ambience. service is fast altho' on a busy, busy time the wait would be around 45 mins. to an hour---but it's worth the wait, i'd say. the staff is friendly and they are so funny when they talk in tagalog. if you love asian seafood dishes try newport-- but, it's not one of those cheapy kind of chinese restaurant---i would say it's on the pricier side.

OVERHYPED! Please do not go here. It just looks like a "better" chinese family style restaurant but i don't think it is worth it at all. The food is pretty bland, the wait is long, the portions are quite small...and above all that parking is horrendous! �You really need to go back to the "ghetto-er" chinese restaurants to get good food and a bang for your buck. This place is A-OK and that's it. 蔍t's nothing special and I do not recommend coming back here again.. really? you have much more choices. 蔎ust because the place looks new-er and more modern, doesn't mean it tastes any better.

Most amazing lobster ever. Before, I always said that I didn't like lobster. Now I know I don't like western-style lobster. The lobster was a bit expensive, around $80 for a 5-6 pound lobster, but with a group of 8 or 9, we still only paid $25-ish a head. (5-6 pounds of lobster is a lot of lobster!) The menu is really overwhelming and we came with a bunch of white people for a Hanukkah dinner, but the waiter was really helpful and suggested several dishes, all of which were amazing. Go. Eat lobster. Be happy.

Got here before it opened on a sunday morning and the line was already forming!Obviously this place has to be good because the "baby boomer generation"was the majority of the crowd...Upon entering we were given an option to sit in an area of the restaurant where each table was seperated by see thru walls 蔮ut still gave u that sense of intimacy...waaaat da?!no spooning unless u dare to try that eggdrop soup that was super slimy n gooey...it tasted aiiiight but i couldnt get past the texture.I ordered the Pish wt Vasil,Seapood pry rye,and kippy noodle!Awww da pood waz magical!haha with exception to da House Lobster *overrated&overpriced* 2 stars cuz they most definitely got over on us wit da Bill!And I still stand by my opinion on chinese fast food.Which is...Alot of the Dishes taste the same from panda express,various buffets,local mom&pop's and 1000 review restaurants.

My first time here and had very high expectations from all that I've heard about it. 蔙esults.....I was not disappointed. 蔆ame here on a Thurs night with a couple friends and waited about 40 min for a table, which is actually not bad from what I've heard. 蔜he hostess who I think is also the boss lady was very efficient. 蔠hile we were up next for the table but it wasn't quite ready for us yet, she handed us a menu and told us to study. 蔛he came back 15 min later and took our order, while we were still standing around waiting. 蔠e ordered a ton of food and rather than just letting us recklessly spending money, she told us that we over ordered and should take out a dish. 蔜his is what we ended up getting: Newport Lobster Special- HUGE portion but very delicious. 蔍 don't get why ppl always say all the meat is only in the tail because I definitely found plenty of meat every where else. 蔜he seasoning is delicious with a little kick of spice but not too spicy. 蔎ust be warned that you might have to eat it fast as it's not as good when it starts getting cold shrimp with walnut- was very good but nothing more amazing than other restaurants that have good walnut and shrimp. 蔒aybe a good dish to order as your "typical" 蔰ish if you want something less specialized House special noodles- we wanted something chow mein-ish but couldn't decide on meat so the hostess suggested this because it comes with all different kinds of meat from chicken to all seafood types and vegetables like bak choy. 蔜he noodles are the crispy kind with a lot of sauce for you to mix with and then become delicious chow mein beef loc lac- very flavorful and comes on a bed of raw onions which is delicious when eaten together. It also comes with the lemon and salt and pepper mix that you can toss onto the beef sauteed peasprouts- very healthy yet flavorful but it's about what I expect, good but didn't blow my mind. But, hey, gotta eat your greens right? One last note, even on a Thursday night, they were getting more packed later in the night. 蔕nce we were seated, we got NO attention at all from the servers. 蔝nlike other restaurants, there isnt a waiter assigned to your table, it's kinda like grab whoever's attention you can cuz no one cares. 蔛o we had to ask for everything at least twice and everything takes about 15 mins to get to you. 蔄lso, if you ask for too many things all at once, you can expect to only receive half of what you asked for so choose what you want the most wisely..... And I've tried to order in both Chinese and English, thinking maybe ordering in Chinese would speed things up.....it doesn't. 蔜hey are equal opportunity dismissers.

Everyone pretty much mentioned the best dish (Lobster) here among other stuffs so my recommendation for this restaurant is 1. arrive early or very late to avoid the crowd 2. they charge you extra to use the room, which is semi transparent 3. You can order the banquet meal but they only give you 3 lbs lobster, which they said "sorry we sold out, we need to charge you 2-3 extra lbs for the lobsters....I highly doubt they are being honest 4. They charge you for the rice, which is pointless since our meal comes with fried rice I really don't like the smell that sticks on my clothes whenever I ate there. 蔍ts so greasy. 蔛ome of my friends also complained other than the lobster, everything else is very standard just like other Chinese restaurants, which I wholeheartedly agreed.

It's quite amazing what lobster can do to people. It made me wait over an hour for a table for 2. This was a must go to for our socal road trip. We even went around the corner to Half and Half to kill time.. We were slurping on those things like there was no tomorrow. (shout out, their drinks are so delicious : ) Anywhoooo so we waited and waited, and they crossed our names on accident :( still we waited patiently and got seated at a "small" table. which was meant to fit 6 tiny asian or 4 normal people. It was really nice.. I like the booths. Felt very Asia like. We ordered this shrimp dish... SO GOOD ! then came our lobster.. BAM we finihssed that in a jiffy. SO YUMMY. It was their Lobster House Special. My bfan said it was the best lobster he had in his life. He can be picky. So it must mean a lot. I am not that picky, but I loved it : ) I wanted to eat the head, but I didn't think I should. I ate the tail.. it was a NO NO!! It has this gamey fishy taste to it. MAN.. was it for display only?? WTHECK!! :( I wrongly ordered the Cripsy Pan Fried Noodles.. I thoguht they had a garlic noodle version :( I failed.. but that was also good. We looked like pigs ordering so much food. Fun experience.. It was on the pricey side, but I actually don't know how much lobster cost. :( But last time I ordered a crab for lunch and it was ilek $35 bucks. LOL

There's two ways a restaurant should season and serve seafood. 蔕ne is where the chef allows one to appreciate the clean, fresh, ocean taste while enhancing and perfecting the texture of how the seafood is supposed to be. 蔄nd the other way is to stir fry it with garlic, scallions, black pepper, and other seasonings and serve it family style. 蔔ewport Seafood is the best at the latter technique, hands down. After a long day, my friends and I sometime feel like a homey, asian, family style meal and this is the place we usually come to. 蔠e usually order a few dishes such as the steamed fish served in lemongrass broth, the house lobster or crab, some clams in spicy hot sauce, the sweet and sour pork chops, and some walnut shrimp. 蔍 personally don't like the walnut shrimp because I feel like the mayonnaise overwhelms the shrimp which has a subtle distinguished taste that I enjoy. However, if you're undecided on what to order, have fun and pick one of the pre-set family meals based on the amount of people in your party. 蔣ou can't go wrong with their selection. 蔜hey follow the rule of thumb of, however many people in your party you'll get that many dishes + one extra dish. 蔍n example, if you have 4 people, you'll get the cat fish & sour soup, clam with spicy hot sauce, kong pao chicken, sauteed peasprout, and a whole steamed fish. Yummy. For those special occasions like birthdays, graduations, or marriages, order the Banquet meal. 蔜otally worth it. 蔕k, I'll be unpartisan and will list a few cons about this place. Hmm.. service could be better. The wait on certain nights can be long (but that's indicative of how good this place is). Oh, and you might want to bring a spare shirt to change into after dinner because the attire you wore in will smell like food. 蔅ut like I said, the food here is so bomb, it's definitely worth it.

I heard this place was known for their lobster, but we didn't order it. I went with my friends and ended ordering their lunch specials. I like the hot & sour soup that came with it bc it was really spicy--the way I like it. We had the salted pork chop, seafood fried noodles, fried fish filet, and squid with chinese broccoli. The food was tasty too, but like all Chinese food, they probably added a ton of MSG bc I was thirsty afterwards. The waiters were attentive but I felt like we were being rushed to order... FYI, they have their own parking lot but we went on a Sunday afternoon, so parking was hard to find...

Everything was delicious including the house special lobster and clams with basil leaves. 蔜he beef cubes with black pepper sauce (was this meat filet mignon?) were extremely tender and juicy - YUMMY! Hot and sour soup was a big disappointment though. 蔆hef didn't put enough vinegar, salt, and pepper. 蔖lus, the color of the hot and sour soup should have been darker brown too.

Excellent food here. 蔄nd it WILL break your bank, but definitely worth the try. I don't typically like lobster, but the lobster here was excellent. 蔠e also ordered the pea sprouts and house-special beef - both of which were highly recommended by other Yelpers - and they were every bit as good as people said. 蔜he beef was perfectly cooked to a medium/medium-rare, which is very difficult I imagine given how the chunks of beef are generally of different sizes. �I also don't typically rave about Chinese restaurants. 蔅ut yes, this was very very good.

Adhi's guide to a fulfilling dinner at Tan Cang: 1. Make reservation at least three hours before arrival 2. Order a medium size lobster for a party of 4 seafood lover. It will set you bavk around $100 depending on market price. You only need one more dish (large pea tips are well done here) 3. Try the beef loc lac if you're craving some red meat. The tender cubed filet mignons will satisfy your carnivorous appetite. 4. Tip your waiters generously. These guys work their butts off giving quick and excellent service.

I received recommendations to try this place. My cousin told me that this place was listed as the "100 things you must eat before you die". Well, I drove 400 miles down here so I must give it a try. Once I got here, there wasn't any wait cause it was in the afternoon... That's a kudo. Ordered a medium sized house special lobster, honey walnut shrimp and beef with broccoli. They gave us a complementary hot and sour soup to start off with. 15 minutes in and bam!!! What I've been finally waiting for, my kryptonite, my so-called mouthgasm lobster came out on table. I took a piece, slapped it with all that lobster sauce and put it in my mouth. Result: Wahoo!!!!!!!1 By far the best lobster from any Chinese restaurant in California! So much flavor I can't explain. It's just amazingly good!!!!!! Like GOOD! However, it wouldn't be something to die for. lol. It's only 1 of the 100 things you must eat before you die! I guess I have 99 more places to try and I'm glad that I did... They gave us a generous amount of oranges... A second plate of oranges was offered. The service was A++. Either this is what they do regularly or because I had two beautiful girls with me and those horny old Chinese guys were just trying to HOLL@. LOL!

Early dinner with the parental units provided a great chance to eat at Newport Seafood. 蔒rs. C & I have been eyeballing this place for over 2 years, but 蔵t is ALWAYS a mob scene on the weekends, so we have these grand schemes to try it out but have given up on several occasions. 蔍f you come here, just come for the food. 蔍t's cramped and loud inside, and Chinese people aren't exactly known for their proper restaurant/cell phone etiquette. 蔍'm Chinese, so I contribute to Alhambra being Chinese central, but at least I take my cell phone calls outside. The food, tho, is pretty good. 蔜he special lobster comes in a sauce that will have you licking bare lobster shell, it's so good. 蔜he French style beef is a solid version, but Duck House (Monterey Park) has totally ruined me as far as that dish goes. �The shrimp and snow peas were average for me. I'm rating down slightly for a few reasons, however. 蔜here is no question that the kitchen turns out the food quickly - almost too quickly. 蔍t's really hard to pace the food because as you really get to enjoy the lobster (and it does take s small amount of work sometimes) the other dishes arrive and are getting cold. 蔜hat seems like a strange complaint, but try this place and see if it happens. 蔄lso, the parking and the wait can be an ordeal. 蔠e got there at 5:30 on a Sunday evening and waited only 10 minutes, but by the time we left the wait had expanded to what I would estimate to be 45 minutes or more. 蔍 liked the food, but I'm not sure it justifies that long of a wait. The service, however, was shockingly attentive. 蔕ur server memorized the entire order without writing anything down and nailed it. 蔜hey also came by more than once to give us clean plates, since eating lobster also means lots of shell crowding your plate and taking up space. 蔜hey also took our extra food and boxed it up for us, instead of giving us the containers at the table.

Came here for dinner Christmas and the wait was literally 2 hr 1/2. By the time I was done waiting, I had my expectations set so high that if this place wasn't the best place I've ever been.. I would have been upset. And the lobster didn't disappoint at all. But beyond that all the other dishes were just solid. We ordered walnut shrimp, beef cubes, seafood soup, and some type of wrap thing. Avoid the lettuce wrap because they add way too much basil into it so the taste is almost overbearing but all of the other ones are done pretty well. I am tempted to take off two stars instead of one star because of the pricing and the 2 1/2 hour wait. The lobster we ordered came out to be 120 dollars (just the lobster). Pretty ridiculous... I hear the smaller ones run at about 60 dollars and aren't that much smaller.

When it comes to Chinese food, my parents are hard to please. They managed to ruin some of my favorite restaurants I took them to because they find the food too salty or too bland or....

4.5 stars, but can't quite give Newport the boost to make it 5. 蔠hy? 蔅ecause I am still rather annoyed that our party of three asked for the smallest size lobster they had for the night and the waiter told us it'll be 3lb. 蔠e ended up paying $70 itself for a 4.5lb lobster. 蔆OOL. �.5lb more than we expected. 蔔ot very cool. Despite that mishap, Newport is a solid place to get your Chinese seafood fix! 蔍 wish I came here with my family so they could drop serious cash on all the amazing sounding dishes, but with my college student budget, we made due with what we had. We ended up ordering the cheapest set menu (house seafood soup, clams in hot spicy sauce, and chinese broccoli with beef) and the seasonal house special lobster. 蔐obster, AMAZING. 蔆ooked to perfection and so fragrant with so much flavor! 蔍 loved eating the leftover green onions and sauce with rice. 蔜he clams were too spicy for my taste, all I could taste was basil and spiciness; I much prefer clams in the black bean sauce. 蔜he chinese broccoli was good, but greasy and the beef was a little on the tough side. 蔕verall, not super amazing, but great Chinese food nonetheless! 蔜he lobster definitely made up for what lacked in the other dishes. 蔍'm definitely coming back and splurge on the dishes they're known for~ Also, the night I came, there were a good three tables of Chinese guys who were TOO INTO racing each other drinking their beers, which I thought was absolutely absurd. 蔜hey were obnoxiously loud and cheering for each other after somebody would down their glass of beer in ice. 蔕kay. 蔜hat's not that hard of a feat to do, no need to be all loud and obnoxious about it. 蔍 understand you're having fun, but after the million times you do it, I'd think it you all would get tired of it sooner or later, but nope! 蔛igh. 蔒y party kept talking about how we could outdrink those guys. 蔜hey were acting way too hard with their beer-drinking selves. 蔄t least they provided entertainment for us (and a good amount of money for the restaurant).

Long lines. Usual wait is about 1.5 hr. Crazy.. However, the seafood here is super good. Lobster, live shrimp, and clams! Everything tastes so fresh and sweet. The Live Shrimps are huge and have eggs on it. On Choy (Kangkung) here also very tender, not tough and stringy like they are in some restaurants. French Beef here is also better than the Santa Ana Location. Service is fast and efficient (once you get to sit down). One of the places I have to go to when I visit LA.

Worth the drive! 蔠e had House Special Lobster and the beef lac loc and garlic shrimp, plus pea shoots and boba drinks. 蔈verything was terrific. 蔍'm not sure we got an entire lobster tail (definitely got some), and I'm not sure what's up with that, but it was delicious. Even the garnish part of the dish was really good. The shaking beef lac loc was really really good, and the garlic shrimp was also a stand out. 蔜here are long lines and a crazy parking lot, but it's worth the wait! 蔠e'll go back to San Gabriel to try other places now that we know it's worth the drive.

I had the pleasure to finally get to try this place out this past weekend with my family. 蔍 have always heard about this place but living more than 45 minutes away I never had the chance until now and man, I was not disappointed. 蔠e had a party of 8 and came here for lunch so the wait was long but well worth the wait. The fried rice and the beef dishes were a pleasant surprise. 蔜o tell you the truth, the lobster and crab dishes were good but the two beef dishes and fried rices were perhaps the best I have eaten at any Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants which says a lot. I have always used fried rices as an indicator for the overall quality of a Chinese restaurant. 蔍f the rice is too dry it says something about how they make their other dishes. 蔍f its not good rice to eat the next days then I downgrade the place. Newport had the best fried rice dish I have ever had in my entire life while eating it at the restaurant and eating it as a left over the next day. I can't wait to go back again to try some of their other dishes.

One of my favs! French beef, calamari, salt & pepper pork, shrimp, house lobster- get 'em all! This type of cuisine is best enjoyed with a large group so that you can taste everything. Don't expect amazing service however; restaurants like this have waiters that drop off food and then good-luck tracking them down for anything else. But that's the nature of the restaurant; don't take it personal. There are cheaper Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants that serve similar food in the SGV, but Newport gets a lot of customers from different backgrounds, so you don't have to be intimidated about not knowing what to order, or reading the menu etc.

AH! Anytime I'm in the area with my BFF, we try to hit up Newport Seafood... Ohhh Lordy, this place is so good. My favorites? Sauteed Pea Sprouts, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Pork, and of course - Kung Pao Chicken. Actually, scratch that.. ANYTHING you get is going to be delicious. Service is fast, friendly, and straight to the point. The prices are incredibly reasonable, and you will leave with a FULL belly (and only a slightly emptier wallet!). You may need to wait a little for a table, but for a GOOD reason. Uh, parking can be a headache - so be ready to park on the street!

There's already a ton of positive reviews about this place, but it doesn't hurt for one more positive review! The lobster at this place is just kick-ass. A little bit more than what I would like to pay for a dinner, but I'm willing to spend the money once in a while to get some good quality seafood like what they serve here. For food reviews, the other Yelpers have done a pretty good job going through it, so I'll save some energy and make you scroll down to read the other five-star reviews yourself. =]

I haven't been here in a long time. Before it was even this restaurant it was a Marie Callender's. Been meaning to come here and on a spontaneous day my friends decided that we should go. Parking is usually a nightmare when you have a lot of Asians around so if I were you, just park on the street and jaywalk. It's usually a long wait but we went later on in the evening so the wait wasn't that bad. Food is a B+/A and the lobster is awesome. I would recommend that you come with a lot of friends so you can try everything else they offer. Note on a few items: chinese broccoli with beef is good but if you don't eat it right away and have it sit there, it'll start to get dry quick. If you like clams, then the spicy clams are good too, then again my friends couldn't handle the spice but yeah. Service is an A+ and the guys there friendly and kinda funny too. I'll be back eventually! haha

I wish I were more hungry when I came here. I had never heard of this place let alone seen it while driving by, but there seemed to be a general consensus that Newport was 'good expensive Chinese food'. The wait was long, but it seemed to go by quickly. 蔄te in a group of 15 so we got biggest banquet menu offered. I enjoyed the Braided Crab & Fish Maw Soup. Was there really no shark fin in it? The broth of this soup was clear and I took that as a sign that it was bland. Surprisingly, it was super flavorful- even without Hennessey! The Lobster was good but I didn't really try a big piece-- go figure. They were out of crab so gave us a huge plate of shrimp w/ salt+pepper. The Peking style pork chop was sooo salty- BLEH. I liked it the least. Kong Pao Beef/Shrimp/Chicken was normal. Clams w/ spicy sauce was yummy... Service was great. Bill came out to be around $25ish a head since there were so many of us. I would say it's a pretty solid restaurant compared to most but you pay the price for it. Check out the huge crabs in the tank near the front entrance. HUGE!!!

Best Chinese restaurant in San Gabriel Valley hemisphere!!! This place is very popular for its lobsters and crabs, but they are way above what me and my friends can afford, so this review is based on their other "normal" dishes. Located in the busy street of Las Tunas, this restaurant is very crowded on lunch and dinner time, so make sure to go a little early so that the wait won;t be too long. I want to say the parking lot is pretty big, but somehow I always have a hard time to park. Last time I was here, I had some kind of beef dish, one soup, one fried rice, and vegetable. I recalled everything to be very delicious, especially the beef and the soup. I think the beef is dark in color with sweet tangy taste, and the soup is a seafood soup with sweet and sour taste. I wanted to take my parents to go twice, but unfortunately, on both occasion, the place is super crowded that we ended up going somewhere else because my parents do not like to wait too long for food (their loss). Maybe it's a little too early for me to declare this place as a five star that I've only been here once, but I trust fellow Yelpers that's been reviewing this place, and come to a conclusion that this is one of the best place in San Gabriel area.

Let's see I'm from Texas and I travel to LA most of the time just to eat at some amazing restaurants and Newport Seafood is one of them. I would even get the house special lobster to go to take on the plane with me so I can share some with my family because they are all a fan of their house special lobster and crabs. My husband and I can eat 4 pounds of lobster by ourselves and we would also order other dishes as well such as their stir-fry morning glory and bo luc lac.. and clams in ginger sauce.... This place is wonderful. I'm salivating while writing this review because I miss it so much. The waiters/owners are friendly and they are pretty funny too in a good way.

IN EXILE: short, Yelp protest review # 4 of 10 One of the best places to dine for Chinese style seafood in my opinion. The crab and lobster served here are huge but currently out of my price range. I tried the popular French style beef dish: beef loc lac. The beef cubes could have been cooked a little longer and were not of the best quality meat, but I still enjoyed the nice peppery flavor of the dish. The clam dishes are excellent and the sauteed pea sprouts are delicately flavored to my liking. Good service and generous portions. I'm a fan!

While wondering in a car ride we had a bright idea of reminiscing about how much we love Newport Seafood. I had to come back here again just to eat some good food. They really haven't disappointed me at all! This time around we came about 20 minutes before closing and they let us sit down and wrote our order quickly. I like how happy all the waiters are. We ordered the cube beef with pepper sauce and some delicious kung poa chicken. The cube beef had the right amount of seasoning and the beef just melts in your mouth. The chicken was delicious and I love how they put peanuts and onions in it. Way to bump up the flavor in a dish! Yea!! I am a fan and I will be back soon, It beats many places out the door and I am glad they have a awesome following!

I know this place doesn't need any more reviews, but I am a true believer in excellent customer service and I was SO impressed by this place that I will throw in another 5 star review for them. I'll make this short. - delicious food - lunch specials - very good hot and sour soup that comes with lunch specials - clean - nice atmosphere - Chinese restaurant - Chinese restaurant WITH extremely friendly and attentive waiters! I'm pretty sure my aunt and I had a conversation with every server that works here. They all stopped by our table every so often to check on us, swap our plates for new ones, or refill our drinks. But not in that annoying way where your waiter won't go away.... these people were all just genuinely friendly and polite so I didn't mind at all. One of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to.

Great food here! Every time I am in LA, you better believe I will make a stop here for dinner. 蔛o, far everything that I have ordered here is so good. 蔒y favorite is definitely the lobster! It is a must have if you are here. The place is really nice and clean, but it can get pretty crazy in there with a bunch of people running around. 蔜he wait sometimes can get really bad if you go on a Friday or Saturday around dinner time so, be prepare to wait for an hour or longer to be seated. It is pretty pricey, but it's worth it!

This is a great Chinese banquet style restaurant. 蔜heir house lobster is full of black pepper and scallion flavor, and the ginger scallion crab is delicious as well (if a little greasy). �The French style beef loc lac is tasty cubes of beef cooked in a peppery brown sauce. 蔍 liked the house assorted seafood soup -- it feels light and simple, but is packed full of seafood and very flavorful. 蔛teamed rock cod was good.

There's not much I can add to this Yelp. Lobster was just awesome, the restaurant's way of making it is delicious. The steamed fish was light and buttery, so good. Also had the pea sprouts since we saw some tables with this dish, and could not have been happier with this choice. Our primary server was enthusiastic and quick, knew what we had come for and made us feel comfortable. It was only two of us and every item we ordered he said, "The small one yea?" The experience was fun and delicious. All the other waiters were 蔲riendly and attentive as well. Just a great seafood restaurant atmosphere, with the dynamic and open mood of a successful Chinese place. I can see why there are almost a thousand reviews here. Great place.

Hands down one of my favorite restaurants. I will own this place someday, mark my words. My family has been coming here ever since the beginning. I still remember their original location in that small cramped location. I think the senior staff still recognizes us. But enough with that, let's talk about the real reason to come here. LOBSTER Or rather, EVERYTHING SEAFOOD. This is the best place to quench those seafood cravings. For a family gathering, we typically get... - 5-6lb lobster - crispy fried squid with salt and pepper - bo luc lac (shaking filet mignon) - canh chua ca (hot & sour fish soup) - filet fish with basil - shrimp with walnuts - some kind of veggie If you get there around 6-8 on any given day, be prepared to wait about an hour. It slows down after 8pm so if you enjoy later dinners then aim for that time to minimize the wait :) Parking is also a pain as the lot isn't large enough to handle the traffic that it gets. *Pro tip: If the lots are full, park on the street next to the Carl's Jr.

i met up with a few friends today to eat here for the first time. Since it was their suggestion, they ordered the kung pao chicken, oysters with basil sauce, and the filet fish with basil. Everything was rather salty and oily but yummy all the same. I was satisfied, even if it's not exactly "authentic" chinese cooking. I love basil so I was especially happy with the dishes featuring basil or basil sauce. They give you a free bowl of hot and sour soup for each guest and free rice. You get oranges at the end too! Service is fast and efficient. We were brought menus and hot tea as soon as we sat down. Prices are fair for ok to generous portions. There was a small wait when we first got in, but we were seated quickly enough so it was alright. I see a lot of reviews on here about the ACTUAL seafood dishes like crab and lobster, so if I'm ever in the area again, I'll be sure to come here again and try those.

As far as Chinese food goes, it definitely is not one of my favorites. However, this restaurant is an exception. After two visits, I have learned that the food is consistent and the seafood is absolutely yummy. The second time around we got a private room, which was a bonus because it was quieter. Service, on the other hand, is a bit hard to find. Because it is a chinese restaurant, service is usually horrible, so I did not mind it so much. However, in the private room, service was exemplary, but I do not know if that was because we spent more $$. Basically, the dishes included jumbo shrimp, lobster, sweet and sour pork, beef, (amazing) fish, chicken, fried rice, asparagus, other veggies, and so much more that I cannot recall it all. The night ended on fruits including golden kiwis, strawberries, watermelons, and tomatoes. The spices in the seafood dishes were a great complement, and the meats were cooked very nicely to go along with it. All in all, if I ever crave some chinese food (highly unlikely), I will be going back here to dine.

We found out about this place through yelp and as far as I'm concerned, a place with close to 900 reviews and 4.5 stars is worth trying. Wow, ordered a 2 pound crab and 4 pound lobster made with their house style seasoning (Newport Special). When the huge plates came out, they were steaming hot and so tasty and fresh. I frequently eat at Crustacean in Beverly Hills, but that has nothing on this place. Both price wise and taste, this place beats Crustacean hands down. I suggest you visit and judge for yourself.

Not sure why I feel like I have to apologize for liking this place as much as I do... I've been going to Newport Cang since long before they settled into their new digs. I know it's not authentic Chinese - owned and run by a Vietnamese family. �Yes - the lines are intolerably long. �Yes - I've heard all about - outside of the handful of dishes everyone orders - the menu lacks depth (although I wouldn't know as I also order the same dishes as everyone else). But I like this restaurant - a lot - as what they do well - they do extremely well with high quality products. House Special Lobster or Crab are both wonderful - fresh - formidable and well prepared. 蔜his is one of my favorite restaurants to order a large crustacean as their care and preparation are almost flawless. French Style Beef - some of the best I've tasted - large chunks of high grade beef seared to perfection. Shrimp with Walnut - not sure what to think about this dish except to say I thoroughly enjoy it. 蔅ig crunchy jumbo shrimp in a sweet mayonnaise baed sauce with sweet crunchy walnuts - mmmmmmm.... Clams in Blackbean Sauce - some of the best damn clams I've ever eaten. The more upscale dining room is nice. 蔍'm not not sure why Chinese restaurants in America on the whole are not more upscale as they are in London or Berlin - but they should be (I'm not talking to you Wolfgang Puck and that pretentious monstrosity at LA Live I've had the misfortune of not only eating at but paying for...). Overall a very enjoyable if not thoroughly authentic Chinese dining experience - worth the drive and the wait.

I've been dining at Chinese restaurants regularly for as long as I can remember. Growing up, if we weren't eating at home it was either Chinese food, Mexican food or Filipino food 90 percent of the time.. For Chinese food it was Always Chinatown (L.A.) - Hop Li, ABC, Mayflower, Won Kok, or Full House.. Every one of these restaurants had their strong dish, Similarly priced, Most of the time serivice wasn't very pleasant and For the most part, they all 蔴ave the same traditional, not so clean Chinese old world furniture and dining area feel.. Just now, years later, I finally found the combination of Real Authentic Chinese food, in a Sophisticated and Presentable Atmosphere and Service that made feel like we were Emperors from China (exaggerated.. but you get the point). Orders for 5 people (still had some left overs): Newport Special Lobster (seasonal price = 4lb. $64.00): Huge Mound of Lobster parts Covered in that typical Chinese Style Lobster seasoning (Not nearly as much as Mayflower's though, especially the garlic). This sized lobster, I believe is ideal.. (smaller lobsters dont have much meat in them and you really have to dig for the gold / larger lobsters just tend to lose that natural lobster flavor) This had a Nice amount of meat per part, without having to dig for it, most of the time. We went with the mild spice and it definitely wasn't spicy but had a Great flavor incorporated with all the other ingredients. I love Chinese Lobster dishes and of course I Definitely recommend it. I think this dish alone could feed 3-4 average eaters. Clam with Spicy Hot Sauce (and Basil): I usually opt for Clams with black bean sauce but this time their picture (in the menu) made me curious. Typical little tower of clams with a strong aroma of basil and spice. I did ask for mild heat but it the mild was hotter than I expected but it did not linger. These reminded me of a Thai dish. I love clams and I could of probably ordered one of these just for myself! Beef LocLac (French Style): Super tender cubes of Meat (probably a Filet of some sort), on a bed of sliced tomatoes, onions and lettuce. Each cube is almost a mouthful and suprisingly wasn't real chewy. Tasted like a juicy and slightly under seasoned and undercooked steak. This was decent, eating with a piece of onion and tomato made it work a little better for me. Vegetable Deluxe: Medley of chinese brocolli, baby corn, mushroom, bamboo shoots, carrots, onions, green bell pepper, lettuce.. Their sauce brings the life out of every veggie, every bite! Delicious way to take in that fiber! Steamed White Rice: Just like anywhere else, of course this completes a true chinese meal. Hot tea: hot pot on table and little serving cups, again typical but helps washdown all that greasiness! If you want to take someone out that isn't accustomed to Chinatown style dining then this is where I would take them. Besides the Clean and Beautiful decored restaurant and the Excellent Team playing Staff (very courteous, very attentive, a couple different servers swtiched out my 'trash/shell' plate, follow-up orders..), their food is on par with some of the Tastiest Chinese food I've had elsewhere! 蔄 Role Model for all those Chinese Restaurants whom have that cliche of bad service and atmosphere..

This place is seriously my favorite spot for chinese food in all of California. Every time i eat here, i just realize how sucky San Diego chinese food is. I have never seen this place quiet and have never been able to walk in and get a table. But when you see a line of 100 people waiting outside, you know whatever they are serving is going to be worth the wait. prices is soooo affordable too. lobster was about $16 a pound so our 6 lb lobster cost about $100. Totally worth the $100 though. So for those of you like me that uses yelp to figure out what to order. here you go: 1) House Special Lobster (if you dont order this, youre an idiot and just wasting time by making the lines long for no reason) 2) Ong Choy (super refreshing chinese greens that will even out whatever else you have or will order) 3) Clams cooked with basil leaves 4) Steamed Fish 5) Steamed Prawns 6) Seafood Noodles 7) Honey Walnut Shrimp (i use this as a filler cause it is really filling) 8) Bo Luc Lac (basically cubes of grilled steak, ask for salt pepper and limes) so there you have it...the typical 8 course chinese dinner shared among 6-8 people.

I have celebrated MANY occassions here, and it has NEVER disappointed me...US! EVERYTHING is great and the prices are reasonable. Um..hello!? LOBSTER!!!! Their service is great, and they are always willing to take a group picture with as many cameras as you throw at them. They also mess around and say, "say SEXY." LOL Even though it's a drive for us, we are always willing to drive here. 蔠hat sucks is that they don't take reservations, but it's all good..it's worth the wait.

Nice clean Chinese restaurant specializing in seafood. 蔜he place is a good size and seemed popular. 蔠e got a cool table with wooden screen dividers that reminded me of a restaurant in Singapore. 蔍t was a bit over-air conditioned though. �We got a seafood soup and a squid stir-fry. 蔜here was a lot of vegetable in both dishes, which was good but maybe could have used more seafoods? �The taste of the food was pretty good but not too flavorful. 蔒aybe we just didn't know how to order. 蔜he servers were friendly, especially for a Chinese restaurant. 蔍 would like to return sometime and maybe try a fish or a lobster.

It's absolutely mind boggling how hyped Tan Cang is. I'm quick to admit it: I was a sucker for its hoopla. I've passed by the place so many times seeing how insanely busy it always is. Naturally, my curiosity was piqued. And, when I saw the 4.5-star Yelp rating, the curiosity thing just got the better of me...with hope that it'd be something spectacular and unique that I've yet had the pleasure to experience. ���Man, was I ever more letdown and duped in my life! The food at Tan Cang is seriously just some mediocre Cantonese fare masqueraded 蕎ith some Chiu Chow influence and/or Vietnamese twist. �In all fairness, their signature lobster is not bad; and, its rich, bold taste is a little different than the HK Cantonese variety. But, it just ain't that special -- especially at $15/lb. Most HK Cantonese restaurants charge 1/3 of that. NBC Seafood (a mediocre HK Cantonese restaurant) can whip up a better lobster dish than Cang Tang! Seriously people -- 4.5 stars??!! 蔠TF!! To top it all off (never mind the one-hour wait), Cang Tang is a total rip off. I ordered 6 dishes for my party, and the check came out to be over $235, including tips. Granted, the service at Tan Can is a tad better than most Chinese restaurants. �Anyway, I have a feeling that if you're reading this, you'll probably still want to check out Tan Cang because of the Yelp frenzy and the crazy amount of people you see waiting outside. That's understandable but frankly, these are sheople that just don't know any better! And yes, I was a sucker, but I'm writing this to warn you, so that you won't be one.

I guess we should have ordered the lobster. I didn't know this until I read some reviews. Anyway, we came here on a Sat afternoon for lunch with my family. We ordered 5 plates and everything was okay. 3 shrimp dishes, a chicken dish and seafood fried rice. The prices were very reasonable, but I was expecting something more.

After reading 766 reviews on yelp and being sort of in the neighborhood.. we decided to give them a try. I would actually suggest going with a nice group of people, so you can order a lot and try a lot of dishes. We were two so we had a french style beef (it sounds weird right?, french?) It was really delicious. We also had the clams with basil and a fried rice. The bill was only 29.00 plus tip. So cheap for the amount of food you get. We got lucky to get a parking spot at their lot. Service was ok, sometimes it felt a little rushed. I would go back to try their lobster.

I think the tag of "best Chinese food" is a stretch, because it wasn't that great. Yes, the lobster is good, but other places serve lobster like this too! (Plus, I'm more of a crab fan myself). Regardless, we had the French style beef, which was great, along with the clams with basil and lettuce wraps (or what I like to think of as "lettuce tacos"). The clams had way too much sauce on it and had a weird taste, and honestly I prefer the lettuce wraps that 蔭re accompanied with the hoisin sauce. This one had a weird Thai flavor to it that I've never had before at a Chinese restaurant. Not sure I would wait an hour for this place again when there are other great Chinese restaurants nearby.

When it gets cold it was not as good The clams were ok The geo duck sashimi tasted kinda sweet The beef cubes were xcellent The tong Choy was ok. The catfish soup was nohing out of the ordinary The service was good too even though it was very busy the waiters got it down I will return and get the king crab next..

Favorite seafood restaurant! There is ALWAYS a wait but you can request a private section (not exactly a room) for small private parties. It's a fusion between chinese and vietnamese food. The best 4 dishes/ MUST GET are: 1. Lobster in the house special sauce: HUGE portions, soft meat, great flavor/taste 2. Crab in garlic/green onion or salt and pepper: you can request half of it to be cooked in one sauce and the other half to be cooked in some different sauce you see in the menu 3. Fish- MUST get half and half again: their house special sauce here is AMAZING and it is a MUST try. (it's a little sweet/salty and fried on the outside) and the other half you can get it just steamed like usual with ginger. 4. Clams- with basil - im drooling right now. it is so good. SO GOOD 5. Meat- filet in something like a black bean sauce. i forgot but the meat is SO tender and delicious. I wish I could eat here all the time. They have the biggest crabs you've ever seen and they can go up to $400. I highly recommend this place. Food is A+, service is A+.

I don't have any friends that don't like this place. 蔊ood place for family style Chinese/Vietnamese seafood restaurant and celebrations. 蔞ery accommodating for birthdays (they actually sang and helped us cut cake). 蔜he waiters are nice there even though sometimes they forget things (probably busy) like our beer. �But they are attentive once you get their attention. We ordered (and liked them all): Small Lobster soup (enough for one small bowl per person) House special lobster (got 2 medium lobsters to share with a group of 8) Bo Luc Lac (French Filet mignon cubes) & onions Steamed Cod Walnut shrimp Kung Pao Chicken When we got the bill (which wasn't exactly cheap), we were surprised they charge for steamed rice (per person) too. 蔍 guess a lot of places do that now. �Parking is not so great on busy nights. 蔜hey even do stacked parking. 蔜he wait can be long if it's also a busy night. �Lucky for us, it wasn't since we started dinner a bit later.

This place was so good it made me sign up for a Yelp account. After not seeing my parents for over a year, I took them to this restaurant (based on a few different friends' endorsements) to share a nice meal with me. We ordered the house signature lobster dish, steamed rock cod, giant shrimp (just straight boiled in water) and a garlic sauteed vegetable dish. 蔈verything was cooked to perfection. 蔒y parents both commented on how perfect the timing and heat must've been on the fish, shrimp and vegetable dishes to get it to taste distinctively better than so many other restaurants we've ate at back in New York where I'm from (and there are many great Chinese seafood restaurants in NY that we frequent). The lobster was just something else. 蔍t wasn't traditionally Chinese like the other 3 dishes we ordered, but eating it was an experience into a new level of flavor for my taste buds. 蔎ust amazing. 蔍'm looking forward to making fried rice with the leftover scallion and pepper seasoning. 蔣UM! Price was high (came out to $210 for the 3 of us after tip and tax), but ultimately, between the amazing food, good decor and nice servers, it was well worth it.

Their parking lot is full on weekends: It's that annoying yet telling signal that a place is most probably popular, delicious, and a great value. It definitely holds true for Tan Cang. An SGV standby for authentic Chinese food. The smell of Basil wafts past the vast dining hall - past the 4 person booths and family-style roundtables with lazy Susans serenely awaiting a spin. A generally casual ambiance with private rooms in the back for perhaps a more austere or maybe more raucous - but either way- celebratory dinner. That's the interesting thing about Tan Cang, it's at the same time casual and a value option as well as a place to go post graduation or for a farewell/welcome home dinner replete with $$$ lobster, giant crab legs, or whole fish. My favorite time to go is on Sundays around 1pm for the lunch specials. Sometimes the wait is a bit long, but worth it - plus it gives me time to ht up the mini-Mitsuwa nearby for a makeshift appetizer or two. You just can't go wrong with the basil clams or the basil fish fillet. If you're a chicken chow fun fan like me, they have a large portion with a lot of sauce & bok Chou. I've had a number of other tasty dishes with the only near miss being the BBQ pork chop. In a town where Asian food's authenticity is essentially guaranteed, Tan Cang ups the ante with it's nuanced basil sauces and exceptional fresh seafood dishes. And relative to other SGV Chinese restaurants where (Western style) service is either non-existent or intensely robotic, Tan Cang's waitstaff often add a touch of amiability to the dining experience, which makes their exotic dishes all the more easy to digest.

Let's cut to the chase...the best part of the visit was the lobster. 蔠e had the the salt and pepper lobster with some chinese broccoli, squid and kung pao chicken. 蔜he dishes are all so flavorful, but not the salty type. 蔄nd none of it was served as if you were in a Chinese take out type of place. Parking can be difficult especially on the weekends in the lot, but you should be able to find ample street parking. 蔜he interior of the restaurant is new and modern, considering this was an old Marie Callendar's back in the day. I recommend this place - great for large groups. You can always share those large dishes...if you want, i guess.

4.5 stars rounded down because it was pretty pricey.. Our group of 6 had a medium sized house special lobster, the house special fish, hot and sour soup for the white boy, yam leaf vegetable course, and the french style beef cubes. Lobster, of course, was the highlight of our meal and was amazing. My breath reeked of garlic for the whole week after, but i didnt mind. House Fish: I dont know what kinda fish it was but they used their house sauce which was kind of a sweet and sour tasting sauce. This was pretty good, but I dont think I would order it again. French style beef cubes: MUST get, small portion for its price but this and the lobster were the highlights of the table. Yam leaf vegetable course: YUM! Although it was drenched in oil, it was really good and had nice garlic chunks that were yummy to eat. Hot and sour soup: only ordered this cuz one of our friends was caucasian and he craves this; this was mediocre and tasted just like any other restaurant's. my mom told me to get the durian shake but my friends refused to let me.. so try it for me!

Our party was a table of six adults and we ordered the $48 set which was a GREAT VALUE! 蔜he set included: 1. 蔆atfish hot and sour soup (It has pineapple chunks in it and reminds me of Thai style soup) = 5 stars 2. 蔖ea sprouts = 4 stars 3. 蔏ung pao chicken = 4 stars 4. 蔛teamed whole fish (The portion only fed 4-5 people) = 4 stars 5. 蔆lam with spicy hot sauce = 5 stars We also ordered a small house special lobster at market price (not sure what that was), not sure if the dinner set above with this lobster would be enough food for all six of us. �House special lobster (I would like to try another style lobster next time around and maybe I'll like it more) = 4 stars Sure enough, what we ordered was JUST RIGHT for our party. Complimentary orange slices to wrap up your meal and the restaurant has nice modern decor. Tip: Find street parking; Don't bother with the parking lot during peak hours.

Heard many great reviews from friends, and decided to go for lunch. Pulled into the parking lot at 12:10p and it was full. Lunch specials run for approximately $7 each. I ordered: Stir Fried Beef with Rice Noodle Filet with Basil Really enjoyed the FILET WITH BASIL. Lots of fish, and instead of stir frying it and throwing it on a plate like most Chinese restaurants, they actually took the time to roll it with batter, deep frying it a little before stir frying it with the basil. Was absolutely wonderful. Lunch special comes with complimentary soup & rice. Not a bad choice for a lunch if you are ordering off their lunch menu, but good luck beating the lunch crowd if you only have a 1-hour lunch. Restaurant is nice and clean. Staff are friendly and attentive, but sometimes slow to respond since they are overwhelmed by the lunch crowd. *NOTE* If you know you will be coming here with a big party and already confirmed the time, you might want to call in advance for a reservation. I have heard from some people that they do not take reservations, but I personally called and successfully made a reservation before. I guess it depends on which day, how big is your party or who picks up your call. Good luck.

We got: "West Lake" Beef Sticky Soup (one of the most uncommon "West Lake" soups I've had. 蔳enerally the beef is minced, and there's usually (at least in my experience) carrots or tomatoes in the soup, but there was in here, and you know what? 蔵t worked) House Special Lobster (excellent dish, nice spiciness, on par with the Lobster at Full House in Arcadia) Clams with Spicy Hot Sauce (large, tasty clams) Beef Loc Lac (French Style - good, but comparable to many other places) Ong Choy (aka Water Spinach - the green stalky veggies with a hollow center, kinda like a flattened straw - fresh, nicely cooked) I'm not sure what style of cuisine this really is. 蔄s many items don't seem super traditional. 蔒ore of a vietnamese bent. The gf was slightly worried b/c everything we ordered had this pepper sign next to it. 蔈verything was fine though, cuz you know what?

My coworker asked me for a suggestion on restaurant we should eat for lunch and I thought of this place. It is a place that I have always wanted to try especially with the high ratings on Yelp. I have to say that this place is good, but not a five star restaurant by any means. During lunch time, they have a special lunch menu. We had the fish fillet, the chinese broccoli and beef, and last we had the salty shrimp. I think the salty shrimp was our least favorite because it was so messy to eat. The other two dishes were better but I think the chinese broccoli was the best one. Also, for lunch, they provide a soup and some rice. Overall, this place was a good deal for the quality of food.

Came here on a Sunday around noontime. At the time there was about a 15 minute wait as the place was packed. We ordered the Small Newport Lobster, Crispy Fried Squid with salt and pepper. french style fillet Mignon and house special fried rice. Fried Squid with salt and pepper: It was a bit over fried so it became a bit too oily but all in all it was pretty good. French style fillet Mignon: small portion, tender and very well flavored; would recommend it as a meat dish. House special fried rice: good fried rice Newport Lobster: So we ordered the small however it was still pretty large. Lobster was about 18 dollars a pound so our 5 pound lobster came out to be about 90 dollars. The way it was cooked was delicious. Usually when I eat lobster I enjoy it with ginger and green onion, however I definitely recommend trying this out. I really wanted to try other things they had such as their steamed fish, clams and crab, however, the girlfriend felt we ordered too much already (: The total bill came out to be 140 with tax and tip, but well worth it. One recommendation I have is to come here in a big group, order a lot of dishes and try everything. This is about as good as it gets, can't wait to go back!

Been coming here with my parents for years, we use to go when they were in a smaller location down the street. Their food has always been great especially the lobster however, the last few times we have gone they seem to disappoint us every time. Last Friday, we went and was seated right away since we were a small table. We had ordered the set dinner and a lobster on the side. The food came out quick which is great however, the order that our food came out made it hard to enjoy our meal. The lobster was the very first thing that came out. Usually the soup is the first to come out and then the dishes follow. The soup was the second to last thing that came out and I was almost full by the time it was here. My next complaint is that the lobster was not as good as it has been before. Usually this ordered the sauce is amazing and makes me want to have a bowl of rice just with the sauce alone. However, this night the sauce was water downed making it hard to enjoy the lobster.

One of my favorite restaurants for family get-togethers and birthdays :) Just came here this afternoon at 1, during their lunch special - it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. They start you off with a soup on the house and the prices range around 6.95 per plate - not bad at all for a lunch special. The waiters here are very comical, they know how to make a group laugh. From the 4 times I've been there, the food always comes out quick and never ceases to satisfy! Order the French Beef - tiny filet mignon cuts - it's realllly good and tender. Their Pan-Fried Noodles are the tastiest I've ever had, and their Taro smoothie is really delicious. Their seafood is great (it is a seafood restaurant). Their house special lobster and crab are musts, and the clam with basil is pretty good, too. Love this place!

Amazing! The wait was insane, but now I know why. The House Special lobster certainly lives up to the hype. Some of the best I've ever tasted anywhere, and I've had my share. The Filet Mignon was incredibly tender and flavorful. I am still thinking about this meal. Definitely worth a visit!

OK i take back what i said before about this place not being as good as its diamond bar cousin. blown away, yet again, last night by the quality and taste of the food. i LOVE this chain! Food to get: 1) Lobster 蕁ewport special style. it's famous for a reason. try it. worth every celebratory penny. 2) Bo Luc Lac (filet mignon cubes): so tender and juicy. perfectly cooked and seasoned. one of the best i've ever had, and im viet! 3) Cang Chua Ca (Catfish sweet and sour soup): this was also really well done. flavors were just like my grandma used to make. fish was good. 4) Kung pao pork chop: my new favorite dish here! sauce was SO GOOD and the cut of the meat was quality, not leftovers-side-meat tasting like u get at many places. 5) Deep fried tofu with soy and green oinion, jalepenos: MY FAVORITE DISH HERE, always. the tofu is so soft and fried delicately, so that it comes out warm, fresh, with just enough jiggle to make you jiggle. 6) whole fish in sauce: also amazing. the fish was tender nad firm, the sauce hit just right. amazing for late nights with friends, family dinners, or any time you want a great great meal at an affordable price.

I ordered the Beef Luc Lac and it was delicious. The meat was so tender and the onions added the perfect amount of spice. I wish they gave more than four slices of tomatoes and the lettuce was chopped up, but I can't complain. The dish was good.

Wow, definitely don't come here with picky eaters or vegetarians especially if you're going to do the prefixe meal. � courses. 蔍 went for a friend's birthday and his girlfriend was raving about this place for MONTHS and MONTHS before I finally went (in the mean time they went like, 4 times) 蔐et me just say...it lived up to the hype. 蔠e had a huge birthday entourage but they sat us down in a table where there was enough room for the people but hardly any room for the food! We ordered the 9 course but we also added a few others dishes. �In the end the things that really stayed in my mind was the fish, the crab and the lobster. 蔍 personally like the salt and pepper crab the best, especially the guts in the head! 蔠e also ordered some duck and other veggie dishes but for some reason the duck wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Best salt n pepper crab I've had in socal, I can't wait to come back again for someone's birthday..maybe mine and feast again!

I had Hunnie's surprise birthday dinner here back in March we ordered so much food and I can't remember everything we order. So, I'm just going to review some of the stuff we ordered * lobster- delicious!! No wonder they are known for their lobster! =) * walnut shrimp- too much mayo for my taste but everyone else seemed to love it * clams- loved it! * service- they were great! 蔍 came after work to try to reserve tables but they don't take reservations. But the staff was more than happy to assist me in setting everything up and advised what time I should have someone be there to put their name down so we will be able to have our table at my desired time. 蔛uper friendly and also funny. 蔜hey were so amused with the Lambo cake I got hunnie they kept asking about it. And I don't blame them, the cake (which I ordered from my friend Emily at Gem cakes, find them on facebook! ) looked AMAZING!! I'll be seeing you guys again very soon!

The lobster an the crab dishes are okay. It's either over seasoned and sauced excessively or under seasoned. But again it doesn't taste bad. I still have had better dishes in my area.

Good place for seafood..but i'm not really a seafood person so I usually eat the meat and stuff. :) the lobsters r expensive but flavorful. If they lower the price for the lobster, then this place will be a 5! hehehe Very pricey menu but i think the portions r good. the service is slow..but then again, they're pretty busy. parking is a bizzy.. :(

I've been coming here for years (even back when the restaurant was at its old San Gabriel location next to Golden Deli). Any long drive or long wait you have to endure to eat at Newport is well justified. The food is fantastic and the flavors are probably different than the typical flavors you would find at a Chinese seafood restaurant. Newport serves Chinese food with Southeast Asian influences. As everyone else has noted, the lobster is a must. But some other things to try are: - Braided Crab Meat & Fish Maw Soup - Newport Special Crab (this can be very expensive, more so than the Lobster, but it was so good) - Clam with Black Bean Sauce - Elephant Clam (Geoduck) 2 styles (my favorite)

This house is always crowded. 蔜heir speciality? 蔉resh lobster cooked with chili peppers and green onions. 蔞ery flavorful. 蔒y family always comes here for special occasions. 蔜he food is served family style. We had... 1. 蔇eep fried tofu (very delicately flavored and incredibly soft pieces of tofu coated with a golden yellow, slight crispy, slightly chewy coating and served with a soy dipping sauce - they do it pretty well here 2. Clams with black bean sauce - their clams are high quality and black bean sauce might be a bit salty for some, but I find it tasty 3. 蔕ne green veggie - say pea sprouts (or spinach) sauteed with garlic Highly recommend!

What's better than getting a large order of crabs? Probably getting a larger order of medication to cure those nights of accidental indiscretions that only a spoonful of daddy issues can cause. Don't worry, I'm sure it was their first time too. The next best cure would be a visit to Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant. Don't worry about the long name, Newport Tan Cang Cook! As you walk into the Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant, you're kindly greeted by a dozen portly King Crab hosts that beckon invitation...to eat them. Be wary though, these Monarchs of Crab don't put out cheaply...27.99 a lb to be exact. At an average of 6 lbs, Secret Santa budget Christmas sounds much more economical after feasting on these Titans of Shell. There's always two good measures of a Chinese restaurant, the wait and the amount of Asians eating in them. Newport had plenty of both, so I felt slightly comforted when the hostess asked me if I wanted to order anything to prepare before we got seated. If you look around the walls, publications like Westways and LA Weekly line the area with positive reviews. Of course, these aren't as reputable as Yelp reviews that contribute only the minimum amount of information needed. Who needs the entire full name of the writer anyways? Carlo C. reviewed that! And he said the water was savory. Enough said... Things you have to try: Spicy Lobster: It's their signature dish and their logo. 16.99/ lb and your soul, now devoted to this restaurant. King Crab: Just message me if you're treating. Basil Fish: Fresh Basil, Fresh Fish...make you very satisfied Beef Loc Lac: Filet Mignon Cubes served with onions and tomatoes. Made in a French Vietnamese way which means that its a cross between Pho and a reluctance to stop Nuclear arms testing.

I came here because Jonathon Gold considers this currently one of his 99 Essential Restaurants in LA and decided with all the Yelp reviews to boot, I need to give this a try. Came here around 4pm on a Sunday and already the parking lot was pretty crowded. Still didn't have to wait for a table though although the table we got seated at was so large, my girlfriend might as well have been in Chinatown instead of the SGV. The whole decor and layout of the place reminded me of a Denny's or a Norm's instead of a Chinese restaurant. The people sitting at the booths by the windows might as well having been ordering a Bigger Better Grand Slam Breakfast and some pie rather than some Seafood Fried Rice. Interesting to note that we got served a large container of white rice immediately upon seating. Just like getting bread upon seating at Italian restaurant. So in my case, I had both rice and noodles for my dinner. Actually, we still got to order from the luncheon menu so we got some pretty large entrees and still spent less than twenty bucks on the entire bill. I had the Seafood Fried Noodles which was ridiculously large with a lot of seafood (especially squid) and a ton of fried noodles. I should've ordered the rice noodle but I always seem to end up with the fried stuff instead and it never completely gets immersed in the marinade. The taste was very thick and somewhat sweet. Marinade taste seemed to last in my mouth for a long time. My girlfriend ordered the Garlic Shrimp which was listed as being spicy but she noted it wasn't that spicy. I guess if you really want spicy cuisine in San Gabriel, you go to a place like Chung King instead. We both got server Hot and Sour Soup as well. I would say prior to our entree but we actually got the Shrimp dish first, then the soups and then the Noddle dish. Soup itself was very thick with good flavor although I was disappointed not to see a wonton soup on the menu. Which is my personal favorite. Service itself seemed rushed. Waiter kept coming over asking 'Order Now?!'. Hey, it's our first time and we don't know what we want that fast! Give us some time! I know a lot of people here on Yelp say the service was friendly but we didn't think that was the case. Not totally rude but definitely out of the ordinary. Nice and healthy touch for dessert was we were served orange slices instead of the usual fortune cookies you normally see at a Chinese restaurant. Nice touch and we both appreciated it. Maybe this is because it's not some Amercianized Chinese joint but either way, we approve. I know. We didn't order the lobster and if we ever go back we might just do that but this trip we wanted to stick with the standards and while Newport Seafood was good, I wouldn't call this establishment an 'essential' on our list. Especially with the nearly hour long drive to get here.

went for lunch great low cost lunch items. had clams + fried shrimp lunch menu. with rice + soup. total came out to be under 15$. we wanted to try out the market priced lobster but did not get to since only ones they had left were over 5 lbs. which was too big for lunch. will definitely try the lobster next time. you get the traditional chinese sour soup (which I absolutely don't like in most places) 蔭nd it was actually good. I actually finished my soup for the first time ever. based on the quality of ingredients this is no "ghetto-cheap= good " chinese food and they make excellent food. the environment was not super luxurious but clean. our waiter was attentive and patient (this was our first visit and took a while to decide on what to eat) the portions may be slightly small for some people with big appetite but overall I thought it was good size. This was one of very few chinese places where I actually ate food and feeling good inside of the stomach without being sleepy with post-MSG indulgence. it's that "clean" in my opinion. will go back for sure!

Two five-star reviews from one weekend: that's a damn fine weekend in the San Gabriel Valley. Get ready for a fish frenzy. It's affordable, too (it was for us, at least, and that may have something to do with avoiding the "market price" items). We got way to much food--chicken & cashews, oysters in black bean sauce, hong kong style rice noodles, fried squid (2 or 3 dishes should be 100% adequate for 2 people), and 2 beers for under $55--that is a bargain for that much food. Almost slipped into 4-star territory for the ambience, which consists of screaming brats running in circles around the dining/waiting area, running into people, bumping into servers carrying trays and drinks, etc. Good people watching if you enjoy watching horrendous parenting. Try it and enjoy; yet again, this place lives up to its own Yelp-hype.

Newport doesn't really need another 5 star review, but they definitely deserve another one. My family from San Francisco arrived in Monterey Park at about 6:00PM on a Wenesday night. I didn't think there would be a long wait since it was a week night, so we hung out at the house for a bit until everyone got hungry. 7:30 rolls around and everyone is now hungry, so we head over to the restaurant. My initial thought when we arrived - "Woah, there are hella people waiting!!" I hurriedly got out of a car to get a number and was told the wait would be 45 minutes. Keep in mind this is a Wednesday night at 8:00PM, and the wait was still 45 minutes long. 30-40 minutes later, our number was called. I love it when I get seated sooner than expected, so already that's plus 1 star for me. We ordered the fish maw and crab meat soup, the lobster, deep fried tofu, beef loc lac, clams, and a few other staple Chinese dishes. �Ten minutes after placing our order, the waiter came back to let us know that they had ran out of clams, so we decided to go with the lettuce wrap instead. All the reviews in here about the lobster are true - it did not dissapoint. The lobster isn't like the ginger and scallion ones at typical Chinese restaurants. They use a lot of seasoning and pepper, so it's very flavorful. That's another star for holding up to it's hype. The deep fried tofu is very crispy on the outside and silky smooth on the inside. Keep in mind that because these are deep fried, they won't taste as good the next day, so it's best to finish it at the restaurant. Our waiter suggested we get the beef loc lac and I remembered seeing this item in the highlights on yelp - I guess because it's another one of their more popular dishes. It's their version of the filet mignon beef cubes - very tender and flavorful as well. Another star for a good recommendation. Throughout our meal, our waiter kept checking up on us to make sure we were happy with the food. 蔛o on top of great food, this place has great customer service as well. 蔜hat's definitely another star in my books. But...we were still missing the lettuce wrap and we were almost done with dinner already, so we asked him to cancel the order. Five minutes later, another waiter brings the lettuce wrap. "Uh...we cancelled the order" I told him. He looked a little confused and walked away with the dish. 蔕ur waiter came back with the dish and said that there was a mix up and the dish was on the house since it never got cancelled. 蔄nd there you go - the fifth star for holding up to their mistakes and doing something to correct it. Great food, great service - 蕋hat's as good as it gets!

Yeah the local favorite spots to go to that are good and still medium affordable. If you're paying $8+ a big dish per Chinese dinner dish, then you might as well get it here. New decor and great chinese food. Pretty much most of their items are delicious. We even tried dishes we thought they didn't specialize it, and surprising still good.... so I haven't gotten one bad dish here so far. Parking is difficult and don't make any lethal moves to park in another restaurant's parking lot. YOU WILL GET TOWED! I seen so far 3 tows I've been back to this place, sad to see but read the reviews! Walk the distance or get picked up/carpool! Can't go wrong with this place. I think it even pleases tourist taste buds. French beer is the watering hold favorites of those that come here. 蔐arger than the norm bottles just fyi. If you can come with great, thats great! Family style where the more people the more items you can get to shared, especially a big house crab! or Lobster!

Michael is to Newport Tan Cang as... A) Oil is to water B) Charlie Sheen is to after week long benders C) Gaga is to Plain Jane D) Asians are to Yelp While some of you may try make a claim for D, the the correct answer is B cause like Mister Sheen, I too can't go very long without a (food) bender to keep me sane. 蔕nly difference is Charlie's winning ways could lead to an STD, jail time, rehab, and/or death. 蔄s for me the worst thing that can happen to me is a little food coma and an overstuffed belly. 蔒aybe adult onset diabetes but who's counting... Bad analogy, but all kidding aside the food at Newport Tan Cang is damn good. 蔒y faves include the steamed fish with basil, sauteed pea sprouts, salt and pepper shrimp, shaking beef, and my all time fave mapo tofu over steamed white rice. So just like I did for Obama in 08, I give my full endorsement to Newport Tan Cang and recommend that you do too. 蔒ake sure to order everything I mentioned above and maybe throw in an order of their famed lobster, which is pretty much on every table. I haven't had it myself but I hear its the main reason this place is packed every weekend. And for all you cheap skates out there NTC is super affordable. 蔜hey have sick lunch specials ($5-$7 per order) that run though 4pm every day, including weekends. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me, not to mention that your hard earned money will go a long way here. �Overall I would say that this place is a must if you're craving some awesome food at a great price. 蔔TC is a cut above your average Chinese restaurant, and while they're not going to roll the red carpet out for you, you can definitely expect to always have hot tea, cold water, and a full pot steamed rice at all times. �APPROVED!

Save yourself that $1000 plane ticket 蕋o China because.... seriously, this place is SWARMING with chinese folks. I tried looking for the maximum capacity sign somewhere to see if it was legal for that many people to be in the restaurant all at once.... but I couldn't seem to find it... (I bet they hid it cleverly so they wouldn't get in trouble!) **Word of Advice: Call ahead and you can get a number to save your spot in line. But even doing this, we waited about 20 minutes. However, that beats the normal hour or two of standing in there packed like sardines!! ALSO, their LOBSTER and french styled beef are TO DIE FOR! My mouth just salivated thinking about those yummy yummy flavors bursting in my mouth. The lobster isn't just any lobster. It's cooked in whole bunch of delicious spices and jalapenos. (HINT: Mix the lobster spices with your rice in the bowl, and it tastes like yummy fried rice!!) Their french styled beef is SUPERRR tender. (HINT: Squirt the juice from the lime slice INTO that tiny saucer with pepper-looking paste (it's actually fish paste) and then you mix it with your chopstick to create the sauce. My uncle didn't know this and actually ended up putting the entire lime slice into his water cup -__-) Anyways, dipping that moist and delicious beef into that tangy, lime sauce ..is...just... omg, my mouth is watering AGAAIIN!! We also ordered walnut shrimp, sauteed pea sprouts, mint & basil clams, and rex sole. They were all SUPER yummyyy. You can't go wrong with ANY dish... really! You can probably even try blindfolding yourself and pinpointing a random entree with your pointer finger, and you'll STILL order something epic. So if you love yourself, make a visit to newport!! :)

If "Seafood" is part of the restaurant title, they better serve up some amazing seafood. Newport Seafood Restaurant, you did not disappoint. Not only is this place very chic and modern, but your dishes are wonderful. The lobster is a must have, as well as the clams with black bean sauce. They deserve 5 stars. Everything was very fresh and tasted great, but only deserved 4 stars in my book. Service was decent BUUT the chairs!!! Ugh, they were dirty and old with stains. Some chairs were sticky. I don't understand how they can create such a great atmosphere with chandeliers over some booths and these wonderful partitions between some tables, yet they can't afford new chairs. I'm baffled.

As far as chinese food goes, I prefer this place better than 888. The service is impeccable and the wait was not that long. However, parking is a huge issue here, but their food and service made up for that quite quickly. I opted to get their garlic string beans with the house special lobster. Yes lobster. I got fancy that day. Give me a break. Oh how I did not regret getting that lobster. It was all parts, sweet, succulent, flavorful and NOT greasy whatsoever. I requested the smallest lobster they had and still managed to get a 2.5 pounder. I swear, my eyes were crying because they even saw how good that lobster was. Go here. That's not even an option.

This is where all the Asian doctors take their hot dates. I would know -- this is where my doctor takes me, haha! I'm not exactly sure if it was him or the seafood but we've been together ever since. ;) The seafood is terrific here. Even the vegetables are extraordinarily good (my favorite is the dou miao) Lobster, crab, fish mao soup... Can't go wrong. They also have nice back rooms for private parties and intimate side booths with pillows and cushions. Classy Chinese in the middle of Asian Los Angeles. The only reason I'm promoting this already over populated restaurant is because we don't have to wait in line. You however, might want to make reservations in advance. Trust me- it's worth it.

Came here on a weeknight and there wasn't much of a wait - walked right in and got seated. 蔍 wanted to order the house special lobster but my friends were feeling cheap that night and didn't want to spend much.

The place is a bit pricey for what you can get elsewhere like New Capital down the street. 蔅ut, what we did get was really good. 蔠e got the sizzling seafood plate, and the shrimp fried rice was delicious. 蔍 will go back and try the lobster because it looked absolutely fantastic!

House special lobster is the best, with ong choy stir fry. When you are craving for lobster, go for Newport. Their house special lobster is one of the best in the country. It's the hot item. Sometimes you can even get lobster eggs too. They used to be in a smaller strip mall, smaller place but very crowded. They had moved few years back to a different place. Better looking and more friendlier. If you eat lobster, expect to spend about $100 for party of 3. The more people will cost you less in average....

What can I say that hasn't already been said? 蔒y fam came here with my DF's fam for their first meet and greet. 蔄 bit awkward, but the wonderful food took off the edge. The most memorable dishes are: 1. Lobster. 蔍f I could be the mermaid in Splash and eat the shell, I would. 蔜he crust on the outside is where all the delicious flavor lies. 蔒y medium sized crustacean buddy is deep fried, tossed in some magic sauce with spring onions and TONS of garlic, and served chopped in pieces. 蔈very bite rendered a bit of greasy oil to drip down my fingers, over my palms, and down my chin. 蔍 know I shouldn't have, but I bit off quite a bit of the crust on the shell. 蔍 relived eating the lobster with each subsequent burp well into the next day. 蔒mn, so delicious yet so gross. 2. The Shrimp Salad. 蔍t's basically a deconstructed spring roll without the rice paper. 蔜he lettuce, shrimp, peanuts, bean sprouts, and mint leaves are tossed in a slightly spicy fish sauce dressing. 蔍t's tangy, tart, and super delicious. 蔍t was a light accoutrement to the heavy, oily, delectably sweet and garlicky lobster. 3. Salt and Pepper Squid. 蔜he meat is chewy, tender, and soft while the batter is extremely light. �4. French Cubed Filet Mignon. 蔜he meat is very tender, peppery, chewy, and delicately sweet. 蔜he sweet offsets the heat of the pepper and it goes great on a bed of steaming, soft, pillowy, white rice. It's always a pleasure to eat here, but a pain in the ass to park and wait for a seat. 蔜he best time to come is 6-6:30PM.

Previously, my very best lobster experiences have been 3000 miles east .Simple prep. steamed preferably , over anything the least bit more complicated. 蔔ewport has changed my lobster outlook. Succulent juicy and deeply flavorful, boosting without masking the delicate lobster meat . It;s a hands on, 蔰ripping to the elbows endeavor. When the menu says "market price" I am usually prepared for the worst, but here you can have yourself a guilt free Lucullen feast for what you would spend on a very medicre meal elsewhere. The other dishes vary from good to very good though none stand out as loudly in my memory as the big red beast at the center of the table, Ambience -nice but who cares.

Sweet Lord Almighty. If Barry Bonds were a crustacean, he'd be served on a platter here at Newport Seafood. Dam, those lobsters have to be the most roided up shellfish I've ever seen....they sure are tasty though. Just as importantly though, is how well Newport cuts and presents their lobster. I'm one of those Chinese Americans who is fine eating lobster when the parents order and pay for it but am usually too cheap and lazy to eat it when out with my own friends. But Newport cuts it in a way that makes the meat more accessible and easy to reach. Thanks. The most obscene display of overeating I've ever witnessed in person, let alone participated in, happened in the summer of 2010 for my friend David Wong's bachelor party. Holy mother... TWO lobsters, TWO Gong bao chicken cube platers. TWO orders of clams, TWO orders of the filet mignon cubes, TWO orders of shrimp with walnuts, TWO orders of the cut fish fillets...for 8 of us. If you've eaten here, you know that's absurd. Well, we somehow cleaned house. It wasn't easy, and I tell you some of those guys could flat out eat. In any case, try not to come here on a weekend. It's packed. Also try not to come here if you have eaten in the past week, or plan to eat anything else in the next week. Many of their dishes are common to other Cantonese restaurants, but they do everything bigger, more nicely presented, and with some adjustment to the flavor that seems more suitable for an Americanized palate...unless that's just the roids in the lobster talking.

ALRIGHT ppl this place is purdy BOMB but it aint OFF DA HOOK namsayingggg... if i gotta wait almost 2 hours to eat some lobster, it better be a lobster-gasm in my mouth and let me tell u... it wasn't. It was just yummy but i've had better in other montery park restaurants minus the 2 hour wait. and i can bet you every table that gets a medium lobster gets charged for 5.5lbs and i can also bet you that YOUR lobster prob wasn't 5.5lbs...ours sure didn't seem like it ordered all the most popular dishes including: spicy clams-- FISHYYYY and bleh filet Mignon with pepper n onions-- 蕐ummy but i've had better from westminster (OC) fried tofu-- this was fried to perfection and the sauce was light and complimentary yam leaves with garlic-- THIS WAS BOMB and a seasonal item but I know my momma can whip this dish out from her very own kitchen in less than 2 min and itd taste just as BOMB since ingredients were just oil, salt, garlic, and YAM leaves... can't really mess that one up. now our total was like 200 bucks for 4 ppl... that plus 2 hour wait + fisshhhhyyy clams = OVERATEDDDDDD. so basically, not coming back.

Dined here on Saturday 3/19/11 to celebrate my mother in law's birthday. 蔠e got there around 6pm and the placed was packed with customers! The atmosphere was pretty nice. 蔠ood floors, bright lighting, modern decor and overall pretty clean looking, which isn't always the case in some Asian restaurants. 蔄s we waited, we noticed that everyone, well almost everyone had ordered the lobster. 蔄pparently, that is what they are famous for. 蔛o when our party of 10 finally got settled down we of course ordered the lobster and nine other dishes. 蔍 am not a lobster fan, but I tried it out and it was pretty good. 蔈veryone else at our table LOVED it! 蔄t the end of the meal, the 6 lb lobster was gone! 蔛ervice was okay. 蔕ur waiter was pretty friendly, patient and helpful. 蔋e also had a good sense of humor. 蔕verall, a good experience. 蔍 would definitely dine here again.

So all the yelpers are probably raving about the Lobster, which is what they're known for. I think it's just alright, taste like any other Chinese restaurant in my opinion. Most of the dishes are pretty good and the customer service is actually decent too. I've been here about 3 times already and every time there's a small wait, nothing too crazy though. I think Newport is just an average Chinese restaurant... though it is VERY popular to locals... if you haven't gone here already, it's still worth a visit to see what all the hype is about.

BEST LOBSTER!! If you're here and you didn't order lobster, you're making a really big mistake!! There's a reason why they're always packed and why every table has a huge, succulent, steaming lobster in the middle. Their lobster is the best I've ever tasted, I dream about this place and drool about it my entire drive to socal. Every trip, and I mean every, requires a trip here. We usually order a 5lb lobster for the two of us. We devour as much as we can (almost all of it) and take the rest togo for the next day. It's messy, but finger lickin' good. Call ahead for reservations because they get busy! Don't park in the neighborhood, your car will get towed! Come hungry, leave HAPPPYYYYYY! :D

the boyfriends family was having a post-chinese new year dinner here and they invited me to come. we were told 7:30pm on a saturday night. 蔱veryone and their mamas were trying to park in the tiny lot so i drove a few blocks past the hospital and parked in a residential area. got there with half the family already there and had already put in our name to get seated. the wait was ridiculous! seriously even with me killing time simply amused by the GINORMOUS crabs out front it was too long of a wait. we didnt get seated until nearly 9pm...how is that OKAY? they seriously 蕁eed reservations at this place on weekends. 蔴uge parties were filling every area possible and the servers were running through us tryna get food out to the diners. we then got seated at a round table. but we had nearly 15 people and a baby. there was no booster chair & there was no elbow room. it made for a difficult experience. PLUS one grouchy employee was rolling his eyes that ben wouldnt move for him so he could set down the food. hahahahaha i laugh because ben WISHED he could move but we were all squished into our spots with no space possible. food comes out lickity split QUICK ...that may be because we ordered long before we were seated haha. we had a TON of dishes but I thought the fried rice was decent, the lobster was DELICIOUS!!!! the crab was not good...flavorless & greasy, the pork ( the red one) was simply yummy, the veggies were yum, and I really liked the mushrooms in this dish with sauteed veggies. water glasses were a little dingy and the service was so hectic I couldnt even ask for some napkins. hahaha the place isnt bad its just not AMAAAAZING. sorry!

I'm not sure how many synonyms I can use to describe this place because its amazing, delicious, decadent, authentic, and filled with so much seafood that you'll be dreaming of crabs and lobsters after you leave. Went for Chinese New Year and go the banquet menu for the table, and it was incredible. Stand outs were Hong Kong Noodles, filet mignon cubes, Kung Pao Chicken, House Lobster & Crab, and other things I don't know the English names of. I HIGHLY recommend this place.

If you like flavorful seafood, you will love this place. Pretty quick service and turn around on tables. �Favorites: �- Beef loc lac (french style beef) - **Newport Special Lobster - Clams with basil - Soft shell crab - Crispy fried squid with salt and pepper (good with pork chops too!) - Crab fried rice Cons: 1) PARKING on the weekends can be horrific but you can park on the streets for free. 蔛ometimes on the weekends they've had valet attending the lot. 2) NO RESERVATIONS...you have to wait for a table and it definitely gets packed on Saturday's and Sunday's. 蔍f you have a large party and you want to eat there on a Sunday, you have to go at least 1 hour or more to put in your name when you get there. 蔈arlier the better on the weekends for dinner.

Got here at 5:30 on a Saturday night. About a quarter of the restaurant was empty. That changed fast. From a little before 6 until the time we left there was dozens of people waiting for a table. We had a party of eleven. We ordered two lobsters, the Beef Loc Lac, a Squid dish (or spuid as it says on the menu), seafood chow mein, fried tofu, House Assorted Seafood soup, Rock Cod and probably something else that I don't remember. The dishes came out fast and furious. It was complete destruction, terror and mayhem as we attacked each dish. They were very good. Of course the lobster was the best. They were huge and meaty. I liked the Rock Cod, too. I haven't had that in years. I love squid (spuid), but I wasn't too high on the dish we ordered. Wasn't that flavorful. The chow mein was delicious. I also had a Strawberry Boba. Yummy! Sitting and digesting my food, I looked around the dining room. I thought to myself "How many of these people are Yelpers?" I picked out about four definites. The best is when my cousin noticed a lady who just returned from the restroom with a stream of toilet paper stuck to the bottom of her shoe. Service was really attentive. They keep the clean plates coming and the water full. Only problem I had with the service was one of the waiters had this mole with three inch long gray hairs growing out of it. It looked like a barnacle trying to feed. Damn, Dude! Cut those suckers off! It was almost as disgusting as the time in High School when I went swimming with some friends and one of them had like a four or five inch nipple hair. Even if it was a girl, I would have been sickened. Anyhow, try this place. Come hungry! I'm still in a food coma!

My fiancee and I came here for dinner last night after a long day of work. 蔜here was a wait, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. 蔜he immediate feeling I got from the place was a sense of urgency to order (that's probably why the wait wasn't so bad). 蔜here was always someone coming by to see if we were ready to order. 蔔ot a bad thing, definitely, but they came a little too often to the point where it was annoying. 蔈ither way, we ordered clams in satay and fish on a skillet. 蔍 also ordered a Tsing Tao that they forgot to give me (not good after a long day to forget someone's beer). �But holy shit the food was amazing. 蔜he clams were great. 蔍 don't like the ocean aftertaste as much as some people, but I definitely appreciated how fresh they were. 蔜he sauce was crazy good-it had onions, peppers, and carrots. 蔍t was great on top of the rice. 蔜his dish was the reason I knocked it down a star, though. 蔖ieces of the shells were in the sauce, so once in a while we would get a chunk and it hurt like hell to chew on them. 蔒y favorite, though, was the fish on the skillet. 蔍t was butter soft on the inside with a decent texture on the outside (good enough to be able to pick it up without it crumpling). 蔜he flavor was great and it had onions as well (who doesn't like grilled onions?). �I live about a block away from this place, so I'll definitely be back. 蔍've been seeing a lot about how awesome the lobster is so I'll be trying that next time when the cash is there =).

Overall: 3.5 Stars I went here on Mother's day and the place was crazy packed - even at 5:00 PM!! 蔍 went here before on a regular day and it was just a little less packed. I don't really recommend going in a super large group. 蔠e had 13 people in our party. 蔍 believe there are only 2 large tables for 10+. 蔄fter 2 hours of waiting, we finally got seated, but the group was split into two tables (table for 9 and a booth for 4). 蔒y grandma was like oh hells no. 蔛o we waited another 30 mins and got seated in the back on a long table. 蔍t was very inconvenient as we had to manually pass the dishes around and it's not easy to pass around certain dishes. 蔠ith dishes scattered all over the place, it looked like we really didn't have that much food. Now on to the food: Braided Crab Meat & Fish Maw Soup: Delicious, I always have it with red vinegar. Cat Fish Hour & Sour Soup: I think I was the only one who enjoyed this. 蔍t was either too "different" or cat fish wasn't their cup of tea for everyone else. Newport Special Crab: I prefer the lobster more. 蔠e had lobster last time and decided to the try the crab this time. 蔍t was a bit overcooked. 蔍've had better crab at Redondo Pier. Clams with Spicy Hot Sauce: 蔍t was good but the clams weren't that big. Shrimp with Walnut: It was pretty good. 蔔ot too overly mayoed. �Steamed Whole Fish: This dish was polished off so I'm guessing it was really good. 蔍 didn't have any. 蔜oo many bones to pick out not to mention that it was all the way on the other side of the table. Beef Loc Lac: Very flavorful, I have to eat it with lime juice. Veggies: We had 3 plates of green stir fried veggies. 蔍t was really good and fresh, not overly greasy and mushy. �Bean Curd in Brown Sauce: Not good/no flavor, I've had better in less fancier chinese restaurants Mystery Chicken Lettuce Wrap Dish: By mystery I mean my mom ordered it so I don't know what's it called. 蔔o one touched it. 蔍 heard it was super dry. 蔍 don't think we even took it home. This is definitely a place you need to try at least once because the restaurant offers a variety of seafood dishes. 蔋owever, you would have to be the judge of whether or not this place is worth the wait.

Good news and bad news. Good news is: This place has great lobster special and the most adorable individually wrapped lemonades. The bad news is: My lunch cost $83 +tip for only me. I won't complain too much about the price because I knew it was $15 a pound before I ordered it. It's not really meant for a single person to have for lunch but it came so highly recommended by Yelpers, I had to do it. The waiters watched in awe as I put down a 5lb lobster all by myself. I also ordered the thai style shrimp rice. It was gross. Not even close to thai rice. Do not order it. Now the worst part of this experience had to be the waiting. I waited an hour for the table. That's not an exaggeration. I also parked 3 blocks away. This place is wildly popular. Keep that in mind. This place could really benefit from creating a more efficient system to serve all those customers. I'm sure it has other good dishes but I won't wait another hour for a table.

I went with my ex here when we were still together on Vday in like 2010? Our relationship may have ended but hey the food here is AMAZING. I love their special style Lobster. I think that's like one of the most important things you should try. The other stuff is okay since it's like regular chinese food but they have deals you can get for a group for a cheaper price. For two people eating a variety of dishes is probably a bit much but the price is so worth it. It's look pretty nice inside to it's good for family and big groups. P.S.

I went to LA for a visit and was craving Chinese seafood so my cousin recommended this place. 蔈xcellent choice! �When we got here there was a pretty long line, but believe me, it was well worth the wait. We ordered the lobster special (~4-5 pounds), black bean clams, beef chow fun, shaking cubes of steak (bo luc lac) and of course sides of rice (not included with the entries). �The service was great (they actually speak decent English) and the food came out pretty fast. The meal was amazing! 蔜hey cooked the lobster perfectly and it had some type of ginger/garlic seasoning on it that just made it melt in your mouth. 蔜he clams were tasty, slightly above average from what you would get at typical Chinese restaurants. 蔜he beef chow fun was good, and was not oily like some other places. 蔜he shaking cubes of steak was tender and had a light pepper taste to it. 蔈verything was cooked good, looked good, and tasted even better! TIP: My cousin told me that when you order the lobster, they try to stick you with the largest lobsters so they can charge you more. 蔜ry to ask for the smaller ones (3-5 pounds) and they will come out cheaper, and the meat will be more flavorful. The only downside of this place was the price, but that was understandable because of the excellent food and service. 蔍 would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who wants loves seafood and especially lobster. 蔣ou won't be disappointed!

This is probably the best chinese restaurant I've been to... The restaurant itself is cute, the decorations, setting I like it a lot. When you enter on the right side where there's barriers between the different tables for large groups is so great because you feel all special and stuff for having a big group haha. They don't take reservations (I think, it has been a while?). Always usually wait more than 30 minutes. It's always so busy I swear --weekend at nights. Best avoid or even during lunchtime. Not so great to come. But if you come here, order the seafood aka the lobster/crab. I mean it is a seafood restaurant right? It does not disappoint. I'm always so full and satisfied after I come here.

We were in the mood for a good and authentic Chinese restaurant. And judging from Yelp reviews -- and from the crowd -- we thought that we were going to be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, the experience fell much below expectations. The wait for two was about 25 minutes before we were called. Oddly enough, though our number was called -- and we were told our table was ready -- we waited another 10 minutes while standing; an employee -- who I presume to be the manager -- said that they were preparing a "smaller table." Meanwhile, about five minutes into standing, we were given a menu and were [immediately] recommended the Newport Special Lobster (3.5 lbs @ $16 per pound -- which is conveniently/simply labeled as "Seasonal Price" and ultimately totaled about $56). We also ordered the Fried Noodle with Beef (~$7), Deep Fried Oyster (~$11), and Steamed Rice. After placing our order, we were eventually given a larger table (Wait... I thought we were waiting for a "smaller table?"). After a few minutes, our food began to arrive -- first the lobster, then the fried oyster, followed by the noodles and steamed rice. Certainly, I found the lobster to be good, unique, and flavorful -- though some purists would probably argue that the ingredients used to accompany the lobster is overpowering. The Fried Noodle with Beef and Deep Fried Oyster were also good (though unremarkable). What sort of annoyed me was that this restaurant was very stingy with napkins. The lobster is somewhat messy to eat; when we asked for additional napkins, they gave us three pieces, lol. My other complaints include the steamed rice being cold and filled to about a quarter of the container -- and the refill of steamed rice not being included when we requested to take home the remainder of our food. However, to the credit of one of the servers... he ensured that our water glasses were expediently filled. Overall, for a total of about $85 (plus tip), I'd expect less stinginess (particularly with regard to the napkins and quantity/temperature of the steamed rice), much better service (ex. more checking up with customers, etc.), and that leftover steamed rice be included with take-home requests. Would I return? Probably not. Additional Notes: - They do not accept American Express.

wow let me just say the lobsters here are amazingly mouthwateringly delicious. My cousin brought me here to treat me to lunch, since i was visiting home for winter break from college. We had to wait about 45 minutes to get seated. This place is busy ALLL day. We had thought that the wait time wouldn't be bad if we went a little bit after lunch hours, but nope..no difference. 3 o clock same wait. But well worth the wait, thanks to the lobster. The place is big and looks clean and nice. Service is excellent. Servers are funny but proper. We ordered the large lobster, string beans, and beef. We had tea and hot and sour soup as well. The string beans are seasoned to perfection, I love garlic and this dish is very garlic-y. The beef was good too, they all have a unique but authentic taste to it. You could tell they have special sauce ingredients, especially for the lobster. I am definately coming back here, i mark this place my favorite chinese restaurant.

Absolutely loved this place....when it comes to seafood and speedy service, I don't think it gets any better than Newport Seafood. I've heard that some other branches are not as good, but this one in San Gabriel is fantastic. 蔜he lines out the door are a testament to how popular this place is and forget about finding parking in the small lot. �The number and seating process is actually very efficient given the throngs of people here and we were seated with a party of 6 after about 45 minutes. 蔜here are private rooms, but my understanding is that this place does not take reservations. 蔅TW, we ate here on a Monday and it was packed....can't imagine what it's like on weekends. Once we were seated, we ordered quickly and the food came out at a lightening pace....which was great, since we were starving. 蔄 sampling of the hits: Lobster Newport Special - fantastic sauce with a nice kick of spiciness secondary to the jalapeno. 蔖iping hot and large chunks of meat. 蔍 easily counted 4-5 claw pieces in our order. Newport Elephant Clams - same great sauce but with fresh clams. 蔇elicious. Beef Loc Lac - this place may be known for seafood, but this beef dish was PERFECT! 蔜ender onions, amazing flavor, and perfectly cooked beef. 蔐ove, love love this. Deep fried tofu - a standard preparation but hot, fresh, and tasty. 蔜hey must have great woks in the kitchen. Chinese Broccoli with Dried Fish - got to have some veggies! Overall, Newport Seafood is one of the best Chinese/Vietnamese seafood restaurants I've had. 蔜heir lobster ranks up with the best of them....only Hong Kong Saigon in Sunnyvale has a better preparation and that's the much more expensive thousand year old egg battered Australian Lobster. 蔜he Newport Special lobster beats their regular deep fried lobster easily. �A really great meal and happy I was able to go here. 蔜hanks to Jackie F. for the spot on recommendation! I think Newport Seafood takes credit cards, but not American Express.

We love the food at Newport! 蔄s a lots of people have mentioned, the food there's pretty awesome. Almost everyone who works here speaks English. Wait is long, but food comes out fast -- actually so fast that sometimes we wonder if they cook their most favorite dishes in big batches and have them pretty much ready when you order it. Food's very fresh -- at least the times we've been there. The 2 stars is actually more 2.5, and here's why ... They're SLY & SNEAKY LITTLE BUGGERS! The last few times we've been there, there's almost something that they sneak by us. �One time it was the price of a whole fish dish. Another time it was them not letting us know how big of a lobster/crab they're picking for us -- we ended up with tons of left over... take a wild guess how much *that* dish cost us. �Another time it was charging us $18 for snow pea leaves dish, and not explaining to us in the beginning that they have pea leaves for $9-10, and snow pea leaves for twice the price!! Good food is great. 蔅ut if this is how they're running the business, I know they've lost our business.

Living is SD, I have been deprived of good chinese seafood options for a while now and this place was a treat for me...Though I had to give it 4 stars merely for the fact that it was my first time and I didn't order the right dishes...after I ordered, all of the lobster started coming out and I immediately regretted not ordering it...yes, I'm a dumbass. 蕁ext time I go, I'll get it and change my review...The clams were BOMB!

My honey took me and my parents here for dinner and the food was sooo good! 蔜he hour long wait was long but the food was so worth it! 蔜heir lobster is to-die for and has so many eggs on there (my fave!). 蔜he shrimp was HUGE and sooo good! 蔄nd OMG, we got this beef that was sooo tender! 蔈verything was amazing! I think there were at least 3 birthday celebrations that night too - everyone was singing happy birthday around us. The waiter was very helpful and service was great. 蔖arking was a HASSLE though! 蔜heir small parking lot was jam packed so we had to find street parking. 蔍t sucks that they don't take reservations and the line is really long. 蔜he best advice would probably be to get a number and then come back in an hour to get your table. Not cheap either! 蔍 think the bill was like around $300 for 4 people!

WOW! This place is amazing. I had dinner here with my family this past Saturday. My mom enjoys having family dinners when my sister comes to visit. I suggested we eat at Newport Seafood, because I have heard so much about this place. We all loved out experience. Service: The service was pretty good. The wait was about 1 hour, but that is to be expected at such a busy place. The wait staff was surprisingly friendly- much more than I am normally accustomed to at Chinese Restaurants. They were also very attentive. Drinks were promptly filled and they also consistently came to change change plates when they saw lobster shells building up. Food: The food is delicious. I absolutely love the House Lobster! We ordered a small lobster which was still a lot of food. A single lobster was much more then the 3 of us could consume. We also ordered the Cubed Filet Mignon which was very tender and flavorful. There was nothing that disappointed. Along with the steak and filet we also ordered Chinese Broccoli, Rice Noodles with Beef and Black Bean Sauce, and Hot and Sour Soup. Everything was great! I would recommend Newport Seafood. The Lobster is the thing to get here! It's a little pricey and the wait can get rather long, but it's worth it! This is probably my new favorite Chinese Restaurant!

Planned a dinner here for a party of seven at seven on a Wednesday. I went early (6:20pm) and the place was empty. By the time we sat seven it was still empty. They have a policy of not seating until the entire party arrives, but they bent it for us when we said we would order first. We never saw people waiting too long. But, if you get there early, you have no problems parking. Friends who showed up after 7, had to park on the street. After you order the food it will be out in moments. I'm going to list the foods in my order of preference: Crispy Fried Squid with Salt and Pepper: Great flavor and texture. The squid was perfectly cooked, it had a bite but wasn't chewy. It was a bit greasier than the last time I had it though. Deep Fried Tofu: Soft tofu with a light batter and lightly fried. It comes with a tempura sauce you drizzle on top. Chinese Broccoli with garlic: Chinese Broccoli lightly sauteed with chunks of garlic. It was a good balance for the other meal items. Newport Special Lobster: lobster is cut up and fried with scallions, onions and sauce. We got a medium (5lbs) the price was $16/lb. I like scooping the scallions, onions and lobster roe with sauce and eating over rice. Beef Loc Lac: Beef cubes with a soy based sauce presented on a bed of onions. It was really flavorful but on the salty side for my taste. House Special Rice Noodle: A mix of seafood and poultry with rice noodles. This was the most disappointing because it was bland. The first four dishes are must haves. Go with a big group and enjoy the food. For six dishes + non alcoholic beverages split between seven people, it ended up being $28/person. That's with a generous tip b/c we had an awesome server last night.

This place is amazingly good, which is why you probably have to wait a really long time. If the line was not so long, I would probably go here more often. I have been here twice, and I love the quality of food that i eat here. The lobster and 蕎alnut shrimp are sooo good. According to my friend, who have been coming for a few years, the quantity has decreased. Overall, it's a really great restaurant with amazing quality of food.

Hubby's coworker has been telling him for years to try this place, but we never had time. This time, I got together w/BFF who lives in LA & we tried: 1. Newport Special Lobster - very good, garlicky, finger-licking good. 2. House special sea trout whole fish (recommended by the waitress). It was good, but spicy, cooked just right 3. Beef Loc Lac, $11.95. Very tasty, esp if you squeeze the lime juice over it. 4. Chicken w/Chinese broccoli, $9.95. My least fav dish. Tasted good but nothing spectacular. We couldn't finish the meal & BFF was able to take leftovers home. It wasn't inexpensive, totalling $114 for the 4 items. BFF's hubby says the place used to be a Marie Callendar's, the outside looks like one but the inside has been converted into an Asian themed restaurant. They had live King Crabs in their tank! The staff's friendly & pretty fast w/serving the food & cleaning up.

Great place for a banquet meal. Just alright for the generic lunch specials. Their special banquet meal includes a variety of seafood dishes (fish maw soup, crab, lobster, clams, steamed fish) that is well worth the price. Portion sizes are large, and the food is tasty. We filled up THREE tables and every table had leftovers. Plus, a relatively clean location, with restrooms clean considering it's a Chinese restaurant! I'm just a little confused that the FIRST item that was served to us was the crab. Get it right, soup comes first!

4 1/2 stars. It is so worth the hour wait. Come with a larger group so you can try as much as you can. Portions are pretty big Pretty nice inside for a Chinese place Service is really friendly Colorful menu-order all the ones with pictures except the chicken lettuce wraps. Now on to the food.... Newport Special Lobster-Yes they are very known for it and I am not a big fan of lobster, but of course we had to get it. It's the best I ever tasted. The sauce and the flavor that gets into the lobster is amazing. $80 for a medium size that feeds about 6 people. Worth every penny! Calm with Spicy Hot Sauce-yummy, but I didn't really taste the heat at all. More of a basil taste, but still really good Filet Fish on Hot Sizzling Plate-The waiter reccomand this to us and we were impressed. Tender pieces of fish and great flavor. My mouth is watering just talkin bout it Beef 蔐oc Lac (French Sytle)-amazing....super tender and juicy. they give u alot compared to viet places they charge so much and give you so little. Chicken Krapron-The lettece wraps. Full of flavor but super super dry and didn't come with any sauce. This ruined my streak of a perfect meal. Ong Choi-Veges with loads of garlic. Loved it. Pecking Style Porkchop-Everyone like this dish, but I'm not a fan of sweet and sour sauce. Didn't understand how it's pecking style. The porkchops were tender though. I can't wait to come back here, but I live so far!

Get there early or be prepared to wait. Food: The house special lobster lives up to its reputation and was some of the best lobster I've had. 蔜he only down side is the price - the house special crab: recommended - french style beef: tasty and tender. 蕆ecommended - snow peas leaves with garlic: good but there is better. - fried tofu with XO Sauce - the XO sauce was amazing! the tofu itself wasnt that flavorful. King Crab: Overpriced and not worth it. 蔄t $32/lb I would expect this to be dish to be better. 蔠e had it cooked 2 ways, steamed and fried. 蔛teamed with garlic is definitely the way to go if you are going to get it. Kung Pao Chicken?: Skip this and fill up on one of their many other dishes. Service/Wait: The waitstaff is very good at getting everything out to you fast. 蔛ure they aren't the most friendly people but what do you expect from a Asian Restaurant.

I have been here several times and have always marveled at the tastiness of the food. I recently had the Mongolian beef with crispy chicken chow mein. It was flavorful and well presented. The place is clean and the decor is contemporary including an area to accommodate private parties. The service is quick and friendly. And the price is ridiculously low. A lunch for two was around $20! Like many good Chinese restaurants you will be served as much 蔴ot tea as you desire. You can't really go wrong here!

I've been here around 5 times since Jay B. recommended it and on only one occasion was I really disappointed. Unfortunately, I had brought the vice president of Mitsubishi with me and the Lobster on that evening was truly "fishy". Not at the quality that I had experienced on every other occasion. So they get 4/5 for that one lousy, face-losing experience for me. I guess I should have complained quietly to the manager but if you know Japanese from Japan, you would know that that would have caused more problems than it would solve. The apologies, etc. would have humiliated him, me and the manager. So instead I just looked like an ass for recommending it and that was that. But in general, this is one of the few Chinese restaurants in LA that comes close to a Hong Kong dining experience. I'm not going to lie and say that its equivalent. I mean, in HK the lobster is still walking around the table fighting with you, negotiating his price, insulting your ancestors, etc. but its a damn good, maybe the best option is this sea of sad Asiany-LA restaurants. The flavors, freshness, service and DECOR are all superb. Wonderful not to have to sit under those ridiculous bright Chinese dinner lights which make you, your food and your date all look like they need some acne treatment. Of course, there is a reason for those lights but that's best saved for another rant. Anyway, I love this spot. I would marry their House Special lobster if she was a little more attractive. God bless Jay B. for recommending it. The good news is that I'm moving to Alhambra to spend more time getting msg-high from the amazing selection of San Gabriel culinary establishments. Mgoi sai!

Drove an hour from UCLA to come here because a family friend loved this place so much they ate here twice in one weekend. Ordered the 'small' lobster--hands down the best lobster I have ever eaten. Large chunks of meat and the seasoning was intense and complimented the lobster meat very nicely. Also had the Taiwanese style clams, Chinese broccoli which was also the best I have ever had (tender, not stringy and not too much sauce on top). Make sure you make reservations because this place is packed!

My mind is officially blown from this place, and I am thoroughly impressed with the food and service as far as Chinese restaurants go. Our party of five came around 5pm, and we only waited approx. 30 min to get a table (parking may be kind of hard to find though, get here early because once 7pm hit, there were people lining out of the venue!). Ideally, everyone says to get the lobster, but at a seasonal price of $15/lb, that's kind of expensive for your average college student. So we skipped the lobster and ordered the spicy clams with thai basil, beef loc lac, vegetable deluxe, and spicy catfish in a claypot. The spicy clams with thai basil was really good, the clams were juicy and definitely not overcooked. Also the spiciness wasn't too overpowering and only left a partial numbing on my lips ... has the right balance of spicy and savory. The sauce was AMAZING. Goes so well with the rice. Beef loc lac, of Vietnamese-styled cooked beef, was something I wasn't expected. Sprinkle salt, pepper and lime juice to enhance the flavor. The cubes of beef were succulent and are worth getting. The vegetable deluxe isn't really mind-blowing, but it's good to have to clean your palette in prep. for the other food. At first we almost didn't get the spicy catfish, but we were glad we did. Sweet and succulent, the catfish was cooked to perfection and the sauce was kick-ass. I also liked how the catfish wasn't overcooked too, it pretty much fell apart in my mouth. As far as the price goes, for a party 5, we only dropped $12/person, and that included tip and tax too. This place has def. won my heart over!

This is definitely my go to Chinese seafood restaurant for special occasions. 蔜he reason why i added: "for special occasions" is because we hardly... HARDLY ever leave this restaurant without dropping at least $200. 蔜his is only because, who can say no to fresh lobster sauteed in garlic, green onions and whatever drug they put in there to make the dish so delicious?.. and the french style filet mignon cubed beef? oh yes, yes, yes.. what about the gigantic fried fish smothered in spicy garlic sauce? definitely yes. and the we can't forget about the greens.. oh! and the steamed clams and.. the honey walnut shrimp! You get the picture. It's seriously worth the money.. and the occasional 45 minute wait, but seriously. GO... you. have. to... !!

Came with a group of ten, it was as good as I remembered it. 蔜he new location is much improved over the previous location to the West, that was really a hole-in-the-wall and looked like a typical Chinese take-out place. 蔜he owners have plowed some of the $ earned back into making the dining experience better (and less crowded). 蔛till, it's all about the seafood... 蔒y advice is come with a large group and get the $268 banquet meal. 蔍t came with: Crab Meat Shark Fin with Asparagus Soup Baked Crab with Salt and Pepper Special Lobster Sea Cucumber with Black Mushroom Kong Pao Shrimp, Chicken & Beef Peking Style Pork Chop Clam with Spicy Hot Sauce Steamed Whole Fish Sauteed Peasprout Yang Chow Fried Rice The reason this is a good deal is the lobster itself will set you back at least $60-70, and the crabs will probably be around $40. 蔠e got there at 7:45 PM on a Saturday and had to wait 45 minutes for our table... 蔍n the meantime we got hungrier and hungrier... �The portions were HUGE, they are probably at least double if not triple the portion of your "average" Chinese restaurant. 蔜he lobster, fish, and crab were especially good. 蔜he Sea Cucumber was OK, nothing too special. 蔛oup had very little shark fin, mostly asparagus. They did upsell us on the lobster, saying that they ran out of the "smaller lobsters" included in the set menu, had to pay for an extra 3-4 pounds. 蔜hat cost us an extra $30. 蔅ut overall, the quality of the lobster was excellent as usual, it was a huge lobster and I didn't expect the meat to be so tender and flavor for its size. 蔜his is the best place to come for quality lobster. 蔍t looks like the best time to come is probably around 5PM or 8:30PM, the wait is the shortest then.

I give this place 5 stars! The food is delicious and the service is wonderful! I mean, lets be honest here, when you go to an asian restaurant you don't expect good service (I can say this cuz I'm asian), but here, they are attentive and on top of things. They change your plate like every 15 mins and are always there when you need something. Love it Here's what you need to eat when you visit: 1. Bo luc lac (Shaken Beef) 2. Lobster House Special 3. Fried Tofu 4. Stir-fried pea sprouts 5. Clams with black bean sauce

Someone recently asked me what my favorite restaurant in LA was and while I couldn't give just one answer, this restaurant was one of the ones that popped up in my head. I've added at least another dozen visits to this place and the food has been good almost every time. The one time it was lacking was because we went during the weird lunch - to - dinner transition hour. But if you go when the restaurant is busy, which is pretty much 90% of the time, the food is fantastic. And the service..wow. Is this really an Asian restaurant? Maybe it's because they know us now, but they're always spot on. Water glasses constantly filled, minimal wait times to take your order, always friendly and smiling. If I ever move out of LA, I can honestly say this will be the restaurant I'll miss most.

It's a lot of food but well worth it!! 蔠e came here the other day not doing it, and a medium sized lobster was already $75 and the 1/2 steamed fish 1/2 fried fish (sauce is AMAZING) was already $55. 蔜hey do allow substitutions for a small fee but of course, I think it's definitely worth it! The best is of course, the infamous lobster dish! 蔄lways good! The crab is also really good! 1/2 steamed and 1/2 fried fish! I really loved the fried part! The sauce is sooo good! Lots of ginger! Bo Luc Lac, vietnamese/french style beef! �Pea sprouts are always good! The kung pao chicken/beef/shrimp was also good. 蔜he beef seemed like it had been fried which was interesting and really good!

I was so freaking full. This is the 2nd meal I've had at Newport and it certainly did not disappoint. So I'll save the BSing and get to the food. 4 lbs of house lobster - sooo good I can eat this the whole night 2 lbs of giant prawn - sorry, overcooked so the meat was gummy geoduck 2 ways: soup - ok seafood clear broth soup stirfry with beasprouts - kind of a mess Clams in basil sauce - above par French style filet migon - above par Steak on cast iron platter - above par 2 lb Steamed seabass is to die for. Great display of cooking technique by removing the spine. 90% of what's on the plate was edible. And the sauce was awesome. Stirfry large peasprouts - tender, great dish. Service was very typical Asian and always upselling. And even though I expected it, they were hard selling us and I didn't appreciate it. Cut whatever recommended weight of seafood by half and you'll still be very stuffed. In short, the whole dining experience could have been perfect if i limited my ordering greediness to 2 key dishes only. 蔜he house lobster and the steamed fish. I shouldn't have gone for quantity which was hard cuz we had a party of 9 to feed. (pumping fist) I will be back and ready to perfect my order...

Holy 7.75 pounds of lobster... ONE lobster! 蔜he lobster was definitely HUGE, the 10 of us could not even finish it! 蔍t was definitely super tasty and it made us sick of lobster because when they served lobster the next night at the wedding we attended, none of us wanted to eat it. 蔠e also ordered a shrimp salad, steak cubes, a hot and sour fish soup and clams. 蔍t was a huge meal and it only came out to be 35 dollars a person including tip! 蔔ot bad at all. 蔜he service was friendly and they joked around with us, which made us feel at home. 蔠e came at a good time (about 6pm), because we were seated right away and while we were leaving, there was a parking lot full of people waiting.

San Gabriel on a weekday?!?! was my response when my friend invited me to a birthday dinner at Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant. I almost made the mistake of opting out, but 600+ reviews and still maintaining a 4.5 average, it was deserving of a trek to the 626. Alice ordered for the whole table, and boy did she get it right. We had the crab soup, garlic lobster, crab in black bean sauce, chicken lettuce wraps, the beef dish everyone raves about, sauteed clams, and the fried tofu. Every single dish was deserving of 5 stars. She asked me how I liked the food, I praised her for getting it right. It was the perfect order. Then on our way out, I looked to see what everyone was eating. It was pretty much the same stuff we had. One table had the exact same order. No more A&W Seafood. From now on I will be braving the 10 fwy with all it's horrendous drivers just for Chinese lobster and crab.

Loved this place! 蔒y family came here for Thanksgiving dinner and let me tell you, turkey was not missed one bit! 蔠e had 2 orders of the 5lb lobster, and i couldn't get enough! 蔜hat sauce is good enough to eat with just rice! 蔠e ordered so many dishes I can't remember them all, but boy was it worth the wait! 蔠e waited 45 mins to even sit down, but it's all worth it at the end. 蔛ervice is quick, and professional, they turn tables quickly, and its the no bullshit Chinese service. 蔜his place is not cheap by any means, so for those of you complaining about expensive lobster, there's always Red Lobster. 蔊o away.

I can see why this place got so many high reviews, besides the fact that it's listed on LA Weekly's 99 essentials. 蔠hat makes it nice is that it feels like a nice restaurant that actually tries to have tasteful decor. 蔜he entire staff speaks English, which is lovely for non-Chinese/Vietnamese speakers. 蔛ure, it's a little pricey for the house special lobster and you do spend a decent amount of time waiting, but you're not sitting in some dumpy, greasy looking restaurant. 蔜his location is such a contrast compared to the Garden Grove location! The waiter informed us that the "smaller" lobsters (the ones that are under three pounds) are usually available on the weeknights. 蔜hey rarely have "small" lobsters on the weekends because they have tons of large parties that come in during that time. 蔛o factor in that a lobster will be a minimum of 4 pounds. �Also since so many reviewers recommended the bo luc lac (shaken beef), if you just want to try that dish then I recommend getting the bo luc lac rice plate. 蔉or one thing it's cheaper and it comes with rice. 蔣ou'll kill two birds with one stone! 蔝nless you really want to eat a whole plate of shaken beef?

Oh. My. God. 蔍 believe I tasted heaven! It is as good as it gets! Newport Tan Cang reminded me of my childhood memories, where every Friday, my family visited Chinatown in Chicago and had authentic Chinese seafood. 蔍 haven't had great authentic Chinese food for over 20 years, and wow, did this restaurant bring back the memories in technicolor, and plus some. �Believe all the reviews - it's worth the wait. 蔐uckily, we went during an off-peak time, so we were seated immediately. 蔄 waiter came by to take our order: the famous house special crab, seafood with bean curd soup, watercress with garlic, and French beef, and the dishes arrived in minutes. 蔍t was such a feast for two people, but we devoured it. 蔜he crab was succulent and oh so fresh. 蔍 sucked the meat and sauce off - savoring every moment. 蔜he seafood soup was not as I expected, but I loved it in any case. 蔍t was pure broth packed full of seafood, not the starchy, thick soup that I'm used to. 蔜he beef - so plentiful and tender, and vegetables full of flavor - what a dinner! 蔠e couldn't believe in the luck we had in discovering this place on Yelp - nor how close it was to our home. �After our meal, we examined the menu for future meals and then walked up to the glass aquariums that held live king crabs, lobster, clams, and shrimp. 蔠e can't believe our luck in discovering this place on Yelp and are now true believers in the power of word of mouth. 蔠hat a great way to celebrate the first day of 2011! Now, even if you're not a seafood lover, I believe their other dishes are phenomenal and it's still worth a trip. 蔅ring a lot of people, so you can sample many of their dishes. �We are already planning our next trip - which will include the LOBSTER! 蔣ou gotta try this place out - or you haven't lived. 蔍t's really that good.

Lobster was excellent, very tasty and nice and soft. 蔛ometimes places don't cook the lobster properly and it gets chewy, but this was delicious! However the thai seafood soup was just okay and the I didn't really like the french style beef because it was too salty. 蔍 think it was just the group of pieces i tried tho because everyone else seemed to like it. �We ordered the small lobster and it was plenty for 4 ppl including the other dishes. 蔍'm pretty stuffed right now. 蔄lso, their oranges at the end of the meal were great!

It was Friday night and Chris and I were starving! We expected to walk into Newport being packed and having to wait at least an hour, but to our pleasant surprise, there was NO wait at all! What a great way to start off our dinner. Our waiter was friendly and knew what we were going to order before I even finished saying the dish. I guess they know what's frequently asked for and we were right for deciding to go with what we did. Beef Loc Lac: Tender and very well seasoned. Chris loved this dish. Clam with Basil: For the price, it's a bang for your buck! They give you a generous portion of clam and it could easily fill two people up. Not to mention, it tastes great! We didn't need to order a lot since rice came with both dishes, and they give you so much food. Newport was one of the best places to dine at in SGV, and you don't even have to break the bank for it.

I'm telling you, this place never disappoints. I went here twice this past week. Once with the family for dinner and then the next day for lunch with coworkers. I'm a regular here, so the waiters were like, back so soon? I started laughing, but I was thinking the exact same thing. My recommendation for family dinner is to order the preset menu... I really wanted to order the $238, but my mom thought it was way too much food and wanted to order al carte. So guess what? I bill came out to just about the same... I was so annoyed with her because we could have gotten a few more dishes. Lesson learned.

Amazeballs! We ordered 4 dishes (the waiter was probably laughing at us) between the 2 of us. We couldn't help it, everything looked so enticing. All 4 dishes were GOOD! House Special Crab -- delicious blend of spices. Very good "wok hei." They slap the crab legs with the back of the knife, so the legs are semi cracked so it made it easier to eat. The "meaty" pieces melts in your mouth. It was a delicious crab dish for the self proclaim crab Queen. Finger licking good. Sauteed Pea Sprouts -- my mom always order this dish whenever she eats at an Asian seafood restaurant. Never thought of it as anything special, but they make is AMAZING here. They use small pea sprouts and they sauteed it with LOTS of garlic and it seems like they added some "soup base" to it in the process of cooking it give it an extra "umph" of flavor. French Beef -- almost everyone who comes here orders this dish, so we had to get it too. Large and tender pieces of beef. Did I mention tender? Packed with flavor. They give you some special salt for dipping and a wedge of lime too. I liked the salt on it, not the lime. Whole Crispy Tilapia -- a little bland by itself, could use a sprinkle of the salt they give you with the French Beef dish, but this dish does come with a special "sweet and sour" sauce on the side. When you dip it in the sauce, it transforms into a yummlicious dish. I was wowed by the difference the sauce made. I'll be recommending this place for the relatives who always asks me what is good to eat in LA. Solid 5 out of 5 stars for Newport Tan Cang. Great service too. Another great recommendation by Johnathan Gold.

Their Newport Special lobster is definitely worth the visit, but get there early because there is always a crowd. My friend and I met here at 5:30 and was able to score a seat right away. The service is attentive but brisk--they seem to have the process of seating, feeding and releasing people down to a science. We ordered the lobster, of course, a plate garlic-sauteed broccoli, and a beef dish that I forget the name of. It was small pieces of sauteed filet mignon in some kind of sauce and it was scrumptious! Everything was really so very good, my friend and I ended up eating WAY too much. I'm looking forward to my next visit :)

Delicious chinese food! 蕀mmm....I think I gained 2 lbs just from all the yummy lunch specials! They are famous for their lobster, of course. 蔠e came here for my dad's birthday one year and it was packed! 蔅ut the lobster and the tender beef dish is definitely worth it! Lunch specials: $5.25-$6.75 each plate. 蔜he plate is kinda small, but it is lunch special. 蔇elicious! 蔐ots of different type of lunch special plates. We ordered: -beef chow fun, dry Hong Kong style: 蕐ummy, a little "wet"ter than I would've liked but still good. -pea sprouts veggie dish: 蔭 little oily, but it's so good! -shrimp in garlic sauce: 蕇picy but generous amount of shrmp. 蔯omes with veggies (onion, red and green peppers, and the black wood ear). -Kung pao chicken: 蕀y brother's favorite from this restaurant. 蔆hicken is nice and crispy with good peanuts for an added crunch and yummy scallions to add flavor. lunch specials come with soup. 蕎e got hot and sour soup and it was spicy! For my parents and me: our bill was $30 + tax and tip. 蕁ot bad! 蔍 think I would prefer this over dim sum. There's definitely a wait at this restaurant but this is good chinese food!

This place is a great chinese seafood restaurant. 蔈very dish that we ordered was good, and we even got the lobster. 蔍t ended up costing about 130 for 4 people who don't eat very much (we did have some leftovers). I thought the lobster was good, but not amazing, and I didn't think it was an especially good deal. 蔍t was something like $17 a pound, minimum 3 lbs. 蔜he other dishes were pretty similar to what we'd get at any other chinese seafood restaurant. I guess I'm always jaded when there's a line out the door. 蔍 didn't think it was worth the hour wait. 蔍 guess I just don't get it.

Just to make this short, because I'm sure a lot of people already know how good this place is, NTC = authentic, tasty Chinese seafood. There is reason behind its high rating and long lines. Service is a little better than what you're used to from Chinese restaurants. Please just go and eat here, at least once, even if you don't like Chinese food.

Okay, there is a reason this place has 4.5 stars out of 500+ reviews. 蔜he food here is *that* good. 蔄 friend of the Hubs' uncle had us meet him and his family here for dinner. 蔠e got there around 7pm on a Saturday and there was a pretty big waiting list. 蔇espite this, it was fairly organized and our wait was only about 30 minutes. 蔜hey turn tables super fast here and don't mind causing a ruckus while they do it. Onto the food...uncle's friend and his wife wanted to order and we were happy to allow them. 蔍 think they ordered an eight dish set course. By the way, I love being taken to someone's favorite restaurant and letting them order for me. �We got crabs cooked two ways (one lightly battered/fried and one in a brown sauce). 蔅oth were delish. 蔍 was sad I was in front of guests or else I would have not been so polite and really dug into those claws like I do at home. 蔋a! 蔜here was also a vegetable dish (sauteed peasprouts...simple and delicious), a chicken dish (awesome and I don't even like chicken), clam dish (a little slimy and bland), a seafood soup (also bland but with lots of seafood), a calamari dish (yummy!), and a whole streamed fish (super tender and flavorful). 蔒y absolutely favorite dish that night, though, was the geoduck salad. 蔜his was my first time having geoduck too. 蔍t was thinly sliced and mixed with bean sprouts, onions, and chili peppers in a light (fish?) sauce. 蔛o spicy but sooooo GOOD. �Overall, I was really impressed with the food. 蔛ervice was pretty good. 蔜he food came out super fast. 蔖ortions seem a little bit small but that could just be my greedy, hungry eyes talking. I can't believe when I was living in the SGV, I never knew about this place. 蔔ow I have to drive 45 minutes to eat here but hey, it's worth it.

I came here once for dinner and got all the chef's recommended dishes (which was good the first time, but horrible the second time), and came here a good several times for their lunch. Based on the latest visit, I give it 2 stars. Several reasons for this low rating: increased in price, mediocre service, taste/quality has gone down. To start off, I have to agree with many yelpers, yes the food is "good." Especially if you come during dinner, at first sight, smell, and taste, it's "good." BUT if you come during lunch, this place is a disappointment: They serve a complimentary soup, which is the same soup every day; I wouldn't doubt that they mix the leftovers from the day before with the new batch. The consistency of the soup gets thicker by the day, it is now almost jelly-like. yuck. On top of that, it's lukewarm... double YUCK. The entrees are "good," and i say it with quotations because anything with MSG, coloring, oil, and sugar, has to be appealing and good, right? well, they add more of all the above. Portion size is ok. The sauce on certain dishes are usually on the thick side. Food is never quite hot enough. Quality is inconsistent. At the end of the meal, they serve room-temperature orange wedges taken out of a bin that sits next to the dirty dish corner. :X If food is prepared in a way that abandons freshness, and replaced with all the artificial added flavors, I really can't give it more than 2 stars. Lastly, may I suggest a similar type of restaurant, Tin Tin on Garvey, that serves pretty much the same food, but with more variety, cheaper, better soup, and HOT dishes. Sounds like I'm doing a commercial for them, but trust me, neither of these restaurants are my type. It's just, in all honesty, it's a much much better value.

I feel like Newport has been written to death about and it's all mostly accurate, so I'll keep this short. Definitely definitely a five star place based on food. Eating the lobster here should be on everyone's bucketlist of things to accomplish in life. I would become a fisherman...lobstererman if it meant I could eat this every single day. The bo luc lac (beef cubes) are tasty as well. Lunch specials are cheap and delicious. A pretty comprehensive and authentic Chinese family style meal can be had here with the great variety and tasty offerings. Long waits when busy!

I stop by here everytime when I come to LA. 蔜he service is quick and good, surprisingly for a Chinese restaurant. I heard it's Vietnamese owned. 蔒y nephew loves this one Chinese waiter and always wants to be held by him. �We tend to order the same food because it's so good. 1. House Lobster special - it's so fresh that the meat comes easily off the shell. Very crunchy and sweet. and the sauce is delish! 2. Deep fried tofu - something about it is addicting. I can pop 4 in my mouth like nothing 3. French style filet mignon - can't go wrong with this dish 4. Pan friend house noodles - good but no the best I've had Also tried the Pea sprouts and black beans clams which were all okay. The big pea sprouts taste better than the small ones.

Two of our friends have been talking about this place for awhile now and finally 蔵t happened tonite. We arrive around 7 pm, and being a saturday, parking was full and there was a long wait outside the restaurant. As expected, we waited for almost an hour , however we got one of the special rooms for ourselves since we were party of seven (7). �We left the ordering to them and since they've been here a couple of times, they ordered Bean Curd Szechuan style soup for the start, we have calamari for appetizer, Mongolian beef, Sweet and sour Flounder, Kangkong in garlic sauce and their House special Lobster (Medium size) 蕋he one priced at $80 dollars. Honestly, all the food we ate did not disappoint. They're not only tasty and flavorful, but amazingly good. I myself loved their kangkong but I find the mongolian beef a little salty but their House Special Lobster is to die for. If 蔜hanh long in San Francisco have their Vietnamese Roast Crab, Tang Cang a.k.a. Newport Seafood have their own House Special Lobster than everyone keep coming back for. �The group decided that we will come back for more...Our bill came to $200 including tip of $26.00 dollars however, everyone liked what they have and we left all praises for their food.

Here's why this place deserves 4 stars only: I went there tonight with a bunch of friends and really had a great time. 蔜he lobster was amazing and plentiful. 蔜he Geo Duck was yummy with basil and bean spouts. 蔍 can't really complain about the cubed beef steak or the deep fried shrimp. 蔒y only complaint was that the parking lot is too small for the large dinner crowd, and so I ended up having to parallel park for about 10 minutes with busy SGV traffic. 蔕kay, traffic isn't really the restaurant's fault, but the parking should be have a complimentary valet. 蔕ther than that, I love the food. 蔜his was my second time going there. �Food--5 stars Service--4-5 stars (They were very attentive to my table) Parking/location--Eh.

Best things about the experience is the service, very fast serving time, lobster presentation, food is fresh out of the wok and with the exception of the soup - the food still quite hot when bought to the table. 蔜hough I like ginger scallion or black bean more than their house special style, the lobster is quite good, and loaded up with scallions. 蔍 always prefer a succulent, wet seafood dish over a dry one. �Seasonal price, surprising a bit sweet, the small lobster order is about 4 pounds and perfect for two people. �Medium lobster is 6 to 7 pounds. 蔄lso had the famous beef dish here, I would definitely skip that the next time. 蔇ecent but not that tender and not as good as I expected. 蔉lavor is a bit sweet as well, and peppery. 蔅oth dishes actually taste a bit similar. 蔅eef dish portion size is really only for two. Fish maw and crab soup is surprisingly average, hardly any fish nor crab. 蔛tarchy, with a bit of egg whites, pretty uneventful, had to load up it up with white pepper and soy. 蔍 had this soup often in SF and it is much better there. 蔇efinitely skip that too. Will have to try the lobster in another type of style before giving this place five stars. New plates are swapped in quite often. 蔙enovated Marie Calendar restaurant, the parking lot is right next door. 蔅eer and wine is on the menu. Casual and comfortable ambiance, very noisy.

My friend and I went here with my three kids for lunch on a weekday. I was very impressed! First of all, it's good, authentic Chinese food, with great flavors and a great selection for a weekday lunch menu... And considering the lunchtime special prices, the portions are huge... These were full-sized dinner portions. Parking is really good, since this is in the same location where the Marie Callendars used to be. Biggest rave of all...the staff was the friendliest I have ever encountered at a good (authentic) Chinese restaurant... Generally speaking, in other places, they seem annoyed to see a white-looking person show up; herethey were really nice, especially to my kids. Definitely recommend!

This place is pretty good. I like their soup. Not a huge crab person so it's ok. The beef with tomato is chepa and excellent. Only downside here is it's pretty expensive.

1 dish that deserves it all: House special LOBSTER! Things i tried: House special lobster Deep fried fish House special lobster: This place has the best lobster i have ever tried. Very flavorful and tasty! It was addicting and i couldnt stop eating it. Also i couldnt stop thinking about it ever since i left the place. I would sooo recommend this place for Lobster. Deep Fried Fish: Normal, plain. You just dip it in garlic/ginger fish sauce. (would not recommend) Service: Outstanding service from the time we came in to the end. Everyone should come here to try their lobster! overall: 5!

We've been to this restaurant twice so far. First time we got the house special lobster. We ordered the smallest size as possible, and there was enough for 4! Embarrassingly enough, the two of us managed to eat it all because it was so good.( Well, we thought that it wouldn't taste as good as reheat next day.) Next time we went we ordered the house special crab. We liked it too. Although, personally I feel that crab is a lot of work for little return. Not much there to eat! So unless you are a crab lover, go for the lobster! Lots of people there. So go before or after the main meal times, and the wait won't be as long. Despite of the crowd, the service staff has always been friendly and fast.

Parking is a hassle at this place but only because it is so popular here. 蔍 came here with a group of 8 and had to wait about an hour. The wait was well worth it. 蔉or a Chinese restaurant, it had really good service. 蔠e ordered the signature dishes of the lobster and the Shaken Beef. 蔅oth were amazing. 蔜he limes really added to the flavor of the Shaken Beef, and it was a melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. 蔍 couldn't get enough of the lobster. 蔍t was dissected perfectly, so we really didn't have to work that hard to get at all the meat. �The other dishes we ordered were good, but they were overshadowed by the beef and lobster.

Came here several times with group from work. �Yeah.... its okay" been a life long fan of sea food (and Asian Cuisine), and yes fresh is always better. 蔅ut something about plucking a crustacean out of a fish tank that god knows when the last time the water was changed. Fortunately all is covered with pretty good sauces and flavors and hides the mystery. Huge lobsters very impressive, but i'm a fan of young succulent lobster meat rather than the 80 year old beasts for my lobster (got my fair share of lobster in my lobster diving days). Last time there i had a group of 8 people, they forgot about me, you get a number when you walk in but apperantly the number means nothing, i snuck a peek at their scheduling book and the numbers were no where to be found. 蔠hatever.....

I planned a b-day lunch with the family and had been craving one thing... lobstaaahhh, with the Boston accent. Actually, nevermind I hate the Boston Celtics, and we're eating Chinese-Vietnamese style lobster, so let's pronounce lobster with an Asian accent, which uhh... still sounds like lobstaaahhh. It just seemed like a place that gets packed on the weekends, so I made it a point to go early around 1130. The restaurant was nicely decorated, very modern, clean and contemporary. We got right down to ordering from the lunch special menu, in which mostly everything is less than $10. Usually, places only have lunch specials on weekdays for lunch only, so props to this restaurant for allowing it on weekends. For 5 people, a 4 lb lobster was plenty, at around $15-16 per pound as I recall. Like most places, I thought they were going to bring out the still squirming lobster and do the whole show and dance. There was none of that. Within minutes, voila, the fully cooked and steaming house special lobster appeared on our table. We also ordered beef chow fun, gai lan, clams with basil sauce, crispy fish, and shrimp with tofu. I thought every dish was good, no extreme let downs. Nothing was too salty. Gotta hand it to the lobster, which the meat was sweet, tender, and succulent. That green scallion house special sauce was finger lickin' good. I've had house special lobsters everywhere else, including in Garden Grove/Westminster/Santa Ana, but the quality of this lobster just seemed to taste better. Service was prompt and robotic as usual, taking away clean plates every other minute while we were licking our fingers clean of green scallion lobster sauce. By the time we left the restaurant around 1230, there was a long wait already. 3.5 stars.

Seeing as though so many people yelp Newport and it comes out with such great reviews I knew that I had to go and try it for myself. Considering I live in San Gabriel I've passed by this restaurant countless times and I've seen those long lines that lead all the way outside. Knowing that Newport had such positive feedback I knew that the seafood would be fresh and delicious. The waiter seemed to be on top of things as he knew what I was about to order before I could finish saying what I had decided to order; he would cut me off and continue and nod his head and smile. The food was excellent. Unfortunately, this restaurant is very loud and noisy and adding to that, the waiters who have nothing to do talked very loud and obnoxiously near the counter and entrance/exit to the kitchen. That doesn't mean I won't come back. I mean, who even listens to the waiters talking right? If you don't pay attention and try and listen to them talking you won't really notice because there are always so many people talking it drowns out the loud talking noise of the waiters. This is one of the best Seafood/Chinese food restaurants in all of San Gabriel. My first experience has been worth every penny spent!

This restaurant is super busy and crowded on a weekend, so beware. 蔜hankfully, the party I came with knew the owners and we got a big table quick. We came to celebrate a parent's birthday. 蔠e ordered fried shrimp, shrimp & walnuts, calamari, some other dishes, and of course the grand daddy of them all, the XL Lobster!!! Food was prepared and served very fast. 蔈verything was seasoned well and tasted great. 蔜he lobster came at the end. 蔍'm an expert and picking out the meat and doing some major work to get at the nitty gritty, and I definitely get down and dirty too! The garlic and onion sauce that they cook the lobster in is pretty common in Chinese cuisine, but their's is just a little bit more yummy!

My friends and I went there to celebrate Chinese new year's last night. The food was simply amazing.. they don't take reservation, so we ended up waiting a bit, but considering the cheap price & the quality of the food, it's nothing! we had 6-7 dishes a few of us had a drink and each person paid 30bucks including 20% tip.. not bad at all!! Luckily, i was there with Chinede friends, so we had no trouble when it comes to what to order, but the lobster was amazing, i wish i knew how you call it though.. If I must say something downside of this place... it's pretty heavy meal, a bit oily and garlicky.. so please be there hungry, and it's always better as a group of ppl since you can share everything at the round table. enjoy!

For years, I thought that I was getting the real deal when I dined at the Newport Tan Cang in Orange County. It wasn't until Victor L. pointed out to me that the real deal is in SGV. What??!!!! Really?? Man, apparently, I have been tricked all these years!! Apparently, Newport Tan Cang was originally in Orange County. Later the original owners opened up a location in SGV and sold their Orange County location. The food at the Orange County location is good, but the SGV location is 10 x better!! I love all the food that they serve here. I usually order the infamous lobster, shaken beef, hot pot, kung pao chicken, and fried fish. Each dish has its own impeccable and scrumptious aroma/taste that makes my taste buds do the happy dance. The shakes here are as good as well! They use fresh fruits, so that is a big plus in my eyes. The service here is outstanding. They really cater to your needs and constantly check up on you.

"Oh this place moved didn't it, I hope it tastes as good as it did." My family went to the original location for years. It's my sister's go-to place for great seafood and Chinese/Vietnamese fare. This location is larger and the wait still sucks, for those who arrive late that is. We've learned throughout the years and arrived at 5PM. You can't feed Asian people fast enough! My craving for dungeness crab caused me to talk about it so much my sister automatically suggested this place for my birthday dinner. So ten adults and three children sit down for some excellent food. All I cared about was the salt and pepper and the curry dungeness crab dishes. Except for an occasional distraction coming from my nephew, I was heads down cracking the claws, legs, and body of the unfortunate crabs. Like a ravenous canine I bit, licked, chewed, and sucked the sweet, sweet crab meat to my heart's content. Other dishes include hot and sour soup with shrimp, walnut shrimp, sauteed clams with black bean sauce, kong pao chicken, whole fried salt and pepper sole fish, fried tofu, rice noodles with chicken, beef loc lac (salt and pepper beef), and sauteed chinese broccoli. All the food was delicious. The employees really work hard to get you what you want here. 蔍 never had a problem with the service. 蔜hey will gladly grab you a beer with a smile and refill your water without asking. 蔄nything else you need, just ask and it gets there in a timely manner. 蔍 have dealt with many Chinese places where you feel so bad asking for anything and the employees make you feel rushed. The meal was so good I napped for two hours afterwards like an old ass bastard.

Nothing different to report here from the other great Yelp reviews! May I just add that the House Special Lobster was reported in Los Angeles' Magazine as one of the 99 things to eat in L.A. before you die, and I do agree, it was amazing! Our wait for a Saturday night was about 45 minutes, but once the gf spoke Vietnamese to the owner manning the hostess table, she promptly grabbed a couple Tsing Taos for my buddy and I to drink while we waited for our table! In addition, they sat our table of four in one of the back rooms that easily sits 10-12. I guess it pays to know the language! Again, the House Special Lobster (medium size - 5 or 6 lbs) is, in fact, to die for. Honey walnut shrimp, pork friend rice, mussels and some greens (I could've gone without the veggies, but the gf likes them for some reason) and we were set! We thought we were gonna have some leftovers, but the food was so good we continued to stuff ourselves until closing time. So, we proceeded to order some pork fried rice to go! Haha! Highly recommended!

Coincidentally I had almost the exact same meal 2x in 1 week, here and also at Seafood Cove in Westminster. But Newport Seafood was much much better! My favorite dish was the fried tofu and also the clams. House special lobster was also really great. We also ordered the pea sprouts and they asked if we'd like the leaves big or small. I order this dish often and have never had that option before. We chose small and they were very thin and fresh. Much different than I've had at other restaurants!

Came for dinner and managed to beat the dinner crowd so we were seated fairly quickly. We had the $28 family meal which includes the cat fish hot & sour soup, black bean clams, kung pao chicken, and sauteed peasprout. We also ordered a small lobster. The soup wasn't very good. There were large pieces of catfish and plenty (too much) of pineapple and okra. I thought it would be better considering all of the rave reviews but I was disappointed. All of the other dishes were good. The kung pao chicken (which I normally wouldn't order) was actually my favorite dish. This was plenty of food for 4 people and the total came out to be about $100.

I've only gone for the lunch specials so that i can only speak on the food during lunch. 蔋onestly their to go portion for some reason seem larger than when it get the portion during the seat down. 蔍 am assuming it is because they expect you to order multiple dishes when you sit down, which is pretty awesome for larger parties. You order ten dishes for about about ten people and you get to try alot of their dishes. 蔖ersonally i really like their spicy pepper pork chops and basil fish.

I chose this place to celebrate my bday. It's a great place to dine. I could have gone to many closer chinese restaurants near home, but I wanted to experience the setting as well as the food with my guests for the evening. Plus, the overall Yelp reviews stood out! 蔍 LOVE the decor at this restaurant and it is very nice. Yet, I am rating it a 3 star based on the extremely SLOW service. There were many hosts that were not occupied doing anything that took their time to pace around without asking our table if we would like any water, ask if we would like to order, clear some of the table for some clearance. Everything had to be asked by getting someone's attention. No refills on water or tea. I am very patient when it comes to service, but this was unreal. Newport Tan Cang has the appearance of upper scale. Yet, this is what they have lacked in. Food was good. I recommend the Bo Luc Lac and the large leaf pea sprout & the "house special" lobster is good, not great. Next time I have to get it spicy. Although, the service was poor. I would return with if service improves. Everything else food and restaurant is a 4(food) to 4.5 star(ambiance.)

After going through a series of disappointments dining in Old Town Pasadena, my homie Tony Y. Jr. and I decided to give this place a try. The place was heavily favored on Yelp by a predominant Asian crowd, but the exterior resemblance of a diner had my skepticism running abound. The place has a large parking lot and equally spacious interior with super-sized, clean fish and lobster tanks by the front door. There was also a nice waiting area with a cute Chinese-centric d巆or that was appropriate for fine dining and even a mini banquet. The well lit ambiance with family-style dining infused a sense of warmth and cultural authenticity into this place. To my delight, they also had a huge boba listing on their table with an array of flavors, including taro. Their nice looking Chinese menu has the influence of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Thai. Our house assorted seafood soup (9.45) came with a light broth filled with fish balls, shrimps, calamari, and cabbage. The servings of seafood were generous and the broth was light and flavorful. Even though the soup was pretty good, it was also something that was easy to find in a good Chinese restaurant. We also shared the Vietnamese French style beef ($11.95) which arrived with thick chunky tender steak cubes perfectly seasoned with a side salt and pepper for casual dipping. I usually like my steak medium rare, but this dish sizzled as the soft beef texture was well tenderized while its natural flavors were rich and robust. Even though I've had better ones at Le Cheval, but the dish was still outstanding, cheaper with a larger portion. The highlight of our dinner was marked by a fresh 4 pound lobster stir fried with ginger, garlic, and scallion ($15.95 per pound). The lobster was beautifully presented from head to tail, and the taste was very flavorful on the greasy side. Even though the flavor was present, I wished the lobster could be more meaty and I was somewhat disappointed with the failed search for its eggs. Lastly, we tried their Vietnamese water spinach which was not listed on their menu. The water spinach was fresh but I also thought it was a bit over-fried for which it could have been better if the texture was firmer with a savory dipping sauce. For the first time, I found myself at a place in LA where they use real fruit in their boba drinks. This is a significant discovery since I consider myself a boba freak by nature. My taro boba ($2.50) was pretty decent with a nice serving of boba but the essence of taro was too weak for it to be considered the best of the best. In all, there were some major hits and minor misses in this Vietnamese-Chinese dining experience. I really enjoy all the positive attributes of the ambiance and food, and find their service pleasant, quick, knowledgeable and very attentive. Solid 4.5 stars for the overall experience. I would absolutely love to come back again!

My 400th review! Of course, it has to be a Chinese place! ------ Wow, this is an OG Chinese restaurant! I've been hearing so much about how good the lobster here is, so I finally got a chance to coerce my friend to come with. We showed up at 6 pm and started ordering food like crazy women. The lobster was too pricey for the 2 of us since we wanted to stay under $50 for dinner, but we were able to order 3 dishes that were quite good. First up, the french style beef. This came highly recommended by a few people, so I couldn't pass it up. Chunk of beef, stir fried with some awesome sauce, sitting on top of lettuce, onions and tomatoes. It came with a side of lime juice/sauce which was superb. For an extra kick, eat the beef with some onion. Flavor explosion! Just don't go make out with anyone afterwards. Stir fried Chinese broccoli with dried fish was next. It was very good, and I liked the big chunks of garlic mixed in with the sauce. OMG. I love garlic anything! Great dish, and healthy too. Veggies rule! Our final course, the steamed flounder took about 15 minutes to arrive. It was $22.95, much cheaper than the cod at $15/lb. Anyway, the flounder was very tasty, with thinly sliced scallions on top and sitting on top of some soy based sauce. We killed that fish like hungry cats, but were not into the fish eggs in the belly of the fish. Ewww, gross. Overall, a great Chinese restaurant! By the time we left, there was a bunch of people waiting for tables! And 99.9% of them were Asian. You know this is an authentic place when Asians line up and wait! Service was up to par, actually, better than expected. I'd like to come back and try the clams and lobster. Maybe when I have more funds. PIX- http://pandaliciousforme�###Katie g.

Oh wait I love your food but despise the price I pay and the feeling I get when I see that the plate is empty! **sobs** lol At first I thought you left me because I haven't been paying attention to you but I am glad to see that you just went to your parent's house. 蔣ou packed your bags and moved down the street to a bigger location, which is now the mothership. 蔈ven in this bigger location you still don't have time for me. 蔣ou open yourself to everyone else and cheat on me! I thought we had something special going on! At least you have changed and started accepting credit cards! I am glad I don't have to leave the money on the nightstand any more! At least now I get something back for spending so much on you ^_- Now onto how good you are... You melt in my mouth... the House Special Lobster dish you serve is simply FABULOUS! Of course I pay the price...at $16 a lb... you ain't cheap! lol I can site there and eat 6lbs of you easily... but crying at the same time with tears of joy when I see you and eat you, but tears of sadness when I see that there is no more left and then huge sobs when I get the bill! lol For lunch they have great deals but when you add the almighty lobster... man the bill is hefty! lol I took my friend here the first time and she fell in love with it! She has been dreaming about it for forever! So for her bday I took her. 蔜he bill came out to be $110, I think without tip. 蔠e only had 3 dishes... 2 lunches and 1 lobster with some slushies... I love that they serve Durian smoothies but they are really slow about bringing them out nowadays The lobster emanates and resonates your senses. 蔍 can't stop drooling when they bring it out and rip into it like I have been dying of starvation. 蔜he light batter on the outside that is stir-fried to perfection with scallions, garlic, ginger and more! I'd die for you!!!!! lol I have had their crab special but it is nowhere near as good as the lobster. 蔍t's just very peppery. �I can't ever leave you regardless of how much you cost. 蔍 am forever yours! I will always wait for you! ^_-

THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST CHINESE/VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT THAT IS CHEAP AND QUICK WITH SUPER FAST SERVICE AND FRIENDLY STAFF!!! Best time to go is lunch time Monday-Friday where they have lunch specials from $5-$6.50 a plate. They give you hot and sour soup, white rice, and hot tea automatically. They serve BIG portions and believe me, the wait is worth it if there is one. I usually go around 11 when they first open or around 1-2 when lunch is mellowing out. Usually no wait around those times =) Definitely a must go place for chinese food =)

Get here right at opening on a Sunday (11:30am) after a late Saturday night.. It'll be crowded fast. The lobster and the beef plate are perfect for filling your belly and absolving yourself of any hangover inducing previous night of drinking. Be prepared to get a little messy - it's difficult to get to all of the lobster meat with chopsticks, but it's well worth the endeavor. If you need extra napkins, don't worry; there is a big stack in the drawer on the side of your table. You can find extra plates for the cracked lobster shell there as well. If the food was healthier - less sugar in the sauces and seasonings - this would be a 5star place... but you really can't take the special sauce away and expect the same results, can you? Luckily the green tea is perfect for washing it down and waking you up from the food coma.

3 day holiday weekend, but with only one day off...I'm looking at a yelper gf's photos with amazing crawfish (which I've never had) 蔭nd crabs. 蔍 must have those, now....I thought. I google map a crawfish place and it esimates a 45 minute drive time to Westminster, probably more with the holiday traffic....not reasonable just to fulfill a craving. 蔍 yelp more places and find a place...40 plus reviews, mostly 5 stars. 蔄 30 mile drive....but WTH, I have to labor tomorrow on labor day so I gathered my clan (mom and kids). Ahh, so this is ghetto vietnamese. And this is what they eat? 蔊ood stuff. 蔍 was impressed ....the patrons were all vietnamese. (coming from a Japanese girl who grew up in then non-ethnic Santa Monica thinking she's white/Jewish) 蔍 skimmed the reviews before leaving home and they all seemed to mention lobster....so I made sure I ordered that first. Plus crabs Salt and pepper fried shrimps with lime �Steamed mussels Steamed fish Deep fried fish all of the above (except shrimp) were without prices..labeled 'seasonal' and shrimp chow mein white steamed rice Uh, frog legs? �They had half a page of them on the menu cooked in different sauces. 蔖ass. I like tongue, brain, most organs, tripe - Trippa alla Romana - YUM!, escargots, cat's eyes , veal intestine with half digested milk in Italy ... most stuff that gross other people out but....I just can't do frog legs. Let me take one thing back, I DO NOT like any eyes. 蔍 was tricked into the cat's eyes when I was a child and visiting Hong Kong....and I will also never eat dog, monkey 's brain etc..... Ooops, sorry...now I can go on and on with a list of stuff I cannot eat besides frog's legs. 蔠e"ll save that for another time.... The brain I mentioned I liked above was sheep. And the Tongue I enjoy is..... cow's. �I realize now that I overdid it with the seafood. 蔅ut the waiter suggested all of the above and I listened. Now I've read the reviews again and regret not ordering the beef, soup, and chicken that everybody mentioned.....just for variety's sake. I also missed the cash only warnings. The total was $170. 蔜he lobster alone was $70. Luckily I had exactly $200 cash in my wallet. 蔠hew, I didn't have to wash the dishes. Well, I seem to be the only person in yelpland who has never had pho (no, i don't count Pho 99 in West L.A. ) so it was interesting to be in a chinese/vietnamese neighborhood, with pho places everywhere. 蔍t was exactly 40 degrees hotter than in Santa Monica. �15?! 蔍t felt 蔿ike the surface of the sun! 5pm on a Saturday, I found parking easily and there was no wait. By the time we were leaving though, there was a huge crowd waiting outside. Lack of one star for noisy, no ambience/decor, AND, they actually forgot to bring the mussels, and brought my Tsing tao beer at the end of the meal... A place to come with family or friends.....no, 蕁ot a first date place. Lastly, 蔍 only have myself to blame for lack of research on what to order....but seafood overkill! �and I ordered too much, thank god they forgot the mussels....I'll be eating leftovers tomorrow...) Yes I should have ordered the bo luc lac (beef) 蕋hat all reviewers raved about. The crab and lobster house special came with identical sauces so it was hard to tell which was which after a while. �I love lobster, but I could've done without it and the crab was much better. 蔠ill post pics later.

Monstrous Alaskan King Crabs, humongous lobsters, and Giant Clams! �蔔ewport's signature niche is their live seafood that is simmered with a special sauce - a concoction of garlic, butter, and chili. ��You will be licking your fingers clean! 蔇electable. Note: I've only been here for dinner a few times for special occasions. �This newer location is much nicer than the older one a few blocks down the street. �As soon as you enter, you will see the huge tank of Alaskan King Crabs. 蔎ust for kicks, I like to name 'The Chosen One' before I eat him. �蔜he last one's name was: 蔠ilbur. ���Newport is known for their seafood, so I would suggest sticking with that and straying away from ordering dishes that don't flow through the kitchen frequently. 蔵e: �beef chow mein or beef and broccoli. ��蔣ou might see the waiters smirk like they are thinking, "ok sucka!" if you order those items. �Service has been pleasant with my dining at Newport Seafood. 蔜hey are attentive and gregarious. �* Use discretion when ordering. 蔖rices can get expensive when ordering fresh, seafood. �My favorite is the King Crab and that goes for about $25-$28/ lbs. �and since the crabs are huge, one can cost up to $200. �蔅ut don't let that scare you away. �It's worth every bite. �** If you are going to attend another event after dinner, bring a change of clothes, because you will reek of simmered garlic butter when you leave the restaurant. �Just a couple tips from your boy, Lance. ��蔆heers~!

Came here with my bf and his family. The decor is oh so Hong Kong, makes me kinda wish I could vacay there. When we were about to arrive, I was thinking wtf when was there a restaurant here? Looks kinda of deserted and ghetto-ish. I mean it was practically the only restaurant there. We had a big group of people and the hostess led us to a private room. Not really a room but it was sectioned off with red dividers. The service was great. Our server was giving us recommendations after recommendations. He was always there when we needed him even though it was super busy. The food was pretty good. We started with some shrimps. Had the stirred fried string beans, the lobster chow mein, stirred fried clams. We got 2 huge fried fish and some other dishes, too many to list. Everything was very yummy and the portion was quite generous. Ever since I've been there, I've been meaning to go back and bring my family, so they won't be jealous lol. And I still don't see how the name Tan Cang translates into it's Chinese name, anyone knows? It's been bothering me for months hahah

I love everything here. 蔜he crab, lobster, calamari, fried rice, beef... everything. 蔈verything. �Come - you won't regret it. 蔜he only down side is it seems everyone and their 10-person family comes at the same time as I do and they seem to automatically tell people it's a 1 hour wait. 蔛o, it can get really busy and would recommend coming off-peak hours or during the week. 蔛till, it's worth the wait because everything just tastes so damn good. 蔖lus, once you place your order it literally seems like 2 minutes go by and they're back with your food. 蔍'm so glad I live nearby! If you have trouble finding a spot in their small parking lot, try street parking in the neighborhoods nearby & walking over. 蔣ou can also opt to bring your own alcohol as they don't carry a very wide selection.

I have the cast of The Little Mermaid in my belly! Lobster Lobster Lobster!!! 蔍f you're baller enough to drop some Jacksons, the lobster is defintely worth it. 蔍t was so succlent and the seasoning they use to pan fry it was finger licking good. The crab was delicious too. 蔔ormally I would pass on crab because I think it's 蕋oo much work for so little pay off, but the seasoning they used is like crack. 蔍'm sure it was coated in MSG, but it wouldn't be authentic Chinese if it wasn't I highly reccomend getting the prix fixed menu because you get all of their best dishes. �Clams, pea sprouts, kung pao chicken, etc. If you get here no later than 6:30, you'll have no problem getting a table for a large group. 蔄ny later than 6:30, your looking at an hours wait. 蔍 would definitely wait an hour though. 蔜he food is so good. The service as well was ridiculously good. 蔍 grew up eating at Chinese restaurants and was amzaed at how speedy and attentive the waiters were. I'm still in a food coma from this meal.

In celebration of the birth of the woman that brought my sister and I into this world, we brought my wonderful mother to Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant--since seafood is her favorite especially lobster. 蔊reat reviews from the Yelp Community led us to pick this for our mother ... thanks, guys! Service - Excellent customer service - seated promptly and very attentive. Cleanliness - Immaculate Price - approx. $150.00 prior to tip Seafood - Lobster, crab, clams, abalone, sea cucumber, frog, etc Meats - Beef, chicken, pork Dessert - n/a Fruits - n/a Other - ample parking; if you can, try to get one of the booths, it'll be less noisy. What was ordered: House Assorted Seafood Soup (10.95) - this soup contained napa cabbage, snap peas, shrimp, baby squid, and bits and pieces of beef. 蔕MG ... the broth was amazing--I literally felt soothed after drinking it like all my problems just oozed away. 蔍 especially love the vegetables in the soup--it was so tender and infused with the flavors of the broth. Clam w/ Spicy Sauce (10.95) - saut巈d clams in basil sauce w/ garlic and ginger. 蔍f you ask any of my ex's, they'll tell you that is John's O-face. 蔒y face would totally be able to tell you what's going on in my mouth--okay, maybe this is bad dinner table conversation. 蔄nyways, this is an awesome dish because I love clams and basil. 蔅asil is so aromatic and flavorful which makes the clams taste even better than they are. 蔍 can understand why many culinary authors consider basil the "king of herbs." 蔕h, Newport gives you good portion clams too--a lot of meat in those bivalves. 蔒y mom is a fiend for leftover sauces ... she liked the sauce so much she asked them to wrap it up so she can take it home (how embarrassing, but it's her birthday). Beef Loc Lac (French Style) (11.95) - filet mignon beef sitting on a bed of rice, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. 蔜he filet mignon was cooked to perfection and extremely flavorful, moist, and almost buttery at each bite. 蔜he texture of the meat was so soft like a marshmallow. 蔜his is definitely a must get!! Fried Pork Chop w/ Salt & Pepper (9.95) - perfectly crispy, golden pork chops served with a dish of salt/ pepper and lime. 蔜hese pork chops did not need the salt/pepper and lime ... yes, it was that savory. 蔜he meat (1) not overly fried so it was soft and crispy, (2) meat was tender and moist, (3) mouth-watering taste. 蔍'm pretty sure they hand pick the pork chops because each chop had a good deal of meat on it--I hate places where there is more bone than meat. Newport Special Lobster (seasonal price, 75.75) - beautifully cooked � lb to 6 lb lobster dressed in chopped scallions. 蔜he waiter that brought this dish was quite proud--walked up to the table, presented it like it was a million bucks, looked at each of us, gave us a grin that said "Ugggggh, how you like me now, beyotches!" (this according to my sister and her boyfriend T). 蔜his lobster was scrumptious--perfectly seasoned and cooked. 蔜he sauce used didn't overpower the natural lobster taste and, of course, the meat was soft and buttery. �Sauteed Peasprouts (9.25) - saut巈d peasprouts cooked with ginger, garlic, and sesame oil. 蔒y sister and I love this stuff!! 蔎ust the smell alone makes my mouth drool ... damn, now I have to dry clean that. 蔍'm pretty sure everyone had 3 to 4 servings of the stuff. 蔎ust get it, it's good for the colon ; ) House Special Fried Rice (6.95) - contained eggs, beef, bean sprouts, peas, shrimp, onions, scallions, and garlic. 蔜his fried rice was good. 蔍 would give it higher points because the rice was fluffy--I hate fried rice when the rice is greasy. Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant definitely deserve 5 star marks in my book--our tummies were indeed happy and most importantly ... so was my mom. 蔍'm dedicating this review to the one who brought us into the world, fed us, clothed us, taught us the ways of the world, found some way to afford the stupid little things kids want, and loved us ... I love you mom and Happy Birthday (just ignore the O-face comment above).

Clam with Spicy Hot Sauce: 蔵t wasn't hot at all but I did like the clam. 蔍 am not a fan of clam but I enjoyed this dish. � stars. Bo Luc Lac: 蕁ot too bad. �.5 stars. Deep Fried Tofu: 蔜ofu is bland so you need sauce or meat to make it yummy. 蔜he sauce didn't do it for me. � stars. Sauteed Peasprout: 蔍 like peasprout. �.5 stars. 3 stars for Newport Tan Cang. 蔜he oranges they gave us for dessert was sweet. 蔛ervice was great too. 蔕kay I will bump it to 3.5 stars. Tan Cang is yummylicious!!

In celebration of procrastination Monday, a rhyme! We pulled up to the parking lot, At 630pm on the dot. It was full of vietnamese mobster but I don't care I came for lobster. The line was crazy off the heezys There were lots of hot asian beezies. Sat down when food was already out, we digged in without a doubt. The beef was so tender, it does not make me slender. The clams were so delicious, the greens were nutritious. �Then the holy plate came before us The lobster was enormous The fish was cooked two ways, It was heavenly and left me in a daze. Hopefully, it was informative and slightly enjoyable. P.S. My review is for the new location which is not the location in the pictures, which I don't know why they consolidated this review with the other one. 蔅ut the address is correct. 蔜he pictures show the dingier one @ 835 Las Tunas.

I finally had a chance to try this restaurant recently. 蔄fter getting lost before and this time around, I finally found it. This is across the street from the Mitsuwa market! 蔍ts a lot closer to Alhambra than it is to San Gabriel. Parking is tough since the parking lot is small and this restaurant is very popular. 蔠e found parking on the street. 蔎ust be careful where you park so you don't get a ticket. For a Sunday evening, party of 7, the wait was 45 minutes. 蔛o make sure to arrive early. 蔜he restaurant is a lot smaller than I had originally thought it would be. �I love how they have pre-set combos. It was so hard to choose so we ended up getting the combo for $68 and added 3 additional dishes. 蔠e had 9 dishes altogether. 1. Fried whole crab with garlic, jalapeno, & salt was pretty good. �2. Vietnamese Catfish soup was good. It tasted almost as good as my mom. 蔒y mom liked it better than the one at Phong Dinh. I agree with her on that. 3. Stir fried clams were ok. 4. Stir fried pea sprouts were ok. 5. 蔛alt & Pepper Pork Chop were decent 6. Beef loc lac was good. It was one of my favorite dish there along with the Catfish soup. 7. Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good. 8. Steam fish was ok 9. Stir fried fish with basil was ok I thought many of the dishes were a bit bland for my taste and it was a tad oily. 蔍ts great for my mom who has to watch her salt intake but disappointing for me since I've been wanting to try this restaurant for so long. 蔜hus, the hype did not live up to my expectations. Servers and waiters were very efficient and fast. 蔜hey work collectively as a group to take care of all the patrons. The food comes out fast. 蔠e did not wait the full 45 minutes. It also has better ambience than most Asian Restaurants.

I was not let down at all by our meal here and for the price for six, it was a deal too! Deep fried whole shrimp, seasoned with salt and pepper was one of my favorite dishes of the day. You have to love biting their heads off. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�A randomly ordered noodle dish was pretty tasty but nothing to write home about. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�The beef loc lac was so good that we ordered two plates of it. Very tender and very flavorful sauce, I would have loved this in a sandwich. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�To add something resembling healthy, we ordered some fried tofu. It was very good and very hot inside! The sauce it came with match nicely. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�Everyone here comes for the lobster of course and we ordered a medium sized one. I was very surprised how tender the flesh was and how well it was cooked! None of it was rubbery or overly chewy. The sauce that covered the shells and meat was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_�To round out the meal, we ordered the house special whole fish. It was great! http://www.yelp.com/biz_�Since we went at 2pm, there was no line and no wait. I suggest eating at an off time to avoid any potential wait.

UPDATED - 11.18.08 dang.....i must have been smoking some really good (fill in the blank here) last night when i wrote a FTR for the new location. 蔵 had the address wrong. 蕇eriously. 蕀y bad. 蕇o here's my review in the right spot. 蔭nd if you UFC'd me yesterday...thanks! 蔯an you do it here, too? 蔰ouble thanks!! �) this one is...............twice as large with the same food and servers. it has it's own private parking lot, which is way more convenient. it's directly across the street from mitsuwa and also across the street from the san gabriel hospital. (ugh...) i discovered a new dish i like: the salt & pepper squid ($9.95). perfectly fried without a lot of batter. the beef loclac ($11.95) is always a must. 蔮lack pepper beef cubes cooked to a perfect medium rare. the fried tofu ($9.25) is also fried perfectly. make your parents proud and order a veggie.....we got the ong choy ($10.95). it was cooked too soggy for me tonight. and don't forget the lobster ($15.99/pound tonight). a medium 5.5lb lobster fed 2 girls and 3 big boys. 蕋he lobster was crappy tonight though. 蕋oo many hard to eat pieces with not a lot of meat in them. their decor is.....modern chinese. so weird that this used to be the marie callendars. poor marie callendars. i grew up buying my pies here! they were surprisingly busy for a monday night. service could've been a bit better (they were slow changing our plates). even for a chinese place, my plates used to always get changed promptly here. the old location was definitely more old school chinese, but as the times change and these places make more money, i guess they'll all start to look like this. i just prefer the old style. every place has their good days and bad days, so i'm still giving them 5 stars. 蔵 was stuffed beyond belief, but still found room to have dessert at phoenix down the street. and yes, i took the receipt home just so i could write all the prices and get the names of the dishes right. see what a helpful yelper i am? :D

Besides sushi, I wouldn't say I'm the biggest fan of seafood. 蔅ut man-oh-man the way they make their lobster here is indescribable! �They make the lobster with just the right amount of sauce so that it doesn't overpower the taste of the heavenly lobster, and it's oh so good I don't even mind that I have to dig through a pound of shell just to get to it! And oh, don't forget about the crab! 蔄nd the clams in basil.... drooolll... I came here just last night with my family and I've been there twice within the last month! 蔍t's such a fun place to take guests or family for a special occasion... and even more fun for people who have never had chinese seafood before! 蔣ou get to watch them stare helplessly at the fish that still actually looks like a fish, and the crab that's been untouched and uncracked like... how am I supposed to eat this?!? The shrimp and walnuts looked soooooooo goood tooo.... basically everything on the menu is good. 蔈xcept their boba, which is understandably mediocre. 蔜hey've got more important matters to attend to! �I love coming here, and although the price is sky high (it's seafood) and the wait is hours long on a sunday night (ok like 45 minutes), it's sooo worth it! I hope I can afford to come back here again, soon!!! You've gotta try this place!

The family was in the mood for some lobster and decided to make the drive for some goodness. We made sure we got there early to avoid the wait and horrible parking situation. If the lot if full you can go around the corner and find street parking. Plenty. The restaurant looked clean for a Chinese restaurant but I must warn you about the floors. I think it's the material they use for the floor because it's slippery! I've been there multiple times and I would slip and catch myself at least once throughout the meal. So watch out! Let's talk food. We ordered cat fish with hot and sour soup, lobster, and steamed cod. The soup was brought out first and it was great. There were a lot bean sprouts, taro stem (elephant ears), tomatoes, basil, pineapples, and chunks of cat fish. The soup was hot and had a good amount of spicy and sour taste. Our lobster was perfect. The meat had a bite and wasn't chewy. The flavor was peppery and delicious. I was only able to have a couple because it felt too greasy and heavy. I really enjoyed the steamed fish. Steamed, simple, and topped with soy sauce and green onions. I like the simplicity of steamed fish because there aren't any sauces that takes away from the clean and freshness of the fish. The meal was good and very filling which means a happy family. The service was great. They kept refilling out water and changed our plates when the lobster shells started to accumulate. I will definitely come back for a lobster fixing.

I played a four-player game last night that involved skill, strategy and calculation. No, I was not playing mahjong, but a game called Get the Most Meat out of Your Lobster. GMMYL. GMMYL was a thrilling game. Not only was it completely satisfying it was scrumptious, flavorful and full of competition. Who would get the most meat? Who would eat the head (FRANK K.)? Who would have the dirtiest fingers?! :o GMMYL was a great meal. I could have gone without the shoving, pulling and picking, but it is lobster after all. It didn't run my wallet too deep. 5 pounds of lobster for $40 each (including tax and tip) with three additional dishes. A great fun-food evening with new friends, great eats and a great game of GMMYL. Not too shabby if you ask me. :)

i feel like i owe Newport a review since i go there so often that most of the waiters start to know my name. I will give the food 4 stars. Most of everything I've ordered came out to be good, such as Walnut shrimp, french style beef cubes, salt and pepper shrimps, basil fish filet, beef stew, sauteed bean sprouts, pork chops, clams (they must have cleaned their clams before cooking because the clams do not have sands inside! Big PLUS!) and of course lobsters. Everything that's needed to be said about lobsters and other dishes has already been said. So I don't feel like repeating. I will talk about something else. What makes me keep on going back to Newport is not just the food, it is the superb customer service that they provide there. (Note: I have vouched never going back to some pretty tasty restaurants because of their HORRIBLE service.) Every time I go there, the waiters will always come say Hi, make small talks if im waiting for my friends/coworkers, ask me if i need anything. They make me feel so welcome! You don't find this kind of customer service in any other Asian restaurants, maybe in Sea Harbor (my other favorite). 蔊ood food + Excellent Service = Sasha eats at Newport every week=no more moolah in her wallet when Christmas comes. If you like/want to try Chinese food and want to have a good experience, please go nowhere else but Newport. You will not regret it in most cases, unless you come during a really busy day for dinner and have to wait 2-3 hours. In that case, I do not want to guarantee anything. :)

It's not often an authentic Mandarin restaurant delivers both good atmosphere and food. In their new location, Newport Tan Cang has really upped their game. Normally I wouldn't comment on the atmosphere because as everyone knows when it comes to the Asian thing, I'm just in it for the food. But what a swank place for the SGV. The waiting area is fancy with its wooden walls, handsome floors and ample seating that consists of actual permanent bench seating...as opposed to the normal lot for these restaurants: extra chairs from the dining room that are often taken away from those sitting in them when needed. We dined on a Wednesday night after 7:00 p.m. and there was no wait at all. We ordered the following: Fried Tofu - crispy and tasty... good dipping sauce Salt and Pepper Squid ... a bit greasy, but in a good way. Plenty of flavor Beef loclac Beef Cubes - they were cooked exactly as we ordered them and were a perfect size to share among five people Ong Choy - crisp and very spinach like...just enough garlic (delicious!) And then there was the 6 LB lobster (oh the baby!) I have to admit, as a New Englander I'm finally getting used to lobster cooked in ways other than steamed. Chinese style lobster: it's greasy and messy, but oh so delicious. Newport Tan Cang doesn't over or under-spice and the meat wasn't at all gummy as it can be if overcooked. As another in my party mentioned, the lobster was a bit hard to eat than normal. What's important to understand is that lobster varies throughout the year...at some times of the year the shells are far more significant. I'm assuming this is one of those times. But really, that's just par for the lobster course.

This is definitely the place to come for Chinese-style Lobster. 蔍t's one of my favorite places if you want to celebrate with Chinese food. Although you can come with two people and order the lobster and maybe one other dish, you'll definitely have a lot of leftovers. Christina nailed the two most popular dishes - the House Special Lobster, which is fried with tons of green onions and chilis. 蔜he 2nd most famous dish is the House Special Beef (also in Christina's review), which is some of the tenderest beef I have ever had. If you come with 4-5 people, I'd also recommend the following: 1. 蔇eep fried tofu (very delicately flavored and incredibly soft pieces of tofu coated with a golden yellow, slight crispy, slightly chewy coating and served with a soy dipping sauce - they do it pretty well here 2. Clams with black bean sauce - their clams are high quality and black bean sauce might be a bit salty for some, but I find it tasty 3. 蔕ne green veggie - say pea sprouts (or spinach) sauteed with garlic If you have a larger appetite, you can add 4. 蔛oup - I am partial to the crab meat w/ asparagus soup, which has shreds of crab meat in a thick seafood broth. 蔣ou can add a dash of red vinegar or white pepper to this if you like. �5. 蔆an't go wrong with the white pepper porkchop - pretty much a staple at many places, but they do it well here. So if you do the above, you've got a lobster, a beef, a pork, a veggie, a tofu, and a soup - you've covered all the bases except poultry! Tip #1 - parking in this mini-mall can be a pain. 蔣ou will see a mirage of a few spaces in front of the 7 -11, but they are reserved for 7-11 customers. 蔛ave yourself some stress and park on one of the sidestreets bordering the mini-mall. 蔜he half block walk will be nice after the meal. Tip #2 - the lobster is so good that a lot of people take the green onion/chile mixture (sans lobster shells, hopefully) home and use it as a base for fried rice. 蔆heck it out - it's simple. 蔎ust heat up some olive oil in a wok or saute pan, fry the onion/chile mixture until fragrant, 蔭dd in some left-over rice, stir around, and Bam! 蔣ou have a tasty dish that will amaze your friends. 蔣ou can also add in a beaten egg if you want. 蔎ust make sure there aren't any bits of lobster shell in the mixture. 蔜hat's a crunch you definitely don't want to hear.

Took my long lost HK friend here since he is from the culinary waste land - NZ. Been planning the menu in my head all day. After much agonizing decision settled on the steamed flounder, vietnamese beef cubes (it is call French style on the menu) and clams as the appetizer. When I ordered clams with black bean sauce the waiter recommended instead their spicy clams in herbs. I am usually skeptical of waiter/waitress recommendation but tonight I went along with it. MAJOR SCORE.. it was incredible. The pungent chopped chilies paired with the aromatic herbs - OMG.. More important the clam meat was very plumb and juicy. Importante. That means the clams have not been starved in the water tank for too long. 蔜his is a 5. The shaken beef was very competent. Full of fresh black pepper corn goodness and strong notes of Maggie sauce. Close to one of the best but I have to give S. Vietnam's a slight edge. 蔜he meat being higher quality at S. The steamed fish was slightly disappointing. It was a large fish and came out in the perfect temperature but the meat does not have that fresh mouth feel. 蔜he soy based dressing was on the weak side and not enough rice wine fragrance. 蔜his is a 3. The bill was $47 and it could have fed 3-4 people. Kudos for bring the clam first and let us finished it before serving the next dish. I hate it a LOT when they bring it in random order or all at once. 蔛hould have brought out the fish next but the beef came instead. 蔜hey changed the plate quickly after we finished the clam. Points for service. 5 for the spicy clams 5 for value 4.5 for the beef cubes 3 for the fish I should have ordered the lobster but I thought 2 shell fish might be boring. So I went with the HK surf and turf with a Vietnamese flair. Update: I came before and ordered the crab, almost as fresh as those in Vancouver. The preparation is still a notch higher up there. The ginger and scallion is tasty but a little heavy or the steamed crab with a hint of rice wine are both recommended.

What to eat on a Sunday night after a 10 mile hike? How about going to Newport Tan and getting their $230 fixed course meal? 蔆heck! Now $230 prefixed course is a lot of food (i had 10 people in my party)... let me see if I can list all the dishes that came out Crab and Shark fin soup sea cucumber dish Combination fried rice Clams kung pao chicken/beef/shrimp Peasprouts Steamed fish BBQ pork chops Salt and pepper crab house lobster Every dish i had was exceptionally good.. well except the sea cucumber, it could have been good but I can't get myself to eat sea cucumber. 蔕bviously the lobster was my favorite dish but the others were not that far behind. 蔍 normally don't like kung pao dishes but I really liked it here Like many review before mine, be prepared to wait... especially if you come after 630. 蔍 got there for 6 and getting a table for a party of 10 was no problem but when I was walking out, the waiting room was packed out. The service is really friendly, almost too friendly. 蔠hen our lazy susan was too full, our waiter took our half eaten dishes and put it on a smaller plates. 蔜hey even came by several time to ask if we needed a plate change. 蔜he table next to mine was having a birthday celebration and the waiters were more than happy to take pictures for them. 蔍 even heard a waiter shout out "Sexy!"

came here once with my family when we visited our aunt who lives in LA. i would say the lobsters here are good, but not great, i've definitely had better lobsters somewhere else. we ordered the lobster, clams with jalapenos, sizzling beef, squid with basil, and this lemon seafood soup, i have to say, the best is probably the soup, it's lemony and very refreshing. but the clams dish has way too much sauce and the sauce is way gooey, it gets to you very quickly and not in a good way. lobster was tough, we specifically asked for a smaller one so it will be tender, but even with a 5lb lobster, it's still quite tough :( sizzling beef tastes only decent and nothing too special, and it's really really greasy, i feel like the beef was getting fried in a pool of oil. however, the squid with basil is very good. it's tender and and when you eat with the soy sauce/vinegar sauce on the bottom along with the basil leaves, it's like a flavor explosion in your mouth, very very delish! overall, i've had better chinese seafood in many other places in california, even in nor cal, i dont see why people hype about this one in LA :\

DELISH! 蔋ighly recommended - and do get their seafood since it's their specialty. The house special lobster was phenomenal :) We also tried the salt & pepper baked crab which was almost equally as good as the lobster. 蔄nd finally a whole steamed cod which was very flavorful. 蔕ne of the best meal I've ever had! 蔠ill definitely come back next time I go down to LA!! We came here on Thanksgiving day for lunch. We got there a little early before they opened so we crossed the street to Mitsuwa to kill time for 15 minutes, but when we came back we're already the 5th party there. 蔅y the time we finished our meal, the place was quite packed.

Surprisingly I have never been to this location of Newport Seafood. There were ones located in Santa Ana and Rowland Heights. I passed by here so often enough, I always wondered if I should stopped in for a quick bite. I knew a quick bite would be out of the question, but I was glad I had an opportunity to stop in when a birthday dinner was held here for a friend of ours. The place was big enough for about 20 tables and some of those were for big groups. However, there will be a long wait regardless because of the huge popularity for this place. Luckily we didn't wait that long because it is on a weeknight. I can imagine a nightmarish wait during the weekends. We got a chatty old fella as our waiter who can give us some pointers on what to order, but we pretty have a good idea in mind which dishes to order. We were planning on ordering some crabs, but they ran out which we had to "settle" for the ever popular lobster. On a previous occasion at Santa Ana, we had over-ordered lobsters where it can be damaging at a cost of $15-$18 per pound depending on the rate of the time. It rocked us at the time for $160 for each large lobster. So with that in mind, we went conservative on the approach and order about three items and will order more if needed. We started off with the popular dish of the restaurant, the lobster http://www.yelp.com/biz_�. If there was anything you had to order, it would have to be this dish. I didn't really know why we were considering crabs, but I think it was just to get a change of pace, but I'm so glad we got this again instead. This is a thing of beauty where the six of us just devoured this thing in a puff of hurry. It was gone and we were sucking it dry from the shell. My personal favorite is the Bo Luc Lac (marinated beef cubes) http://www.yelp.com/biz_�. With a great seasoning and some tangy lime, it almost like a sculling beef melting in your mouth. I still honestly never gotten a better Bo luc lac anywhere else but here. It usually would be dry or too well done cooked, but at this place, it always spot on. That is maybe why I like going to Newport Seafood restaurants just for the beef. The Mayonnaise Shrimps with walnuts http://www.yelp.com/biz_�are awesome too. If the mayonnaise is too fattening for you, then you just don't know how to live it up. Seriously, this is a killer of an item that you have to get a taste of. Forget those so called slippery shrimps you have heard or have seen elsewhere, this place has the best mayonnaise shrimps. After the three spectacularly delicious dish, we actually have more room for more food. So we decided that it would be best if we can ordered something else. The waiter suggested to us to get the Oyster with Green and Red Pepper http://www.yelp.com/biz_�. To be honest, it was ho hum compared to the other, but the oyster was actually tasted very nicely cooked. A bit oily for my taste, plus I would have enjoyed it raw or cooked in a Taiwanese style peppered soup with ginger. The oyster was not bad and seasoned well, but I guess it was not superb like the other dishes. Overall it was a very good feast and a place I would always look forward to going. The waiter was promised to sing a happy birthday song in Cantonese. What a tease in that he didn't go through. Otherwise the whole night would have been memorable like the food. --------- BTW, here's a key on this one. Even though it can be really expensive where the lobster can killed your wallet with upwards of over $100 if you are not careful. It's CASH ONLY at this place. So make sure you bring in plenty of cash before you step in.

ROCK LOBSTER! (Sorry, couldn't help the Family Guy reference). Came here for lunch today for the house special lobster. Arrived around 1pm and it wasn't too busy. We ordered a small lobster (3.25 lbs) which came out to around $16 a pound. It was more than enough for two people. The lobster was perfectly cooked and seasoned with generous amounts of black pepper and green onions. It looked like it would be spicy, but it wasn't at all. I still can't believe how well the lobster was cooked. They cut the lobster into more manageable pieces, but you still have to do a little bit of work to get the lobster meat out of the shell. Totally worth it. We also ordered the clams in black bean sauce and Chinese broccoli off their lunch menu. The clams were just okay. It should be noted that they use the larger clams here. The Chinese broccoli was cooked very well I might add. They really make it a point to give you more of the leaves than the stems. Ended up ordering too much food for two people, but I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers later!

BEWARE!!!! WE WERE RIPPED OFF MAJORLY! 蔠e had an extremely unfortunate experience tonight. 蔕ur waiter basically misled us and lied to us regarding the price of their special king crab. 蔅e really careful of these waiters - they really want to milk you. This was our first time at this restaurant and my parents and I go to many different Asian restaurants in the area. 蔕ur waiter recommended all these dishes, especially their King Crab. 蔠e were told that one pound cost $29. 蔒y mother asked how big the whole dish was and that if it was 2 pounds, we'd take it. 蔜he waiter said Yes that it was only 2 pounds and kept reassuring us that it wouldn't be too big. 蔠e told our waiter that we didn't want to spend too much tonight. 蔋e told us not to worry at all. Our crab comes. 蔍t's big, it was alright (not the best - seafood village in monterey park is way better), but because it was so big we asked if this was the right crab. 蔠e couldn't tell what the weight was because they added all these other things to the crab (like vegetables, other flourishes etc). 蔕ur waiter said yes it was the right crab. The bill comes. 蔜he amount is $245. 蔋OLY CRAP! 蔠e find out that they billed us six pounds of crab!!! 蔠e asked the waiter what happened. 蔋e kept saying how sorry he was, but didn't lower the price and just made us pay the whole amount. 蔠e told him that he should have told us that the crab was so large and was a much bigger size than we had wanted - he could have warned us but he didn't! 蔋e kept saying sorry but to pay the bill. We paid, didn't leave a tip, and we'll never return. 蔣ou cannot treat customers that way and mislead people. 蔜his is a tough financial time for many of us, and I didn't think it was right for the restaurant to betray our trust that way. 蔜o make it worse, this place doesn't even accept credit cards! 蔜hank god we had enough cash.

Well not sure how to tackle this one because everyone else has commented on this restaurant as well. 蔅ut as usual, I'll try to focus on all the little things that I like about it. �This is rated one of the highest in the SG valley. 蔄nd, rightfully so. You can't beat the lunch-time rates, quality and quantity. �The hot 'n' sour soup is always pretty starchy, but I always look forward to having it - don't forget to add in about 10 shakes of the white pepper to give it a real kick in the arse. �This place has by far - hands down (well I guess up) the best kung-pao chicken and beef around. 蔍t's more Vietnamese-crispy style rather than the Hong Kong saucy-style. 蔎ust great stuff. 蔜he pea sprouts are top notch as well. 蔛o if you order any of these dishes you just can't go wrong. �Everyone has talked about the lobster so nuff said on that. �Service is always quick. 蔄nd, don't mind the older guy with glasses that is always trying to push those boba drinks on you. 蔎ust stick with the hot tea and keep it a cheap eat. 蔍 mean you can have 5 people join you in a group and order till you're stuffed and it will come out to be around $6 - $7 bucks a person. 蔎ust can't beat that can you?? If you get the take-out, they have stopped using the Styrofoam containers and have changed to the plastic microwave-style containers. 蔕rder enough take-out and you'll have a cupboard full of lunch containers for those who pack their lunch to work/school/or play.

OMG! OMG! OMG! If they would only open a restaurant up here in the San Francisco Bay Area! I would be blissfully broke but oh so satisfied! We were on a five-day eating vacation and this place was THE BOMB! We arrived at dinner time without reservations. The parking lot was full. There were people waiting inside and out. The restaurant was in chaos and everyone was smiling including the people waiting. They have a few large seafood tanks right inside the front door. They had spot prawns, geoduck clams, dungeness crab, another type of crab and large lobsters on display. As we looked around, every single table either had a lobster or the remnants of a lobster on it. Our party of five was seated in about 20 minutes. We were lucky enough to get an older, friendly, knowlegable waiter. We knew we wanted a lobster and asked for guidance in filling out the dinner. He suggested: (5) Clams with Basil, another house specialty - plump, tender, flavorful clams (5) Seafood w/ Bean Curd Soup - the broth looked clear and boring but it was clear and wonderful! We also wanted: (5) Beef Loc Lac - oh so tender and flavorful! (3) Vegetable Deluxe - may have been a (4) if everything else hadn't been so flavorful Oh, and you want to know about the lobster? Well, first of all, he suggested a medium. When I asked him why, he simply said because they were out of large. That medium lobster came in at 5.25 lbs! (10) Newport Special Lobster The numbers above are the scores that we gave each disn on a 1 - 5 scale and the score on the lobster was not a mistake. By far, THE best lobster that I have ever tasted. Outside the shells were tidbits of green onion, garlic and lobster roe that went so well on rice that you almost didn't need to eat the lobster. The only mistake we made was agreeing to let my brother order the Vegetable Deluxe. We could afford to go one meal without a vegetable dish and I would have loved to have ordered the Catfish with Garlic Sauce. Oh well, next time....

My god, this place is good. This place is lick your fingers, rant to your friends, then order another plate of food good. I honestly don't know where else I would go for Chinese seafood after this. And I'm Chinese. So a couple friends and I went here because one of them has been bugging me about going to a Chinese seafood restaurant for the past three weeks. So I dug deep into my Yelp bookmarks and found this treasure of a restaurant. We ate so much food and all of it was absolutely perfectly cooked and seasoned. First, we ordered some veggies to start off - the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce - which is hard to mess up so I'm not going to write much about that. But, I am going to rant and rave about the seafood. The Newport specialty crab came out first. I hate crab, only because it is such a pain to eat, but I didn't mind this one at all. Every bite was worth the effort - you pick through the shells to find a sliver of meat, shove it in your mouth and you're greeted with an explosion of pepper. I was satisfied with sucking on the shells and when I was lucky enough to get a piece of meat, I was in heaven. The fish with black bean sauce came out next. It didn't look all that great, it was just a full fish with some bean sauce on it. But, again, take a bite and you start thanking the seafood gods. The fish was super moist, flakey, perfect with that dollop of rice on your plate. Not to say non-Asians don't know food but when your white friend starts fighting for fish cheeks, you know there must be something to it. We had only ordered three dishes for the three of us but we polished off all this food in a matter of minutes after it was put on the table. So we decided to order another one and told them to give us some kind of squid dish that was spicy. What did they bring out? Battered fried squid and boy, was it amazing. It was light, not greasy, and you could really tell it was something special when our conversation went something like this: Friend: "blahblahblah...*puts squid in mouth* OMG! *chews*...blahblahblah" Other friend: "blahblahblah *eats squid* OH WOW *chews* blahblahblah" In total, the meal cost us $70 for all four dishes. Totally worth it.

#1 Let me say .. I ate 4 hours ago and I am still SOOO incredibly full I think I might DIE. I'm not exaggerating. Although there are more reviews here than any prospective patron of this restaurant could ever need read, I insist on writing something meaningless to contribute. Major Points: Lobstie, you must get the House Lobster. It come piping hot with ginger, scallion, mouth watering garlic and lots of ground pepper. I may have been the graduate's family dinner guest but I had no shame, I scraped every morsel and almost attempted eating the shell. Almost. The French styled fillet mignon steak cubes were decadent. Cook medium rare, super tender and came with lime to squeeze on top- interesting. I dig. The Kung Po Chicken was pretty bomb! I know how shameful to rave about this as a pure blood Chinese at an authentic Chinese restaurant to talk about the Kung Po Chicken. The sauce was special, can't put my finger on it. You won't regret trying it. The fresh steamed fish was HUGE and delicious. The quality of the fish and the seafood here is really top-notch. The Seafood pan fried noodles were only ok. I'd rate them 3 stars. Last words about #1; MUST get the Lobster. After that try the French steak cubes and any fresh fish #2 Shout out to USC grads!! Congrats!

WHAT TO ORDER AT NEWPORT SEAFOOD... No. 32 - CLAM WITH SPICY HOT SAUCE ... $10.95 They actually have clams in almost every shell, not like other restaurants where you have to search thru the shells to find the clam meat. Very juicy. No. 8 - CAT FISH WITH HOT & SOUR SOUP ... $10.95 This soup is steamy hot and taste sour more than spicy. It has a lot of vegetables and the cat fish is to die for. Highly recommended. No. 76 - FILLET FISH WITH BASIL ... $11.95 The fillet is lightly battered and the flavor is awesome. Not fried fish, but you just can't stop eating this dish with the basil flavor touch added. No. 79 - BEEF LOC LAC (FRENCH STYLE)...$11.95 This dish is also very delicious as the beef is very tender and the sauce is just right. I saw a lot of other tables ordering this dish as well. No. 14 - NEWPORT SPECIAL LOBSTER ... $SEASONAL PRICE The lobster was at $14.99 per lb last time and they run about 4-5 lbs per lobster...so it adds up to $60+ for this famous dish. 蔊ood if you have like 3-4 people to help eat it. The spices are all over the lobster and you will end up licking your fingers while eating this dish. No left overs for sure. Highly recommended. No. 114 - SAUTEED PEASPOUT ... $9.25 This dish was just okay. You can get it or not. No big deal. That's it for now folks. 蔍'll report back next time I try more dishes over there. �P.S. The decor was nice and neo-Vietnamese style if I would call it.

This restaurant is famous for its lobster and crabs. But i strongly recommend you order the steamed fish and sauteed chopped beef!! Oh...and the fried bean sprout could not be savorier (please pardon my poor English. i tried to express it's the best!!) �I do not feel this is a pricy restaurant at all. Compared with the quality of their food and service, it is actually in-expensive. And they offer lunch special during the weekdays, which is really nice and affordable. The menu is classic Chinese seafood restaurant. Out of their chef signatures, lobsters and crabs are all good. Their seafood is always well made. However, i feel the Giant Clam is a little bit costly ($80.00 last time i ordered) and my palate told me in a low voice: it's just an Okay.... I like the new decor and their re-model as well. i love Newport Tan Cang and it comes my top choice whenever i want to have a family dinner or celebrate any special event with friends who like seafood and Asian Cuisine. :)

Awesome! So we came here for a friend's bday dinner. 14 people, saturday night, no reservations. When I arrived we put our name down and the wait was over an hour... so we waited. And I'm soooo glad we did! When we were finally seated and decided on what we wanted to eat , the pre-fixe dinner for 10, plus an extra order of walnut prawns and beef cubes - I was absolutely starving and nervous that it wasn't going to be enough. I can't even remember all of the dishes we ate b/c there were so many but the ones to note that were absolutely amazing and that I would definitely be bringing my parents back for are: Lobster - cooked the asian way with onions, ginger, and plenty of black pepper. I don't usually like it done this way but there's something in this one that made it mouth wateringly delicious. I ate more than my fair share and we STILL had left-overs. Beef cubes - cooked to perfection, juicy and flavorful. Walnut prawns - always a hit, I know. So when all was said and done, dinner came out to less than $40 per person including tax and tip and alcohol and the massive amounts of: lobster, fish, crab, shrimp, beef, chicken, and sea cucumbers as well as covering the birthday boy's meal AND had 2 full bags of leftovers. I will absolutely be back.

Wanna get fat and slim down your wallet? Get some LOBSTER!!! They offer about 3-4 different kinds of lobster and the price, of course, is by season. The watermelon juice is also very delightful. This is a place to take the family after your graduation, wedding, or whatever the hell reason. I hate the fact that its crowded and you have to squeeze through chairs to get to your table. Oh and the Shrimp and Walnuts is a must. My friends and I fight over the last piece..or actually...we fight over EVERY piece. I saw my math teacher here once.....he was on a date...I never knew...he was gay. So i recommend this place. the food is great, the service too, and its worth your money.

On the day before Christmas, Newport Seafood gave to me, 12th table waiting, 11 bustling workers, 10 dollar salt and pepper squid, 9 bites of beef broccoli, 8 oz of rice, 7 steamed clams each, 6 bowls of Seafood soup, 5 POUNDS OF House Special lobster! ($15/lb) 4 pots of tea, 3 wet napkins, 2 sliced oranges, And a FULL, satisfied Yelper. Dare I say, my favorite seafood place EVER!!! Some advice, be wary of long waits on the weekends (to be expected with any great restaurant), but they also have a popular take-out option. And unless you generally prefer crab more, the lobster is completely worth the extra $$$. Merry Eatings and Happy Yelping!

Newport Seafood is a great place to go to when you're craving a different style of Chinese food. There is a Vietnamese Chinese influence on their dishes. I used to go to Newport when they were located down the street from my house in a small shopping complex, where parking was horrible as they shared the parking lot with Golden Deli. Newport and Golden Deli combined? NO PARKING! When Newport moved to their current location (the old Marie Calendar's), their dining space tripled. There are a lot of seats that can accommodate a lot more customers and parking is a lot easier as they're not sharing the lot with anyone. Parking does get crazy though when they're busy. There is parking in their lot and on the street. Do not park in the other lots not designated for Newport Seafood. They will tow your car (taken from the sign on the front door of Newport). Their lunch specials are cheap. They also have a set meal when you can pay a certain amount and get different dishes. They're known for their seafood, especially their lobster. Depending how brave you are and how much you want to spend, you can order a lobster. Prices will vary and the price is usually based on the seasonal prices. For the lunch special, we had the Kung Pao Shrimp (super good), Mongolian Beef, Ong Choy, Yang Chow Fried Rice and Clams w/Black Bean Sauce. Unlike most places, there were actually CLAMS inside the shell. We didn't get shafted. 蔜heir dishes do have a kick to them, but that's always expected when you eat Chinese food. Regular dishes are cheap and range from 10-13 bucks per dish. You can come here during lunch or dinner, where there are a lot of people all the time. The servers here are pretty quick and attentive. I haven't had bad service yet, which is amazing for a Chinese restaurant. You will go here for the seafood and it does get busy. You can place your order to go but to get rice to go, they charge you 25 cents per dish (if you want rice). They do accept credit cards too so don't worry about paying cash only. The old restaurant didn't accept credit cards but in this day and age, it's rare to see businesses that don't accept credit cards. They also serve beer here!

When I drove into the very crowded restaurant parking lot and saw the massive crowd of people waiting outside, I thought "this had better be worth parking across the street and walking in the cold." Well yes, yes it was. Not one dish was disappointing and my family ordered quite a lot of them. Obviously, their lobster is what Newport is known for. Their giant, succulent, full of flavor lobster was pure heaven. It felt sinful to eat as much lobster as I did in one sitting, but I couldn't help myself! Another awesome dish was the deep fried squid (almost the exact same as what most people would call Calamari), the batter..oh the batter even had a hint of flavor. We ordered vegetables, I vaguely remember eating some, but not caring what it was called. Although I can't quite describe every single dish to you, I promise that, if you love Chinese food (Panda Express or PF Chang's do NOT count), you will fall head over heels for the food at Newport. Weekend waits are extra long so be prepared!

Newport Tan Cang Seafood.... Om YOm Om Om yUmmmmmmm *burp* This place is the shizzle dizzle! And I'm saying this after eating the leftovers. I went here for dinner last night with my boyfriend since we were craving seafood, chinese style. 蔜his place is a vietnamese joint but the food is prepared the chinese way with some traditional vietnamese dishes. �First of- let me say- WOW! 蔜he seafood is fresh! The price is dirt cheap for the portions and the experience is wonderful. The decor is nice and the service is excellent. 蔒y taste palette was definitely satisfied and wanting more! Damn you stomach for not being able to expand more! What do I pay you for?!! What more can you ask for in a restaurant? �Clams in basil & garlic ($11.95)- 蔛o good! And they gave you so much! Seafood Pan Fried Noodles ($6.95)- The sauce was awesome. And the assortment of seafood was generous and tasty. Bo Luc Lac- ($11.95)- 蔛easoning was excellent! And the beef was so tender. I was seriously impressed with this dish. We were going to go for the lobster but it was $14.99 a lb with the smallest one they have being 4.5 lbs. Since it was just the two of us and we wanted to try other things, we opted not to try it.... THIS TIME AROUND. Our total dinner cost about $33 bucks! What a steal!

The one star off is when the restaurant is busy, the wait is long and waiters become impatient when you tried to take time to decide what to order. The food is great and flavorful in an expensive side if you order the must-order lobster.. Overall, my parents and I loved the food and will go back again in a quieter time.

First off... 蕋he food is good. 蔍 wouldn't go back here specifically for the food... 蔋owever, I would definitely come back for the ridiculous customer service. 蔄nd by ridiculous, I mean simply AMAZING!!! �As soon as we walked in, I noticed that they didn't have that annoying bullshit, "No, sir....Yes, sir....' crap attitude. 蔍t was very friendly, in a familiar way! 蔍t's almost the way an Aunt or Uncle would talk to you. 蔖olite but not too polite sprinkled with little jokes and compliments here and there.... 蔜hroughout the night we had a least 5 different people seeing if we needed extra napkins or if we had enough food to eat. 蔄t first, I just thought that everyone wanted to do me.... 蔈ither way, the experience was completely strange but quite enjoyable!

This place actually pretty affordable if you don't get their lobster special (I'm still waiting to get it). 蔣eah, super crowded during peak hours and parking is a bitch but it's worth it to have family style seafood at such a wonderful restaurant. I have to note that this place is very cleaned and well maintained. 蔜he decorations against the all on the shelf's are even wiped down. 蔍 love the wood floors as they add a little more class then the typical linoleum or tile floors at typical joints. The staff is incredibly friendly. 蔈veryone's very nice and happy to meet your needs. 蔉rom entering to leaving we were met with nothing but smiles. �Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant score: 93 Points

This is probably my favorite Asian seafood restaurant. �I do not live in the area, but a lot of my friends do and they recommended it to me. I would drive out from westLA to this restaurant to eat and I have recommended it to people who live in OC as well. I think it is a chain, but the one located in San Gabriel is the original one. It is definitely worth the hype and the wait (restaurant is super busy/crowded)! Their lobster is delish!!! & I really liked their pea sprouts as well :) Good for groups & the portions are pretty big~ Haven't tried their crab, but I bet it is just as good. Lobster dish really does not disappoint!!

I haven't been back to this restaurant since my friends 19th birthday I think. And I totally forgot how the food was. Maybe I was too young to appreciate good food. Anyhow, I've been waiting to come back to this place especially with all the good reviews and the new location a couple blocks from the old one. The new place is nice. Asian decor with booth type seating near the windows, and sectioned out seating for larger parties on the other side of the restaurant near the restaurant. The food.....was DELICIOUS!!! It was just me and my gf so we didnt order too much but this is what we had: House Special Crab (Very Fresh Crab. Cracked a bit for you for easier eating. The flavor was fantastic. We finished 2.5 lbs of crab which is the minimum order.) Clams (Very fresh clams. Sauce was good, light and fits well with the clam.) Crab and Fish Maw Soup (Perfect. Real crab and fish maw.) It was a great food experience. Thinking about taking my mom there for mothers day but afraid of the long line. :)

Although this place is typically considered a full blown Chinese style restaurant, I get the impression that there's a major Vietnamese influence involved somehow. Maybe it's the Vietnamese writing next to the English and Chinese writing on their menu? So the wait can be a pain. Put your name down and hang out for a bit. My friend got us number 00. They totally skipped us. It went from 99 then to 01 skipping 00. When we brought it to their attention, they swiftly scrambled to find us a table. It's all good, we were just happy to finally be seated. What to order, what to order? For a simple party of 5 and of course family style, we went with the combination that goes for $68. Easy to order, everyone was content with the items in that combo and it takes the pressure off of deciding what to get. On top of that, we tacked on an extra order of Beef Loc Lac - French style ($12). These little meat cubes accompanied by a pepper lime dipping sauce is the il-shiznit. It's legit son, so do yourself a favor and order it like you know what it's all about. Your date (if she enjoys red meat) will give you a golf clap in the end. The combination is a nice mix up of seafood, veggies, chicken, and even soup. Everything had a nice taste to it and was definitely not bland. Put the soy sauce away, you're embarassing the cigarette addicted cooks. I would recommend ordering a combo that suits your needs and of course based on the number of people you have in your party. It makes things easier but make sure everyone is content with the items included. The portions here are generous. We had to box a few items togo. The service wasn't horrible but okay. They got us everything we asked for. This place can certainly accomodate bigger parties and have some private dining areas as well. They don't really do reservations so just show up early and wait it out. Prices are reasonable, our total came out to about $90 something without tip. That's about $22-25 a head. Enjoy!

I say skip the house style lobster, which was good, however, it had too much spice (not in spicy) and oil. The sharkfin soup was to forget. 蔜here wasn't much if any shark fin at all. And it was expensive. The Shaken Beef is a must try though. 蔜he beef still oozed red juice when it came out. 蔍f you like your steak rare, this is what you should get. 蔍t was incredibly tasty and tender. 蔄wesome with rice.

This house is always crowded. 蔜heir speciality? 蔉resh lobster cooked with chili peppers and green onions. 蔞ery flavorful. 蔒y family always comes here for special occasions. 蔜he food is served family style. Another one of our usuals is black pepper beef, cut up into cubes and served with onions on the side. 蔜hey give you a white pepper dipping sauce for this as well. 蔜he interior decor is not much to look at and the crowd makes it noisy. 蔕h yeah, the majority of the customer base is Chinese, though the wait staff can speak decent ingoolish. My friend and I once came to this restaurant. 蔠e only ordered the lobster dish. 蔄fter a long silence and a moment of expectation, the waiter asked us, "is that it?" 蔍 guess people usually order 3 or 4 other dishes at this Chinese/Vietnamese establishment. 蔅ut us? 蔔o way. 蔒oney was tight. So we had our lobster with steamed rice. 蔜otal check? 蔄bout $50 ... which tells me, it's good to be a lobster.

THE BEST CRAB and LOBSTER!!! Sorry i don't mean to offend anyone but i'm not a big fan of american seafood preparations. 蔅lackened, grilled, broiled you name it .. it always ends up dry and bland . 蔜he usual steamed vegetables that it's served with just adds fuel to the fire... doesn't really cut it for me. �Instead however, i love my seafood tender, flaky and bursting with flavor. 蔄nd to get my fix of great seafood, i go to 蔔ewport Seafood. 蔜hey have multiple locations and 蕇erves a wide array of Vietnamese style Chinese cuisine... you can look thru the menu all you want but there is only one thing on the menu that is a must... HOUSE SPECIAL CRAB AND LOBSTER! Personally, I prefer/recommend the crab 蕇ince i 'm not a big fan of 蔿obster(unless... batali or morimoto prepares it!). �蔣our taste buds with burst from flavor overload...the house special preparation is savory, sweet, sour and a hint of spicy...all 蔵n a way thats euphoric ( strong word huh?)

I try to eat healthy most of the time, but there are times I crave something a little heavy and fried. 蔜his is where I like to come to get my fix. 蔍 was introduced to this restaurant by my parents and remember it when it was in its previous location on the corner of a strip mall, where there was always a wait outside, cramped quarters inside and a big plastic boba board. I hadn't been back since they moved down the street and across from a Mitsuwa market. 蔠hen you enter, you are greeted by a water tank filled with gigantic 10 lb crabs. 蔜here is now more room, with tables and also booths that line one side if the wall. The lobster in the house special sauce should not be missed. 蔜he lobster is very lightly breaded in a black pepper, garlic, ginger, soy, green onion, and jalape杘 marinade which is addicting. 蔜onight this was accompanied by the house special noodles, which are thin noodles that are pan fried so are crispy on top and lightly sauced on the bottom. 蔜o try to be good, we also had a side order of greens, but these are also cooked in oil so kind of defeats the purpose. �Feeling full and my cholesterol levels rising, this is not an every day meal, but something I like to have a few times a year. 蔜hey still offer boba on the menu as well!

Oh, Newport Seafood, how I love thee! My culinary love affair with this Chinese-Vietnamese family-owned restaurant began many years ago when they were located just a few blocks down the street from their current location on Las Tunas Avenue in the same plaza as Golden Deli, another great Vietnamese restaurant. 蔅ack then, loyal diners were crammed into a hole-in-the-wall space where decor and ambiance were nonexistent, but where the food and service were stellar. 蔜hey have maintained their high standards and continue to flourish in the new location, which was previously a Marie Calendar's restaurant. The interior is a blend of Asian decor with a modern twist. 蔄s you enter the foyer, red Chinese lanterns hang inverted from the ceiling, and a row of rustic wooden benches await diners queueing for a table. 蔄 glowing LA Times review is framed prominently on the wall while beautiful orchid arrangements add a splash of color to the space. 蔕ne perk of the larger location is semi-private dining cubicles with geometric room dividers to accommodate large parties and a more intimate dining experience than the main room. The key to any great seafood restaurant is having the freshest ingredients, and Newport is no exception. 蔔ear the entrance are a bevy of large tanks containing live Maine lobsters, dungeness crabs, large spot prawns, geoduck clams, and fish. 蔜hey even have one large tank devoted solely to live Alaskan king crabs, which are truly rare even among seafood restaurants. 蔜here's nothing like the taste of fresh seafood that has literally been scooped from the tanks, waiting to be transformed into delectable masterpieces. Some of my favorite dishes are: 1. 蔔ewport special lobster: 蔍f one dish could capture the essence of culinary nirvana, this may be it. 蔍t is certainly the one that's made them famous and ordered by most diners. 蔜o encourage sharing, the lobster is cut into smaller pieces, lightly battered and probably flash-fried, and then finished in a wok with tons of garlic, scallions, jalapenos, black pepper, fish sauce, and a hint of sweetness. 蔄ll these complementary flavors create a feeling of deep savory satisfaction - that fifth flavor known as umami. 蔕nce all the lobster has been devoured, you can scoop up the remaining sauce with small pieces of chewy roe onto your rice and simply enjoy. 蔠hen ordering any of the market-priced items, the waiter will generally ask for your size preference (small, medium, or large). 蔄 small lobster is usually 4-5 lbs with large ones in the 8-10 lb. range, so it's a great dish to share with others. 蔜hey usually charge about $16/lb. 2. 蔉rench style beef (bo luc lac): 蔜his dish is tender bite-sized cubes of filet mignon wok seared in a sweet and savory sauce and then served on a bed of lettuce, tomato slices, and caramelized white onions. 蔒y husband could devour this dish all by himself. 3. 蔛alt and pepper shrimp (tom rang muoi): 蔜hese deep-fried prawns are seasoned with salt & pepper and lightly dusted with a cornstarch batter. 蔜he shell and head give this dish great texture and crunch. 蔜hey garnish it with bits of jalapeno and scallions, and you can dip it in the salt, pepper, and lime sauce for extra flavor. 4. 蔒anila clams with fragrant Thai basil (ngheu xao la que): 蔜he succulent clams are juicy and perfectly sauteed in a white pepper sauce with garlic, jalapenos, and Thai basil. 蔜he sauce tastes divine just spooned over rice. �5. 蔇eep-fried tilapia (ca chien don): 蔜hey fry the fish until it's super crunchy and golden brown. 蔜he spicy fish sauce with garlic, lime juice, sriracha, and sugar complements it perfectly. 6. 蔛tir-fried ong choy with garlic (rau muong xao toi): 蔆ommonly found in Southeast Asian cuisine, ong choy (known as rau muong or Vietnamese water spinach) are long, hollow-stemmed greens with arrow-shaped leaves. 蔛auteed with garlic and fish sauce, they are a delicious and nutritious vegetarian dish. 7. 蔇eep-fried cubes of soft tofu dipped in soy sauce with jalapenos and scallions (dau hu chien don) During lunch hours, they offer a reduced-priced menu on popular items like the salt & pepper shrimp, clams with basil, and fried tilapia. 蔛eafood dishes such as the lobster and shaking beef are never discounted, though. Don't let the long lines or small parking lot deter you from the Newport Seafood experience. 蔜he consistently-excellent food, quick service, reasonable prices, and nice ambiance make this place one of my favorite restaurants.

THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT - anyone who doesn't like this place, obviously smokes crack and still lives with their mother. The prices are amazing, the service is top notch and the quality couldn't be better. I try to eat here at least once a week. I leave satisfied and never spend over $80 for a table of 5. MY SUGGESTION - try to go at lunch as the prices are drastically reduced and the portion sizes are HUGE. YOU MUST TRY: Peking Pork Chop, Thai Beef Stew, Chinese Broccoli (sauteed in Garlic NOT steamed in oyster sauce), Kung Pao Chicken, Salt N' Pepper Shrimp, Pepper Filet and of course the Lobster (the signature dish) MY ONLY COMPLAINT: there are 3-5 servers at this place that have at least one hairy facial mole. I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing that stops the Chinese from shaving or plucking these hairs. Sometimes it's a bit hard to look at when an older Chinese guy shows up to your table with a bushel of whiskers leaping out of a mole towards your food.

So my friend knows the owner's daughter who happens to also occasionally work there. And we read about all the great reviews on this site. One night we were fresh out of ideas on where to eat, so I told him, "Why not Newport Seafood?" So a group of us went, and every little tidbit that we read about the review was true. Including the guy who stands next to you pressuring you to order this and that. Long story short, we somehow got suckered into buying a $75 Lobster. It was DEEELICCIOUS. Until the bill came and our eyes bulged. A word of wisdom for some of you first timers, don't let the lost of translation between yourself and the waiter stop you from making sure you know the exact costs of everything with a "Seasonal" price tag on it. 蔛ure the food is great! But I ain't coming back here unless my parents or some rich people treat me out.

I've been going to this restaurant for over 10 years now and I am still not sick of it. The lunch specials are super cheap, super delicious. It's one of the very best restaurants in the competitive neighborhood of San Gabriel Valley for food. Dishes that I love and can't find anywhere else that cook them better: 1. Salt and Pepper Shrimp. Oh they're like chips! They are so perfectly fried and salted that you can eat the shell with it. I can't get enough of these, especially when you dip them in lemon juice with salt and pepper. 2. Kung Pao Chicken. I really can't find a restaurant that makes it better then Newport. It's just the right amount of caramelized sweetness, balanced with crunchy peanuts. 3. Their NEWPORT SPECIAL LOBSTER! Mmmmm, divine! We always come to this place for family dinners and celebrations and we always order their lobster specials. It may be a bit pricey, but so worth the price, and they don't rip you off by inflating the weight of the lobsters. The lobster is always fresh and the sauce...amazing. Also can't find a restaurant that can beat their style of cooking seafood. 4. Clam with Spicy Hot Sauce. I don't usually like clams because I don't like how I sometimes can taste the gut, but Newport makes it really well and adds a lot of good ingredients that I have become a fan. And of course, the waiters are very friendly and make you feel right at home. Definitely a place to visit and return!

I've been eating at Newport Tan Cang for years. 蔍 feel like our family discovered it before they became big, when they were still in an assuming strip mall further down on Las Tunas. 蔐uckily, when they moved to their current location, the food hasn't changed. 5 stars for the food. 蔋ouse special lobster is a must for any special occasion (and at $16 per pound, it's definitely a special occasion treat). 蔒y other favorites include the kung pao chicken, bo luc lac (Vietnamese/French beef), fish filet with basil sauce, and walnut shrimp. 4 stars for the service and prices. 蔜heir lunch specials used to be a lot cheaper and with bigger portions. 蔛ometimes the service is rushed and abrupt, as it is in most Chinese restaurants. 蔜hey are always so busy and are trying to get you in and out so they can seat more customers.

Funny thing about B rating is that I actually think it's a positive sign about the food being good at an asian place. The lobster was excellent, especially with the newport special preparation (with jalapeno).

This place has all the traits of being a traditional Asian restaurant. The traits of being noisy, great food and bad service. This place is one of the noisiest restaurants I've ever been to and their service is not any better. Once, the waiter sat us down and he already tried to take our order but he didn't even show us the menu yet. Also, while we were still in the middle of eating, he already gave us our bill. However, the food makes up for it! Their lobster is absolutely delicious!! It's really hard to describe the quality of their lobster, it's just so good!!! Their french beef is also good! We get those two entr巈s every single time we go there. �CONS: Long wait and bad service.

HANDS DOWN best Chinese food restaurant that I've ever been to!! I mean I went about a month ago so I don't remember all of the dishes that were ordered, but everything that I ate was delicious and tasty! �My most memorable dishes were the house special lobster, the shrimp and walnut, the clams, satay beef cubes and the crab! I think if you go there you should definitely try the lobster! I mean it's super flavorful and you can tell that the lobster is very fresh. I think there is a certain minimum that you must buy to get the lobster though... like at least 5 pounds or something. It's definitely not cheap, but worth it to try! The service was great and they actually came and checked on us a few times to make sure we were ok and if we needed anything. That's usually something that Chinese restaurants lack so I did appreciate it. Overall, I think that if you are planning to go out for Chinese food 蔵n a large group this is the place to be.

Great place! I want to bring my family here for lunch. We had the delicious lobsters here, along with bo luc lac, and a whole bunch of lunch special (garlic vegs, chili tofu, 2 sorts of soup, peppered shrimps, etc) We had a big party, of 8 i believe? $20 per person was enough for lunch. Keep this in mind, this a vietnamese restaurant in disguise. My taiwanese friend brought us here leading us to believe that this was chinese food. Good try there!

Excellent Southeast Asian family-style seafood if you have the stomach for it. The property used to be an old Coco's or a Marie Calendars - can't you tell? Lobster is delivered chopped up, stir-fried and still attached onto the shell; be sure to ask the waiter the many styles in which the kitchen can prepare this for you. 蔉ish are prepared steamed or fried, and I believe it is possible to ask the kitchen to first de-bone (and de-head and de-fin) it before presentation. The fillet mignon cubes are easy to eat and fun for everyone. Also remember to ask about their boba drink menu. The boss lady (and her daughter) who runs and owns the Newport chain considers this branch as her headquarters.

Like they say, dingy interior, 20% really good food / 80% really bad food, expensive, crowded, and long wait. The lobster was huuuge. The smallest one was four lbs, the waiter said. I think it had five claws. j/k. I think people who like their food with a whole lotta spice and seasoning will love this restaurant. It wasn't right for me, who like my lobster, fish, or crab steamed with ginger and scallions, so the tenderness of the meat shines through. The French style Beef Cubes were great. So were the Sauteed Frog Legs. The Fried Sole and Stir Fried Shrimp (both "lunch specials") were bad. So lessons learned - order from dinner menu even in the middle of day. P.S. - The free oranges for dessert were awesomely delicious. Wonder where they got them from. �)

Our friend Eric recently converted to a pescatarian so we decided to come here and have dinner. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and is conveniently close to us which compelled me to give this place 4 stars. Fair warning though, the restaurant specializes in SEAFOOD so if you're looking to eat anything but that, you're better off going somewhere cheaper like sam woo. Tonight we ordered: -steamed rock cod--fresh and sauce was flavorful::yummy:: -Chinese greens--very good and healthy! -pork chop w/ spicy salt--we've had better elsewhere but still ok -catfish sour soup--flavorful, a bit on the sweet side -Kung pao beef--dish of the night! Lots of flavor and perfect texture. The service was pretty good compared to most typical Asian restaurants in this area-very patient while we were ordering and catered to our needs throughout the meal. I like when you don't have to wave them down to come over for assistance :p Overall it's a great restaurant for seafood cravings, but a bit on the steep side if you order non-seafood dishes. Total of the evening: $95.00 (including tax)

Is very very very good. The best idea is to go there during off peak hours also, go with a group of five or more. Weekends, holidays (even weekday evenings) are a mess. 蔍 went Friday for lunch and took a nice two hour nap after my 2lb crustacian experience. Also, not to sound like Johnny Drama but you better hydrate before you go cuz its pretty flavorful /spicy / salty (but no MSG). 蔣our headache isn't from MSG, but its from dehydration

I'm generally not much of a seafood fan, but just came here for a birthday celebration. Let's start off with... * PRICE: It's a high quality seafood restaurant. 蔣elp says $$, but you can expect to pay $$$ if you get all the good shellfish. * QUALITY: Their seasoned lobster was AWESOME. 蔕nce again, I only eat lobster on occasion (it's price-prohibiting), but the way the lobster is prepared here is just as good as it gets. 蔜here is plenty of seasoning (but not too salty) and the ingredients just exude freshness. 蔍'd have to order that lobster dish everytime. Their salty calamari was pretty good as well. 蔍 like calamari, and their version had just the right amount of salt. If you like curry, then their curry crab won't disappoint. 蔍 find crab a bit troublesome to eat, and they didn't really provide any cracking devices on the table. Fish... their fried fish was a tad mushy for my taste, but otherwise flavorful. Bottom line on quality... every food dish tastes fresh and is served nice and hot. 蔖ortions are generous, and there wasn't really any dish that stood out... they were all GOOD! * PARKING: Parking was a huge problem. 蔜hey have a small lot for the amount of people that are eating/waiting. 蔐ong story short, if it's a weekend, park at the 211 city building next to it (it's closed anyway). 蔕therwise, street park. 蔛ave yourself the time (and gas) going inside looking for a spot. * WAIT: I believe we had a reservation. 蔍 arrived fashionably late, so I dun really know. 蔜here must've been 70 people waiting outside! 蔛aturday dinner here is madness. * OVERALL: Enjoyed the experience. 蔋igh quality, flavorful food. 蔄 bit pricey, so it won't become a frequent eat. 蔄mbiance is a bit cramped and loud. 蔜hey do fit a lot of people inside...

The second line of the Wikipedia article for "Lobster" describes the economic importance of this marine crustacean as seafood, comprising of a billion dollar global industry. To get your claws on some of these delicious critters whose second definition is food, Newport Seafood is a popular choice for a Chinese-style seafood meal . I was so ready for a mouthful of juicy, salty, delicious lobster after fighting the awful parking lot traffic of the brightly lit Newport Seafood Restaurant. Along with a group of friends we ordered fish, clams, and a few other dishes to go along with our lobster seafood dinner. The restaurant is clean and great for groups but frigid. Service was fast considering the large crowd. Typical of Chinese restaurant food, I was left reaching for half a dozen glasses of water later that evening but it was great for a once-in-a-while treat.

Thank you for redeeming my very bad experience at Crustaceans. �The seafood here is so good and I was loving the prices. 蔜rue, the lobsters here are gigantic. Everything was seriously good and we had a large party of 14 people who feasted on: House special Lobster, Crab, Shrimp, Clams, House special beef, pea sprouts, deep fried tofu, there was more but i forget after having gone into a seafood coma. Yum! I can't believe it still came out to less than $40 a person with tip. And we had tons of leftovers. 蔠e were here for a special birthday and they treated us very well. My friends are local and come here a lot so that may have had a lot to do with it too. They say come early because there can be a long wait if you arrive after 7pm.

Dear Newport Tan Cang Lobster, You are one of the freshest, tastiest, lobster I've probably ever had. 蔠hen you arrived shortly onto the dining table, I could smell the garlicky steam come off your red shell. 蔣ou looked so succulent and made my mouth water when I saw you drenched in oil, green onions, spices, peppers, and garlic. 蔠hen I took my first bite into you, your meat was so succulent. (That's what she said.) Your spices complemented real well with the crab fried rice ($8) and yam vegetable ($12). 蔅oth dishes were great but the vegetable was a bit more pricey than expected. You almost got me in trouble when I licked my fingers because it tasted so damn good...my man-friend even questioned if i liked the lobster more than him. 蔕ops. I was enjoying myself too much that I didn't even realize when my water was refilled and didn't say thank you. Double oopsies. They claimed you would be a size "small" being a little over 4 pounds but we scarfed all 5.75 pounds of 蕐ou real fast. 蔋owever, why you gotta be so extravagant and expensive at $15 per pound? �I would've given you five stars purely for your yumminess. Minus one star because your meatiness cost us a whopping $90. I might have to rethink just how much I like you. I will be back when I want to splurge again. Until then, I will be daydreaming your juicy, flavorful meat until we meet again. Sincerely, Lobster monster *nom nom nom*

Excellent lobster. They also have crab as well. The house lobster has the right amount of sauce. The crab was salt and peppery with a light crust. Prices in July were about $16/lb for lobster and $13 or $14/crab. The total for a med lobster and small crab was about $85 together to give you an idea (but that can feed 5 people easily). We also ordered French/Vietnamese style beef $11 and on-choy $12 (I don't get why it was more expensive than the beef?). For about $28 a person, we all walked away full and happy. =) The restaurant itself is very clean which is nice.

You know it, It's Lobster time! Tan Cang is strictly famous for its cheap lobster. I know there are many branches for this restaurant and this one is my first time here, actually my first time having its lobster..How weird is that? I've been to its restaurants numerous times, but its Lobster never came into thought. I guess it's only special occasions when I do eat Lobster or either that I'm just lazy eating it and I hate being messy when eating. 蔍 was here for an early celebration for my sister's bday party with the family. Well of course, she gets to order everything and I just rolled with it. We had the lobster, salt and pepper pork chop, Kung Pao chicken, Kung Pao Beef, Complimentary Sweet and Sour soup, fish fillets with steamed vegetables, Spinach, Brocolli, Fried seafood Noodle, and Grilled Beef over Onion. All that for only 22 bucks per peep and there were 7 of us. Let's just say I'm so FULLY satisfied and only wished I could have taken a nap right after that...in other words, it was a great meal at a very affordable price for a family feast. Need I say more.. My highlight for that day was that one of the waitor probably in his late 40's sporting a full on MoHawk.. That totally left me speechless, but impressive. I dont know about ya'll, I dont' get to see that kind alot.

Went for a dinner with nine people - 6 adults and 3 toddlers. We were seated at a round table, and I was immediately struck by how comfortable and family-friendly this restaurant is. The waiters were super nice, and when they saw one of the kids fussing with the food, he offered to cook up a cheeseburger for him. We passed, but it was nice knowing they would cater to a kid off the menu like that. We ordered one of the set family meals for $68. There are cheaper and more expensive family meal options, depending on how many are in your party and how hungry you are. In addition to the set, we also ordered the house special noodle. The 6 adults were able to polish everything off. It felt like we really got our money's worth. This is what was included in the family meal: - house seafood soup: pretty good. We could've gotten a hot and sour catfish soup as well, but we were happy with our choice. - clam with spicy hot sauce: the clams were steamed/cooked perfectly, but none of us were all that crazy about the sauce they came in. I'd give this dish a MEH. - baked crab with salt and pepper: definitely the highlight of the meal. If I weren't among company, I would've sucked on the delicious fried seasoning down to the last piece. This dish is kind of hard to eat while maintaining good table manners, but damn, it tasted good. - kung pao chicken (or beef): this was one of the best kung pao chicken dish I've ever had. Good quality meat (no googly pieces) and perfectly flavored. - sauteed peasprouts: alternatively we could've asked for the Chinese broccoli which I wished we had. I dunno - the peasprouts were kind of hard to chew and swallow, and I wasn't too crazy about the seasoning. - steamed whole fish: yum. I've had better but still, yum. - house special noodle: we ordered this in addition to the set described above. It was chock full of seafood, which was great, but I would've preferred more noodle. The flavor was excellent. I can't wait to come back and try more of the dishes.

No doubt the best Chinese restaurante in the San Gabriel Valley. Just about everything on the menu is top notch. 蔜heir house special lobster while exspensive is to die for. Since they only serve lobsters that are 2-4 pounds its best to come with a big group and enjoy. Other great dishes are the Kung Pao chicken, crispy calamari with spicy salt, and fresh crab with ginger and scallions. �Since the place is always packed, I recommend going at lunch when they serve the same dishes at lunch time prices and the lines are shorter.

I came here recently for a work luncheon for a Chinese New Year event. First off, you can't reserve tables because this business is booming and they simply wouldn't gain any sort of advantage by adding this sort of service. Anyway, the place was so packed and loud! Very lively atmosphere and full of Chinese people so you know this place is good. They are known for the lobster and it is definitely worth trying. They are generous with the green onions thus the flavors really sink into the meat of the lobster. All the stir frys are tasty... typical greasy Chinese food. The deep fried shrimps are sosososooso yummy! You can eat the whole shrimp including the head so it was like eating gourmet chips. With 70 people at this event, each person paid $20 (including tip). We had 10 tables and each table had about 9 or 10 dishes. Not bad.

I just came back from a thoroughly satisfying meal with my family. We have been coming here for at least 8 or 9 years. Every time I come back to visit my family, we always have a meal here. Tonight, for around $200, we got a whole lobster, 2 vegetable dishes, a whole deep fried fish, clams, shrimp with tofu, soup, and my dad's German beer (yes, an odd choice at a Chinese restaurant). For desert, they served up a couple plates of sliced oranges. If you really want bang for your buck, definitely go during lunchtime. They have a special lunch menu with dishes starting around $4.25(?). Lunch usually begins with complementary sour and spicy soup. We always get the clams sauteed in basil and jalapeno, deep fried prawns, and Vietnamese shaking beef. �I would advise coming early as they don't take reservations and the wait may last an hour. The service is pretty decent for the amount of money you're paying. The wait staff have always been friendly and happy to serve. My only regret is that we don't have one of these in San Francisco. For those of you living in the SGV, you guys are damn lucky.

Updated Review: A friend was recently in town for a wedding. 蔛he and her boyfriend had walked by Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant the day before and thought it looked like a cool place. 蔜he next night they called up all their SoCal friends for dinner to try this place out. 蔒y husband and I reluctantly agreed since we were not impressed with the place the first time. 蔅ut, I kinda wanted to check the place out again since it had moved up the street to the bigger place. Parking was still bad. 蔛ince they moved they were now even closer to our house. 蔛hould've walked. 蔄nd even though the new place was at least 4 to 5 times larger than the old place, there was still a decent wait. 蔋ubby was already not impressed. 蔍t did give us time to catch up with our friends outside. 蔋owever, because we were chatting it up outside, we failed to hear our number being called, and the hostess didn't bother to come out to look for us. 蔋ad we not gone in to check on our status, we probably would've been waiting indefinitely. I have to say, I was already impressed with the decor. 蔋UGE improvement from the old place. 蔠hen we were seated, a couple of the waiters greeted a guy in our party as if they knew him. 蔄pparently this guy and his girlfriend are regulars who trek down from Glendale at least once or twice a month when they crave good seafood. 蔔eedless to say, we left it up to him to order for our party of 7. Since this guy did the ordering for us, I don't know the exact name of the dishes he ordered. 蔄ll I know is that there was: 1) Some sort of Seafood Soup (maybe cat fish with hot and sour soup?) 2) Mayonnaise Shrimps with Walnut 3) House Lobster 4) Pea Sprouts 5) Friend Frog Legs 6) French Beef Cubes 7) Salt & pepper shrimp 8) Steamed rice 9) Hot Tea 10) About 6 or 7 bottles of French Beer 11) Oranges for dessert ����������������__________________________________________________?__ Roughly about $250 to $260 before tip We left a good size tip. 蔜he seven of us threw in $45 each= $315 total. Seafood Soup (cat fish with hot and sour soup?): I don't like hout and sour soup, so I thought it was OK. 蔈veryone else really liked it. Mayonnaise Shrimps with Walnut: OK. 蔍've had better. House Lobster: Again, we were in awe of the size. 蔠hen we asked the waiter how large it was, he checked our receipt. 蔍t was barely over 6 lbs. (medium size). We would've guessed about 10 lbs or so. 蔍t was more than enough for our party of 7. 蔍t was MUCH better than the first lobster we had. 蔕ur group consensus was that the best parts of the lobster were the claws and the lobster eggs/sauce. Pea Sprouts: Yummy Friend Frog Legs: Did not try, but everyone else enjoyed them. French Beef Cubes: Tender Salt & pepper shrimp: Decent About 5 to 7 bottles of French Beer: I didn't try it, but everyone said it went perfectly with the meal. All in all, my husband and I were much more pleased with our 2nd visit to Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant. 蔕ur party of 7 included 4 fairly good sized guys who could eat quite a bit. 蔠e devoured all the dishes, yet were all left feeling full and satisfied. 蔠hen we were not busy commenting on how good the food was, there was silence as we savored the dishes. 蔈ven my husband was saying good things about the place when we left, AND he didn't complain about how nasty the bathrooms were, so I guess that problem's been resolved. So the restaurant earns another star because: The food was better, the bathrooms are cleaner, the ambience has improved, and even though we paid in cash the restaurant now accepts credit cards. 蔍 still can't give it 5 stars because I didn't think that all the dishes were exceptional. After our first visit my husband said he'd never eat at this restaurant ever again. 蔄fter this visit, we'd likely go back again.

I've been wanting to try this new location and finally did. 蔍 went with a couple of friends to their old location years ago. 蔜oday, we arrived before noon and waited about 40 minutes. 蔜his location was very nice and modern looking inside. 蔈ven their bathroom was nice and pretty clean which is unusual for Chinese restaurants! Although I wanted to get a lobster, the waiter said they only had 5 pound ones and I wanted a smaller size at $16 a pound. 蔍 wasn't quite willing to shell out $80+ for such a big sized one today. �We ended up getting the popular French style beef along with several lunch specials--chicken with Chinese broccoli, pan fried pork chops, fish filet with basil, deep fried whole fish, and shrimp with garlic sauce. Most of those dishes were very good. 蔜he French style beef was, indeed, very tasty, tender, and flavorful. 蔜he lunch specials come with hot and sour soup, but it wasn't very good. 蔜hey need to find a new recipe. They have a parking lot, but it was very crowded so we just parked on the street. 蔍 would come back in the future although I'm not out in that area too much. 蔜hat is a very long trek especially with horrible weekend traffic on the 10 Freeway!

The two best dishes: -House Special Lobster (I always love it when I get the female lobster because the roe (eggs) are super yummy!) -Salt 'n' Pepper Pork Chops (hardly MSG and melts in your mouth goodness) The atmosphere is nice and pretty clean. Ambience is casual, and kinda intimate and romantic, especially if you get seated in the booths or in the private back rooms (if you're eating with a party of 10+). The waiters are pretty good with their services. They make sure to accommodate you as best as they can, especially in making sure if you want water or their boba drinks instead of tea, needing additional eating utensils or napkins, or making sure the entrees are mild if you can't handle spicy food (like me). �I prefer coming there for lunch because: the portions in the menu are about the same size as dinner (small - medium), and the prices are cheaper at lunchtime. If you're on a budget like most people, and I see the elderly Asians do this, you can buy a lot during lunchtime, and take home the rest for dinner at night. Though, if you prefer to eat dinner there, it can get pretty pricy, especially if you're eating with a party of 6+ people. Also, the place can get pretty pack, and the parking lot they have is pretty small, though there's street parking. Beyond that, it's a pretty good place to eat...though it would be nice if around lunchtime, they serve some other soup appetizer other than: spicy sweet and sour.

Came here for my Mom's birthday last week and I am thoroughly impress with this place. From the ambiance, to the service ( unheard of in Chinese restaurants ), and especially to the food. We ordered the set menu, and everything and I mean everything was very good. Not loaded w/ MSG either, just skilled cooking at it's finest. I do want to mention that this place attracts a lot of people. Prepare for the wait. But the staff is just absolutely friendly and helpful! Enjoy.

We came here for a family Christmas dinner for about eight of us and had to wait for about an hour and a half- but it was worth the wait. 蔜he restaurant unfortunately doesn't take reservations! Based on the number of people waiting and the temptation to cram as many people in as possible, I was expecting the ambience of the restaurant to be really noisy and boisterous and crowded, but when you're sitting down, it's A-OK. 蔣ou're pretty far apart from your nearest neighbour, and the staff are quite attentive. �In terms of the food, all the seafood dishes were DELICIOUS - lobster, crab, deep fried shrimps with candied pecans. 蔜he greens were also really very tender, with big yummy chunks of fried garlic. 蔋ighly recommended! 蔒y sister remarked, however, that some dishes were a bit too "sauce-y" - perhaps that is the Vietnamese spin on Cantonese cuisine? �On the not highly recommended list, don't order the duck or sea cucumber with mushrooms - these were rather disappointing. �I would give this place 4.5 stars, if it were not for the long wait.

If you want authentic Chinese cooking, you usually sacrifice service unless you're willing to pay for overpriced dishes at some fancy schmancy restaurant. Good food is not hard to find in the Monterey Park/Alhambra area but good service is. I swear it is not part of the Asian restauranteurs' DNA. They just drop the food off and never to be seen again until it's time to drop off the check, usually in the middle of your meal. I would have to agree with other Yelpers that Newport delivers both - good food and good service. Hell, I'll even throw in good atmosphere. Good food - I stopped by for lunch this weekend and ordered off the lunch menu. There is a good selection of dishes ranging from $7-8. That's not too bad since each dish includes soup and rice. Had the kung pao chicken, deep fried fish, and clams with black bean sauce. Everything was delicious. The kung pao chicken stood out since the chicken pieces were glazed which gave it flavor, instead of the usual sauce dumped over tasteless chicken bits. Mental note: I looked around and almost every table got a lobster. I must try one next time. Good service - Staff was nice to the Chinese speaking and non-Chinese speaking customers. You're not assigned to a specific server so different staff stopped by to check if you got your soup already, swap out plates, and even asked if everything was ok. Good atmosphere - They took an old Marie Calendar building and renovated the entire interior. The decor is eclectic - pink lamp shade over a chandlier at some booths, partition between booths for some privacy, roomy booths, huge pretty tank at the front holding the biggest crustaceans I have ever seen (those guys were at least 10 lbs each), interesting wall treatment in the lobby. I could go on and on about the cutesy decor but the most important thing is that the place is super clean. That includes the restrooms.

I love u, dear friend but u've lost some crisp. SOLID 4.5. the old location's food was consistently a 5. although the new location has a much better decor and space, the food has dropped to a 4.5 (which is still pretty DAMN good). here's the lowdown: I love this place. near and dear to my heart there is no place like newport. I've been to all 3 locations here, rowland, and santa ana. all consistently good. when lobster season rolls around, I get excited just thinking about that house sauce with the lobster. been at the old sgv location atleast 5-6 times. stirfried jalapenos with that salty savory but sweet, mixed in with lobster eggs, I could eat JUST THAT over my rice any day, everyday. although Im not complaining about the succulent, sweet lobster that its slathered all over. mmMMmmm.... kung pao chicken- yeah yeah I know its kung pao chicken. at a restaurant I would never usually order it 蔮ut when it came part of the family dinner set, I wasn't complaining, especially when I discovered its the BEST DAMN kung pao Ive had. its like none other bc the texture is almost slightly CRISPY with the perfect sweetness and not oversauced by any means. so good, so good. catfish soup- yeah some ppl might not like this bc its really sweet with odd ingredients like tomatoes and pineapple but when its piping hot, the catfish melts in ur mouth. if u wait til it gets lukewarm, both the fish and broth are just meh, so eat it while its hot. clams with basil- I dont even like basil and this dish is DANG good. the clams are pretty ginorm for this kind of dish. very succulent and fresh. gotta love it saucy. I sure do. so those are the usual suspects. new location like everyone's mentioned is bigger and brighter. its actually quite nice. no more waiting hours for a crammed table in the closet space they had before. still packed though. I actually love the "private" rooms in the back where u can still see through and check out what everyone's eating on ur way to the bathroom. haha. the update: ok so why the half star deduction? I think it may have something to do with the heat temp with the woks back there but the CRISP just ain't there NO MO :( 蕋he house sauce that I loved wasnt' as "stir fried" and was a bit more bland (still good though). this was further evidenced by the kung pao that no longer has its crispy outside. so sad, so sad. but Iucky for me, I have a rebound rate of 5 seconds (or more like 5 minutes which is when the steamed fish came....) this time we also ordered the steamed fish and 蔵t was pretty DAMN good as it was extremely fresh, moist, delicate in ur mouth. v nice. Im not over the lost of crisp but gotta move on, right? in past visits I've also had the deep fried tofu which was most excellent and the french style beef (which everyone raves about but I think is just a-ok). I still love u, newport, but KICK UP THE HEAT a little (literally)

HO CHIAK! 蔠hich means, delicious, in a non-descript chinese dialect. �Hit me up if you knew what it meant without the translation. We ordered the tom yu chai, the House Special Chow Mein, the House Special fish -- half fried, half steamed, the beef with kailan, and the mapo tauhu. 蔍 would've skipped the noodles, but everything else was super yum-o. 蔍 think the check came out to a measly $100 for a group of 7. 蔄nd mind you, the fish we had was SUPER gimoungous and SUPER fresh. 蔜he food here reminds me of the chinese joints in SE Asia -- a good, great thing. The folks here are teo chew from vietnam, I think, so it helps if you speak the language. 蔛ervice is friendly and fast. 蔉riendly, is NOT something you expect at a chinese joint. 蔛o a plus for that. Would've given it 5 stars if the damned place wasn't an hour and half drive from the Westside. Get there before 6:30 -- the place is uber popular.

In short, food was edible and better than I can cook it of course. But I would not come here again if I was choosing a restaurant. We may have ordered some of the less popular dishes or something, but it just wasn't good enough to justify the long 1 hour wait we had to endure, the wait itself knock a star off this rating. People must think it's good since it's often crowded. give it a try. just because it's not for me doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a try. This place is not authentic Chinese cuisine despite the "Chinese Restaurant" in their name. It is Vietnamese owned and operated so keep that in mind so you don't get surprised by the difference in flavor, This place is Vietnamese with a Chinese influence at best....maybe the other way around. There was nothing Kung Pao about the chicken, the beef was cooked with MSG soy sauce (AKA Maggi) and was way over salty because of it. Their vegetable dishes were so oily I had to throw my bowl of rice away after the oil rolled off the veggies. The Lobster was EXTREMELY overpriced. Seriously, if you think usual Chinese restaurants charge what this place do for lobster and crab, you might as well go to Red Lobster. No it's not expensive, but just not fairly priced...wish they did price matching like department stores =) Chinese people don't use fish sauce in their cuisine. We order a garlic fish dish that had NO garlic, and it was cooked in fish sauce....WHY? it's already fish. it was nasty and I'm pretty sure they gave us the wrong thing. When we asked the waiter what the dish was (while pointing at it) he said something weird. Then when we gave him a confused look, he asked what we ordered, we told him "Garlic Fish" He said "Yes that is garlic fish" WTF?!?! The Kung Pao Chicken came out literatlly 10 seconds after the waiter took our order. The outer circle of chicken on the plate was completely dried which tells me it had been sitting under a heat lamp, I'm going to guess it was someone's else order that was brought back and they were just waiting for someone to order it so they didn't waste it. Whatever they did, it was not cooked to order and flavor wise, it was not Kung Pao chicken. For what they charge per dish, they were very small. Chinese seafood restaurants are plentiful in San Gabriel Valley. This place is a rip off by comparison. I do have to say they keep the place fairly clean and service is quick. If this was lunch time and not too crowded I would consider checking out the other dishes. But not a place I'm willing to wait an hour for! Oh, two members of my family took one look at the crowd eating while we waited and said there were too many young people eating here, this place can't be that good because young people don't have the taste buds for authentic Chinese food. I agree, just look at the stupid crowd waiting at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia. Place is so overpriced and unauthentic, it's retarded. The original true Din Tai Fung needs to put their foot down and regulate!

This is probably the best Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to. The house special lobster is the bomb. Straight up. Sure it costed $99, but there were 6 of us and it was well worth it. The meat was juicy and the sauce was so tasty. We didn't even expend too much energy getting the meat out as the lobster was chopped up nicely. So normally with a place that excels so well in one dish, other dishes seem to stumble. Not this place. Everything else was delicious from the bo lok lak (tender cubed beef over a bed of lettuce and tomatoes) to the crab fried rice to the crispy noodles. Yum! I can't wait to go back. Even the Vietnamese catfish sour soup was good. We did notice a half steamed/ half fried fish that we will definitely try out the next time. Price for everything aside from the lobster was VERY reasonable. Service was even good. They claimed about an hour wait, but we were able to get seated within 40 minutes. The staff was super friendly and even willing to take orders before we sat down. If you're in the LA area and looking for some good Chinese food, look no further than Newport Tan Cang!

WOW. amazinggg... The bf's brother decided to buy us both dinner here beacuse of our birthdays...this was my first time being here and first time trying lobster the way you chinese/vietnamese people do it. And first time seeing lobsters and crabs and prawns that big!! wow so cool! damn i sound like some newbie who lived under a rock.... LOL Anyways! Tastes So good! Service is very attentive for an asian resturant. The servers can speak different languages. There was 2 viet, 1 taiwanese, and me 蔾orean in our group and based on our looks, the server spoke to each one of us in viet, chinese, and english ahha i thought that was cool... They change your bowls/ plate ever so often even though i don't think its necessary but thats a nice touch. There was 4 of us in our party, we ordered the lobster, bo luc lac, clam in black bean sauce, bok choy, and fried tofu and overall total was around almost $200? jeez! 蔍t is pricey 蔮ut worth a splurge every once in awhile. I can't wait to bring my family here.

went here for my cousin's 60th bday a few weeks ago. 蔰ude's old enough to be my dad, but i digress. 蕋his place is always packed whenever we're cruising down las tunas. 蕁ow, i know why. the (special?) lobster in a slightly spicy sauce was my favorite. 蔵 was seated with the relatives who didn't like lobster that much. 蕋hat meant more for me. 蕎oohoo! i also recommend the mongolian beef. 蕋he meat was so tender and tasty. 蔵 could've sworn it was filet mignon but never bothered to ask. the peking style pork chop was pretty good too. 蕇oft pieces of pork lathered in a sorta sweet-sour bbq sauce. 蔲inger-lickin good! the assorted seafood soup and kung pao chicken though weren't all that memorable, while the baked crab was downright dry. 蕎on't partake in these items again, but there's plenty of other stuff i wanna try next time. the service was decent. 蕋hey handled our three-table party well, in addition to a full house. 蕂ne of our waiters also spoke a bit of tagalog, so he was a hit with my older family members. �definitely get here early to avoid a wait. 蕎e had dinner around 6 and didn't have a problem getting seated. 蕋he crowd showed up shortly thereafter....

This is a great Chinese restaurant. The service was superb; the waiters, busboys, entire staff were extremely friendly and polite -- and they all spoke English!! 蔔ow that's just not something you see at a Chinese restaurant. The seating area itself was nicely spaced, didn't feel crowded at all. And the food was extremely tasty. I typically have a difficult time rating Chinese restaurants because the food all seems to taste the same to me. 蔅ut here, they truly have some original and unique seafood dishes. 蔍've never been a big fan of clams, but the ones I had here in the black bean sauce has changed my mind. Again, a really great Chinese restaurant, one of the best I've been to in a long time.

I'm always curious about the hype that surrounds certain restaurants in the SGV area and this has been one of the few restaurants that I never had the chance to visit until now (rather, I simply could not find any logical reason to wait outside that long to be seated; but, a brother's birthday dinner made it all fall into place). He ordered the following dishes: 1. House Special Lobster - so this dish is what all the hype is about? Seriously? It's just okay... X_X" The presentation was fun to look at, the taste just fitting for its price, and definitely not all that special. 2. Fish maw soup - one of my all time favorite soups in Chinese cuisine. I found it to be prepared just right and enjoyed its subtle flavors that blends in so well together. 3. French style beef - the reviews weren't kidding or over-hyping when they claimed the beef in this dish as tender and juicy. They didn't mention, however, that its unevenly salty, lol. I still enjoyed it except for the two pieces that made me finish the contents of that teapot like a parched desert crossing camel. 4. Fried tofu - can it get any better than this? Naw, no chance. Our tofu plate came out so well that I stopped eating anything else and slowly savored the flavors (first without and then with the sauce). One thing though is the jalapenos in the sauce should not be eaten with the tofu, lol. I could not taste the tofu at all when I had it together with the jalapeno slice. 5. Chinese broccoli with garlic (instead of oyster sauce) - weirdest thing to say is that this was my highlight dish for the evening. I loved it. I f**king loved it. I seriously mf'ing loved this dish. I must be one of the lucky ones to get this dish done perfect and all I can say is, can i order CLONE this dish for all my meals? Yeah, I think you get it. Garlic was cut in large chunks, slightly browned, and flavored the rest of the dish perfectly without the need for oyster sauce. Simple, but genius. Overall Review: Service is great and up to standard for an establishment like this. I enjoyed the dinner but cannot rate it higher than 3 stars in respect to all other similar restaurants. Why? For a seafood restaurant, I expect to be taken by the seafood dishes. We ordered two, one came out "just right" meaning, its expected to taste like that. The other one (lobster) fell short of my expectations especially with all the hype that surrounds it. Not to mention, my highlight dish was a vegetable of all things that did not have a trace of seafood in it (unless you used the same wok to cook something else a second ago). However, I will be back again to try out the seafood items and update my review and ratings accordingly.

This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in SGV. I usually go to the one that's on Las Tunas where the old Marie Calendar's used to be located. I've gone to Tan Cang during lunch and dinner on several occasions. The service is pretty good, and the food is great! My family and I ordered the fried fish, clams in black bean sauce, and the house special crab for lunch one day. The fish was really crispy and fresh. I was a little scared of the clams because I've had my share of bad clams before, but I'm glad I overcame my fear and tried their clams. The clams weren't rubbery or overcooked..they were perfect and seasoned well in the black bean sauce. The house special crab was amazing! Of course Tan Cang is known for their crab and lobster and man... I would totally go back over and over again just for the crab. Perfectly seasoned and meaty-- it didn't have any fishy taste to it. An excellent meal at an excellent price! The only con about this restaurant is that it's always super packed, so you should expect a wait that could be from 15 minutes up to an hour.

I've been to Newport several times already but never reviewed it. The food here is pretty good. I've tried on different occasions: - lobster (a must, after all, they have a lobster logo at the entrance) - kung pao chicken (which was pretty good) - filet mignon (it's okay) - seafood noodles (which was good) - clams (which was very good) - crab with asparagus soup (which was good one time and delicious another time I tried it) - shrimp with walnuts (good) - chicken krapron (Let's just say the name is "appropriate", if you are speaking "Engrish") I think I am forgetting a dish or two I have eaten before. I've eaten in the semi-private (secluded) and the open area tables. I obviously prefer the circular tables in the secluded area. The decor of the restaurant is pleasant, especially for an authentic Asian restaurant (and not one that's fusion/Americanized Asian places). Parking is an issue. Carpool when necessary. They have a small lot but you can find street parking with maybe a few laps around the block. When I was in the semi-private area, you got better service there. Last time I was there,I was in the open-spaced area, and the service needs improvement. But, overall, from the handful of times I have been there; I've been pleased especially with the food.

I love, love, love this place for an Asian style family dinner. 蔕f course the most popular dish is the lobster, and everyone knows that! 蔅ut my favorite dish is the sashimi elephant clam and their battered and fried version. 蔍t's my most favorite dish there. 蔍 wouldn't recommend the fried rice or their lettuce wrap. 蔍t didn't taste that great compared to the other items on the menu. 蔜he meal could get pricey though...usually for about 10 people, the bill comes out to a little over $300, but we like to order the expensive stuff...hehe! This place will always bring back memories for me since I use to work in that building when it use to be Marie Calendars.

When you walk in here, you will notice most (if not all) of the tables have something in common... they all have the big plate of seasoned lobster. That's what it's known for, it has great flavored and cooked well, and comes highly recommended. Other than that, this place is surprising because the level of food quality is high for all their other dishes besides just their special. The seasoned clams are delicious. Fish. The soup is tasty. And the seasoned cubed French styled beef cubes was clearly the surprise hitter as that was actually probably my favorite of the bunch that I tried. The beef cubes are tremendously tender, flavorful, and delicious. Nicely displayed on a bed of lettuce and the portions are decently sized. Clientele is mostly Asian, but there is still a little diversity spread in amongst the crowd. Front service and waiters all speak English so that's no problem. If you like Asian seafood (especially Chinese style), you should definitely visit and try their excellent food.

You're my lobster. (Anyone get the reference?) Ok. You can't come here and not get the house special lobster. Look around, everyone is eating them up. It's lobster genocide. Gangsta. Btw, this isn't your "Red Lobster" species. This baby is on steroids. It comes out quick b/c they deep fry it and douse it with onions and jalapenos and fish eggs. If you don't like it, you must be crazy. Tips: As always, market price for lobster is pricey. If you want to avoid the chaos, order it to go.

Known for the House Special Lobster, this was a must order, right? 蔍 was told that the minimum order was 4 lbs. 蔄t $16/lb, you would expect a massive amount of food, right? 蔠hen the dish came out, it was a sight to behold, chopped up lobster in manageable pieces wok fried in some special sauce and garnered with onions, peppers, and chilis. 蔄lthough tasty, this was not 4 lbs. of lobster. 蔍t may have weighed 4 lbs, but this is including the weight of the dish. 蔠orth $50+, not really. The French Style Beef Loc Lac, however, was a totally different story. 蔔ice cuts of super tender beef, in a salty, peppery, tangy marinade/coating was a thing of near perfection. 蔍 could eat this stuff all day and be very happy. Would I come back? 蔣es, but not for the lobster. 蔍 don't have the kind of money to pay for platters that I'm not allowed to take home, LOL.

Great food and fast service. We arrived 10 minutes to closing and they took us without hesitation. In 10 minutes we got our food and they did not hurry us out. The lobster is DELICIOUS. They fry with a mutltitude fo condiments that make it so tasty. The French style beef was equally well done although the meat could have been more marbled and less sinewy. The kailan with dried fish was done to perfection with no overcooking of the vegs. I would recommend this place without hesitation.

Come early on weekends, like before 6PM if you want to eat here without having to wait for a table and deal with the parking, which is a total CLUSTER. Otherwise, be very, very patient. We had a party of 22 for my mom's bday (and showed up around 5:30 to avoid aforementioned CLUSTER)...basically two big round tables. First table was family, and second table was for "surprise guests" aka my mom's friends whom she didn't know were coming. I was soo nervous that this was not going to come together the way I planned, table #2 was super late, and patrons were starting to come in who were angry that the restaurant was holding this super big table for us for like 30+ minutes. (Good thing my mom was totally clueless, meanwhile my sister and I were sweating bullets!) So major PROPS to the restaurant for doing that, they didn't have to! They actually have a no reservation policy on weekends, so I thought that they went above and beyond for us. In case you were wondering like I was, YES they can put a cake in their fridge for you. Food was amazing. Like every single one of the plethora of dishes was good, except maybe the clams. Table favorite was their steamed fish with sweet and sour sauce. MMmMMm sooo tender and tasty...and of course the lobster. This restaurant gets minus one star however for automatically doubling dishes like kung pao chicken and french style beef cubes for big tables, so you get charged double. Sneaky sneaky! Tell them NOT to double these dishes if you don't want them to...or else they will automatically and not tell you! The total for both tables was $700. Not cheap but amazing food! And well worth it for mommy's birthday. =)

So went to this place with my wife's family for a Sat dinner. We got there at 5pm and yeah.....It was wall to wall packed with people. Parking....if you find a spot in the small ass parking lot. Then consider yourself lucky. Note: I saw a lady and her kid almost get hit by this car in the parking lot...WTF! Yeah it was busy. Waiting area...it got so busy that I got claustrophobic. I had to wait outside half the time. Waiting for table.... if you have a party of 10 or more. Welcome to the world of 2 hour waiting. Yes it was busy as fuck. People running here and there and loud. When the people at the table you are going to be seated at is getting ready to leave. The waiters come over to your spoke person of your group and you can preorder your meal so it will come out shortly after your seated. Good attempt at be quick and efficient. The Food.....lets be honest. People don't fucking come here to go through all the shit listed above if the food wasn't good. Yes it was definitely was good and beyond. Would I come back.... maybe but not with such a big group and come at a better time.

Kung Pao Beef only item we didn't like was Kung pao beef. beef tasted and felt like beef jerky. But all other foods are excellent. not so busy during lunch time so try this place for lunch first. friendly staff with good service. we go to this place probably once a week.

It's hard to believe there is only one review for the place, it was pretty packed with diners at lunch today. A good friend of mine treated me to lunch, and said it was his current favorite Chinese food restaurant. Being that he has excellent taste in food, and is Chinese by birth I was really excited to try it. They've done a nice job of decorating an old Marie Calendar's space. About the only reminder are a few brick walls, and the new look is a semi hip upscale. It's lacking alot of the cheesy style usually found in this type of place, so that's a welcome relief. Service was okay, pleasant if not earthshattering but it was timely and we got what we ordered. The food was solid, if not the exquisite experience I was hoping for. We order beef cube steak, it was nicely cooked but not as tasty or as good texture as this Vietnemese restuarant off Fremont on Valley (can't remember the name at the moment). 蔠e had some good shrimp, the type you have to peel yourself and it was quite good and the serving was plentiful. Lastly we had some fish on lunch special, had a nice taste and was firm just the way it should be. All in all it was good, I can see how it might be really good for dinner so I'm looking forward to trying it then. Food - A- Ambience - B Service - B+ Value - B+

Everyone talks about the house special lobster. I think it's delicious, but worth the $55? (for small) I'm not sure if it is. It wasn't too crowded and i quickly found parking, that's a good sign. Waited for about 15-20 minutes on a thursday night for a party of 3. There were a decent amount of people, not packed. Looks pretty clean for a chinese restaurant. Servers were very friendly as they gave us the menu. The menu was in 3 different languages, english, chinese and vietnamese. rather stranger, but i later found out the restaurant has vietnamese influence, or even viet-chinese owned? i'm not sure about the latter. Ordered spicy clams, tong choy, garlic shrimp and the house special lobster. the first two dishes came lightening fast was was super hot. The portions were generous! The clams were very fresh and flavourful. the tong choy was a little salty for my liking, but it was still very well cooked. the shrimp was alright, and again, very hot! The house special lobster was fresh, and it was pretty big, but i guess in the end there wasn't that much meat. although 4 dishes is quite a lot for 3 people. It was a little strong for my palate. When i eat fresh seafood, i much prefer them to be milder in taste. i am cantonese after all! but unfortunately it was pretty overwhelming with the sauce, and i could barely taste the lobsters original flavour. regardless, it was still very well cooked and fresh. pretty good service for a chinese restaurant, they even refilled water, what?! and a little strange since there were hispanic servers? but then that could attract a more diverse (and it does) demographic. The bill came to $101 for 3 people. a little steep if you ask me, mainly the lobsters which ended up to be $55! everything else was $10-13 Tip: House lobster is pricey but you come here for it. small for 3 people, medium for 4+. lobsters run around $15-16/lbs and a small is usually around 4 lbs. Be sure to specify. They do accept credit now! portions are pretty big, so around 1 plate per person is good. Comes with rice ($1.50) Favourites: food is FAST and HOT. well cooked Do not want: a little strong for my taste, since it's viet/thai influenced. I expected a canto restaurant, and that wasn't what i got. Last words: Fresh lobster/seafood. Come at your own risk!

Loved this place! My bf and I took our good friend here for his birthday cuz we knew he liked seafood. We started out with the sweet and spicy catfish soup....to be quite honest, it wasn't very good. Not my cup of tea! It was a bit flavorless and had a weird tanginess to it... For entrees, we had to order the lobster! It was about $12.99 a lb, and surprisingly cheaper than the $13.99 for crab. It's a 4lb min, and definitely enough for the 3 of us (since we ordered other dishes too). We also ordered their house special chow mein, which was a mix of seafood and meat Hong Kong style crispy. Delicious! To add a little "apple" with these oranges, we ordered their beef cube! It was definitely the most flavorful out of the whole bunch. As for service, it was great! The staff was very attentive, and constantly came by to refill our drinks and give us new plates every time we scarfed down our crustaceans! For all four of those dishes, it cost about $100 with tax. Pretty good portions for the price! I'm going to be frequenting this place every time I'm craving for some good seafood or in the area! Come on a weeknight, as I hear that it gets pretty packed. We went on a Wednesday night, and it was pretty busy for a weeknight. Imagine a weekend!

Although I was initially distracted by the two nasty white dudes with their cumulative four mail order brides sitting across from us, the five pound lobster we ordered quickly diverted my attention from their table and towards the unbelievably amazing dish I was about to devour (with the help of two others.) We ordered the hot and sour soup (the real kind), chicken feet salad (spicy!) and the lobster. It was $130 (that's including the tip) so all in all, it was an expensive but amazing meal. Did I mention how amazing it was? Amazing. Amazing......amazing.

I always like the "VIP" rooms off to the right side because Simon, the waiter is pretty cool. 蔊ood man. We ordered some fish that was $51 which was ridiculously large but tasty, just too expensive for a Chinese joint. Crab was about $30 which was alright, but I would rather just go to Boiling Crab for this. Again, Order Shaking Beef and it's all good here.

I love this place. I hate the wait, and there always always is one, but I'm giving it 5 stars because the food is worth the wait. It's vietnamese inspired, but I think it's a fusion restaurant, borrowing the sweet/salty/tangy flavors of similar foods like Chinese, Thai and Malaysian. They have a set dinner for large parties, which is what we usually get, but you can also swap in/out other entrees I think. Come on people, don't come here and crowd the restaurant with your 蕂range chicken or fried rice orders. You're killing me. Things you should try: fried calamari, luc lac (vietnamese style filet mignon cubes with black pepper sauce, AMAZING) their wonderful house special lobster, 蔴ouse special fish (a whole fried fish topped with spicy/sour/sweet sauce), a savory sour fish soup. Oh man. Delicious.

Crowded, hole in the wall, Cantonese style Chinese seafood joint pretty much sums this place up. I must say the service here is the best I've had at an ethnic Asian joint though, water and tea were never empty and they were nothing but friendly. The also speak Vietnamese, Cantonese, and Mandarin which makes bringing my family plus my boyfriend's family easy since everyone can speak to the wait staff. The food here is really good if you order what they're famous for. I really like their house special fish and lobster complete with garlic, scallions, and peppers. Some people said they didn't enjoy it because it was too sauced up, but that's Canto food, and I love it. I guess I grew up dousing everything in fish sauce so sauces are my thing. I went back a second time and I had a few things that weren't as good but I wouldn't dock them for it, you just have to know what to order. The sauteed pea sprouts and water spinach were garlicy and buttery. Their sweet and sour pork rib things not so much and the tofu soup was a little bland. Bo luc lac also delicious as was the salt pepper squid and shrimp. I take all my out of town friends here who are craving a Vietnamese/Cantonese style seafood bonanza. The oranges are sweet even though they look strangely off color, go figure. Beware parking is a pain in the ass because between this and Golden Deli, the shopping center is incredibly packed and be prepared to wait in line. Though they do seem to take reservations for big parties.

Dear Newport Tan Cang, Your waits are atrocious, you force us to sit at very small cramped tables, and your service is as expected rushed and impolite. That I've come to terms with for any authentic chinese restaurant and things I can overlook at your delicious selection of seafood. My group was set back at the costs of the lobster tipping our pricing scale per person but every dish was delightful and well made. The comparison of dishes like your sol fish compared to West LA dishes is night and day. The texture, the flavors, and seasonings definitely jump out at you. Though I think I probably won't splurge as much as I did last time with the lobster, I'll definitely be back for your clams, fish, and other sea food delicacies again. Cheers, -Ed

8 dishes, 4 TsingDao beer, and $170 later... equals 6 happy fat people.

Lunch menu was all about $5.00. Clams with basil sauce, deep fried shrimp, whole fried fish were all fantastic. We had gringos in our group and were obliged to get kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef(don't fling shrimp heads at me). All for the grand total of.... just under $34... and very pleasantly full.

Love it! 蔅ut if you end up going at dinner, it's fine too. 蔍 always get the fried tofu (thin crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy in the inside), garlic basil clams (I could just drink the sauce!mmmmMM), and the lobster special or the crab special. 蔍f you notice the people around you, you will notice that almost allll the tables gets one of these. 蔄nd that should probably tell you, you should get one too!!!! So flavorful, it'll make you want to lick your fingers! I finish my meal with some fresh young coconut. and I'm happy as I can be. It's the best chinese/vietnamese restaurant I've been to. 蔉ood is served fresh, service is AWESOME! What more can I ask for? I'm in chinese food heaven!

Yummy lobster! Always packed when I come here. This is the place to go for fresh flavorful lobster. Friendly staffs. I always pick out the lobster eggs. It's not caviar, but it has a very distinct flavor. This is my place for great lobster! Call ahead and get a number during dinner time! This place gets so busy during dinner, it's unbelievable!

So, I didn't have the lobster like other yelpers have raved about but went for some good lunch special deals. The wait was about 20 minutes on a Sunday so it wasn't too bad. The interior looked very modern asian fusion and clean overall. The food was definitely worth the money. I may consider coming back for lobster in the future... MENU: on the house hot and sour soup as soon as we sat down, salt and pepper pork chops, salt and pepper shrimp, beef chow fun, basil clams, and rice PRICE: ~$7/plate (family style) fresh's 2 CENTS: if you're in the area and you want some delicious clean tasting chinese food with a twist, newport seafood is the place to go.

Based on the mostly positive Yelp reviews, I decided to check this place out. I love family style Chinese restaurants and have been to a lot, so my standards were fairly high before coming here. Here's what I tried-- *Boba: 蔝tterly disappointing. The tapioca balls were so stale that I had a difficult time sucking them up the straw because they were hardened. Say what?! They also use coconut milk in their milk tea, which was prevalent in even my first sip. Make sure you pass on this! *Crab and Shark Fin Soup - This is one of my favorite Chinese soups of all time and this place makes it well. They use just the right amount of white pepper to add the perfect kick to this already clear, comforting, fresh seafoody soup :) *Lobster - This is their specialty! It was good, but FREAKING expensive! The plate cost $120!!! The seasoning was really good and it came with a lot of meat, but still...I can't justify that price. *Kung Pao Chicken - Exactly what you would expect from any fancy Chinese restaurant. The chicken pieces came mixed with peanuts and some peppers, which added some more texture to the dish. *Chinese Broccoli - Very disappointing actually. The broccoli itself was cooked okay, but it came smothered in way too much oyster sauce. It overpowered the entire dish! *Green Beans - One of my favorite vegetables to get at any Chinese restaurant! Instead of using the red spices, they tried to keep it lighter and instead used a small hint of garlic salt. The beans are lightly pan fried, which made them slightly crispy and very tasty! *Crispy Noodles with Seafood - Pretty good, although the bottom noodles were soggy as usual - I hate how that always happens! I wish they would use less sauce, but the seafood that came on there was super fresh. *Mapou Tofu - Good, but nothing special. I'm kind of scared to know, but my guess is they used MSG in here. I wouldn't recommend it if you're trying to stick with healthier options because it came with a pretty thick glaze, as this dish usually does. *Peppered Beef Steak - Suuuuper yummy! Quite possibly my favorite dish!!! The cubes of meat were very tender and came sauteed in just the right amount of onions and fresh pepper. I would definitely order this again! I think we got a couple of other dishes, but I can't quite remember everything. Most of the food was generally good, but too expensive for the prices. At least I know the seafood is really fresh, considering they even have an aquarium in there! ;) With that being said, I understand why this place is pricey - this is definitely one of the most upscale Chinese restaurants I've been to. First, it's a grade A restaurant. It's super clean inside and they have nice booths. Second, they have valet parking here (seriously? in San Gabriel!? This isn't WeHo, peeps!). Third, the service is excellent here! The waiters are extremely attentive and they change your plates out frequently for you. That is such a rarity for a Chinese restaurant, so I definitely give them big props for their cleanliness, good service, and just ritzy appeal. I definitely prefer other Chinese family-style restaurants to this place. Shoot, being Asian, I really prefer hole-in-the-wall joints where I get more bang for my buck, but these fine dining experiences are nice every once in awhile :) I probably wouldn't come back here though, since I know a lot of better [and cheaper] restaurants. One thing I noticed - I guess a lot of young people come here because I kept getting stared at by random guys. It almost makes me think this is sort of a pick-up place, although I did see a lot of families here! Weird.

I've been here 2 times now. 蔜he first time..the food was AMAZING! 蔍 don't need to talk about the other food except for the LOBSTER. 蔜he lobster was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so yummy! 蔍 love mixing the sauce with my rice.....totally Asian style! The 2nd time....the lobster was a bust. 蔋ence my 3 stars. 蔜he lobster was overcooked, lukewarm, and really chewy...almost like rubber. 蔒y friends and I couldn't even finish half. �When you pay $80+ for the lobster....I expect it to be perfect! �Newport Seafood....you were good that one time. 蔍'm not sure I'll be back any time soon.

Went here with my mom and spent a chunk of change here due to the Newport style lobster, which was worth every penny! 蔍t made me so happy to eat such yummy seafood. Whichever beef my mom ordered was also delish (think it's Vietnamese/French style) that had onions and tomatoes underneath. Excellent service too. The guy helped us order and even told my mom to not over-order (cuz she was). 蔜he only drawback was the lack of parking due to the popularity of this place. What do you expect if the place is good? 蔠e waited for 45 minutes to be seated. Sounds bad but after waiting for 2 hours at the El Tovar restaurant in the Grand Canyon a couple of days earlier, it wasn't too bad. 蔊reat place! 蔠ill return.

By far the best Chinese Seafood Restaurant in LA! I loved it so much I went back the next weekend. Tried their Walnut Shrimp and House Crispy Chow Mein the first round. Then, came back for a revenge match and had the Lobster with spicy sauce and the Filet Mignon cubes! I'm already contemplating what to order next time....Ah yes, Crab! Parties 4 or less get seated rather quick. Remember, no reservations! So, if you are planning to bring along a battalion of hungry people...please come during off peak hours! Love this place!

Me and the boys did very well a few months back in the stock market. 蔜here was one position we were all heavy in, and it skyrocketed. 蔛o what do we do? 蔔ormally we get piss drunk in ktown along with some kbbq... or perhaps a Mastros dinner with bottles of wine and all sorts of appetizers... but since my friends have never really had chinese food before , we chose this place. 蔭nd we splurged hard. * Crab meat sharks fin soup - was not bad, but not great. 蔵ve had much better. * Newport Special lobster - i think im a lobster snob. 蔮ut i just cant stand lobster in the US.. and i dislike it more when american lobster is cooked asian style. 蕋he meat isnt as chunky or fluffy as the australian ones. 蔵 think ive been spoiled by eating lobster in australia and hong kong as a kid... but this place really is jsut whatevers. 蔵f youve never had lobster outside of the US, and never had it asian style, then you might find this to be awesome.. but to me its just ok. 蔱sp after hearing it was a viet style lobster, i just wasnt wowed by it. �* Peking style pork chop - not bad at all... then again, you cant really mess this dish up. * Beef loclac french style - perhaps the only dish that exceeded expectations. 蔰amn tasty. * Clam with spicy hot sauce - i love clams, and i love spicy... this was actually a really good dish. * Steamed whole fish - nothing special. then we also had an assortment of different veggies with meat, all not really worth mentioning because theyre plates taht taste the same at any respectable authentic chinese restaurant. We were mostly disappointed at the meal. 蔵t was average, but overhyped. 蔒ost of us grew up in norcal too, so a lot of us actually preferred eating PPQ or Thanh Long's dungeoness crab with garlic noodles up in San Francisco over this lobster. We had 6 people, and our bill was about $500.... so yes, we did have a lot of lobster.... Would I come back here? 蔉or the beef loclac, yes... for the lobster, no.

Whenever you go to a restaurant and the word "seafood" is part of its name, the expectations are pretty high. Unfortunately, things fell a little short when it came to a few of the seafood offerings at Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant while one non seafood dish really got my attention in a very good way. A group of us from my dining group shared a total of 8 dishes starting with the Braided Crab Meat and Fish Maw Soup. Unfortunately, this is one dish I wouldn't order again. It was completely bland. The addition of soy sauce and some chili paste was definitely needed to add some flavor, but even then, it wasn't an appealing dish. Also, it felt as if corn starch was used to thicken the soup and too much of it, which made the texture a little unpalatable. On the other hand, the House Lobster was not only a thing of beauty and looked quite impressive on the plate it arrived in, it was absolutely delicious. The flavors of the lobster took on a lot of garlic and onion notes as well as a lot of other fantastic spices, but the meat itself was also quite succulent. What I also appreciated was that the Lobster was already cut up in pieces and the claws cracked for easy access to the meat. The French Style Beef Loc Lac that followed the Lobster was a dish I'd expect to see more in a Cambodian or Vietnamese restaurant, but thank goodness, it was a part of this meal. The beef, which I think was cooked with soy sauce, black pepper and some kind of tart citrus, really made my taste buds happy. The beef was also amazingly tender which is definitely a reason why this dish is a must order. When it came to the House Special Trout, the presentation was something to behold. The fish was twisted this way and that way and looked like a piece of art. I enjoyed the crispy skin and mild and delicate fish meat. Unfortunately, I found the sauce a tad too sweet and hard to avoid since the entire fish was drenched with it. There's something to be said sometimes for ordering food with sauce on the side. The next to arrive were the Clams with Spicy Basil Sauce. It was nice to see that the clams were actually a pretty good size and even more importantly, all the shells actually had clam meat in them, which isn't always the case in my seafood dining experience. Other than the clams being a tad too chewy and the sauce needing to be more spicy, this dish wasn't bad. Our final three dishes weren't that exciting. The Kung Pao Chicken lacked even a little bit of heat while Vegetable Deluxe was absolutely tasteless. At least the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops were seasoned well and I liked the jerky, chewy texture of the pork meat itself. Overall, my meal at Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant was uneventful with a couple of really high notes in the House Lobster and the Beef Loc Lac. Considering that this has only been my first visit and we tried only 8 dishes, I would need to come back a couple more times to get a better feel for their food. However, because of this one first impression, I don't feel the desire to make a repeat visit any time soon.

Newport has moved to its new location down the street into what use to be a Marie Callendars. 蔜hey've completely remodeled it into a modern restaurant, with chinese flair. 蔜heir lunch specials are cheap and good....can't ask for much more. 蔍'm not the biggest fan of sauteed, fried, or otherwise oily chinese food - but if I have to choose a chinese style banquet meal, Newport is a decent choice. The one bad thing about their menu is the vast majority of prices are not listed (unlike most places that have only a handful of "MP" items). 蔈ven the pretty standard items are not priced. 蔜heir lunch menu is different though - most prices are listed on that one - and they're all reasonable. 蔛ervice is a bit brusque and rushed, but maybe that's because they're really busy....plus it is a chinese restaurant in SGV so you can't expect top notch service. Overall: 蕆ecommended.

I used to go to this restaurant several years ago when it was across the street, further west of this current location. 蔅ack then it looked like a typical Chinese/Thai/Viet restaurant - not that clean, loud, good food & cheap. The decor here is artsy & cleaned up. 蔜he waiters were constantly swinging by to see if we needed anything & swapping out our plates as soon as I put something in my mouth...I actually was wondering if they could just leave my plate 'cos I'd JUST re-added more hot sauce onto my plate - (hopeful look at waiter) - NOPE. Food was good - not spectactular - not sure why everyone is saying it's to die for or whatever. 蔄nd for $113 before tip, getting the 5 dishes wasn't cheap but wasn't expensive - so it's not like you're getting an awesome deal in pricing either. 蔍 preferred it when it was cheaper decor & cheaper pricing for the same quality of food across the street. 蔜he quality of the seafood was really good but you can get that at most of the other seafood/dimsum restaurants in SG, Alhambra, MP. Ordered: - House special lobster (liked the lobster egg pieces that came with it but the sauce was just okay...for some reason I thought it would be more garlicky) - Fried shrimp in salt/pepper (definitely used fresh shrimp as the shell was very crisp & it was easy to devour the shrimp whole) *thumbs up* - Clams w/ Thai basil leaves & jalapenos (kinda bland - will order my usual fav with black bean sauce next time) - Beef Chow Fun (where's the noodle?!? 蔜asty but more noodle would've been nice) - French filet mignon & onions (very tender beef but that should be expected if they're really cubing a piece of filet) I would come here more often if the food was cheaper.

I finally gave in and decided to try this restaurant out, being its one of the highest reviewed restaurant in the San Gabriel Valley. I can't understand what the hype of this restaurant is about. There are better asian restaurants out there in the SGV, especially when it comes to the lobster dish everyone raves about. Our lobster dish was $15/lb for the lobster and the server suggested a 3lb lobster. When we received our dish, it did not look like 3 lbs nor did we receive the tail for our lobster (I'm sure i got over charged). My bill came out to be $70 for two people for lunch. 4 dishes, three at $5 each (special lunch) and my lobster at $50. Don't bother wasting your money here if you want good chinese food. this isn't a authentic chinese restaurant. Their more of a Vietnamese restaurant that serves dishes. After my meal, i can only conclude why this restaurant is highly rated cause their servers speak english.

People aren't kidding about the lobster. I have to say, the lobster here is one of the best I've had anywhere in dare I say it, the world. The sauce is more spicy and flavorful than most Chinese style lobster. They are enormous too, we asked for the smallest one and it was still about 4.5lbs. Also ordered the French style filet mignon shaken beef (bo luc lac). Those were excellent as well. Very tasty. Added some snow pea leaves for veggies and Tsingtao for liquid refreshment. Turned into a self-induced gorging. Parking can be pretty bad, and the place is fairly small. Go late or go early and you won't have to wait.

This place surprises me. 蔍 love their food. 蔋aven't had a dish that I didn't like yet. 蔜hey do have quite a number of spicy dishes on the menu. 蔛o order them mild if you need to, but they still taste amazing even if they're spicy. 蔍'm a big fan of their chicken and shrimp lettuce wrap. 蔛picy but I can't get enough. 蔍t's so addicting. 蔅ut their most popular dish is the Beef Loc Lac which is french style beef. 蔍t is sooooo tender it can melt in your mouth. �I would give them 5 stars because the staff and the food, obviously, is amazing. 蔅ut I do find it somehow inconvenient since there are people lined up at their doors by 11am when they open at noon. 蔄nd their parking lot is always full. 蔛o you'll always find cars parked down on the street on both sides of traffic. 蔄nd after lunch, the people flood back in by 6pm. 蔛o call if you must and request to have a table reserved, maybe you'll get lucky and take your reservation. 蔕therwise, first come first serve. 蔈njoy!

It took our family a long time to find a close match-up to Monkee's Seafood in Chinatown, and this is the closest we could find! The wait was about 45 minutes because it was a Saturday evening right around the dinner rush. I guess it's not too bad...gotta remember to go a bit earlier next time, though! So we usually like to order the salt and pepper squid/shrimp, and I would have to say the squid is melt-in-your-mouth delicious! We always always finish this dish. I guess it's like a Chinese version of calamari, but no sauce is needed since it's already seasoned. Now, this place is more known for their lobster, but we tried it last time and I think I prefer the crab. Maybe I just love the crab with black bean sauce...takes me back to our days at Monkee's. Sorry, that was the second time I've mentioned another Chinese seafood restaurant. Anyway...another black bean sauce dish that we order is the clam. I don't like clam so I didn't have any, but from the reaction from my family, it must have been really good. There was none left by the end of dinner... Out of all their vegetable dishes, I would say the peasprouts are the best. They are these almost alfalfa-like sprouts that are crunchy and refreshing-tasting, with a little bit of that vegetable bitterness that is totally complimented by the saltiness of the dish. I don't even know if I'm describing it correctly, but it's pretty dang delicious! We also ordered the seafood pan-friend noodle that came out in, oh, I want to say...2 minutes after we ordered it. I'm wondering if they just had it ready and then brought it out? Either way, it was still steaming hot and good. I have to say, the only thing is that they charged us for the steamed rice. I know that most places provide the rice for free...had I known, I would have had my fair share of rice...considering I paid for the tab. Oh well, I guess I know for next time. FYI it's 50 cents per person. ** Something that we like to do is flip over the main crab shell, mix in some rice and black bean sauce, some hot sauce, and scrape all the crab (insides?) together and eat it. OH MY GOODNESS SO DELICIOUS. Just wanted to add that as my own personal touch for this review. That's what reviewing is for, right? If you try it out and like it, let me know!

Thank you to all who reviewed. I trusted your review and took the family there for dinner. The food was really good. We ordered the five person meal for $58 which included Seafood Soup, Kung Pao Chicken, Salt and Pepper Crab, Clams with basil and garlic, Steamed whold fish with scallions and soy and garlci pea sprouts or chinese broccoli (we ordered the pea sprouts, yum). We also ordered a "small" lobster that was in no means small, house special Fried Rice and a Tofu and Mushroom dish. All of that fed 4 adults and a child with some left overs. This is the first time I've ever been served a whole lobster. We waited about 15 minutes for our table. I highly recommed this place. The hostess was very nice and I told her I read a good review about her on http://Yelp.com. You'll definitely get your money's worth. I forgot to mention that they are CASH only.

Bleh....nothing's bad here, it's just that pretty much everything I ate here I could get somewhere else better, cheaper, and without the ridiculous wait that most people probably have to go through when they come here. Came here with my dad (who is the ultimate Chinese seafood) critic and a bunch of his buddies..I came late and left early so I didn't know any of the waiting times they faced or how much anything cost but I'm assuming it was pretty expensive, so here's what I ate: -Deep fried chicken wings - It was alright..just seemed like something generic you could get at any Chinese cafe -Shrimp salad - Shrimps were good, but it basically tasted like a bunch of vegetables mixed with fish sauce -Seafood soup - filled with a bunch of shrimp, squid, etc which were tasty but the soup wasn't really soup, as my dad said it was basically just "MSG water" and lacked actual seafood flavor -Steamed Crab - I actually didn't get to try any because by the time the rotating thingy rotated to me there weren't any pieces left..I didn't mind though, I'm usually lazy anyways when it comes to having to use my teeth to maul crabs to get the meat out -Deep fried fish with sweet and sour sauce - Like the previous dish I didn't get to try much, but it tasted pretty good from what I had..King Hua probably makes their deep fried fish with sweet and sour sauce better. -Steamed fish -tasted good...but Big 3 does theirs just as well. -House special Lobster - the sauce was really good, but there didn't even seem like there was that much meat on it and the meat itself didn't taste like anything special -Basil clams - clams were pretty small and IMO covered in too much sauce..Full House's spicy clam pot has huge ass clams and is done better. -Stir-fried veggies - generic stuff...any Chinese restaurant can do this -Sea cucumber - Not a fan of sea cucumber so I just ate the vegetables it came with, generic -French-style beef - It was good, but yeah I think Big 3 does it better too. So all in all everything was alright, but the hype surrounding this place just knocks it down for me

The reviews of Newport Seafood tell the truth. This place has exceptional Chinese food. We ate Basil Fish (spicy), Salt and Pepper Shrimp (great blend of sweet and sour, not goopy, just crispy and fried with lime squeezed on top and sauteed garlic, scallion and hot pepper strewn over the whole shrimps), mixed vegetables and noodle beef. Everything was outstanding and we scarfed most of the food down. The staff were friendly and accommodating about our rambunctious 2 year old. Service was quick. Decor is above average (for Chinese banquet). And the whole meal was $31. Seriously. We travel to China regularly, and this ranked well against food we've had in country. We would even take clients here (especially if they took reservations...). We can't wait to go back with a group for dinner and do the House Special Lobster and Crab. The crabs in the tank were HUGE and the Lobster we saw on someone else's table made the mouth water!

Great place. One of my favorite places to go in the area. I always order the salt & pepper shrimp. Interestingly, their black bean sauce is the best I've tasted. The stir-fried pea sprouts are also good, and the house special beef is delicious. The crab and lobster dishes look and taste good too. The best part about this place is that they have a late lunch and 蕋he lunch specials are excellent - mostly in the $4 range and the portions are big. It's a popular place, but small, so go early or late if you don't want to wait in line. Otherwise, you're going to be behind a whole lot of people during the middle of lunch or dinner hours.

We came here for lunch on a Sunday around noon and it wasn't too bad. 蔍t was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect, other than knowing this place moved from another location down the street and is known for their delicious seafood but of course it don't come cheap! 蔠hen I first entered the place, I noticed this place was pretty clean and chic for an Asian restaurant. 蔍t's got semi-private rooms on side of the restaurant. 蔍 didn't realize this place offered lunch specials and the prices were relatively decent! 蔙oughly speaking, their lunch specials ranged from $6-$8 per place and included everything from vegetables, beef, shrimp, chicken, etc. 蔉or the 2 of us, we ordered the kungpao beef (which I totally recommend!), sauteed peasprout (which is basically sauteed in garlic and a hint of salt - so good and you must eat your veggies anyway!) and the fish fillet with basil. 蔍 didn't particularly care for the fish fillet with basil, only because I felt it still tasted a bit fishy and the flavor was nothing extraordinary. 蔍 thin 2 dishes is more than enough to feed 2 people. 蔄nd to top it all off after the lunch, they provide cut oranges. 蔄nd oh my gosh, the oranges are super sweet! 蔍 love this because most places offer some red bean or tapioca dessert, but the oranges were just so refreshing! 蔠ould definitely come again!!

Newport Tang has a lot of things going for it - awesome decor, good seafood and tons of people who are willing to wait hours for a chance to experience it. I'm not a seafood person. 蔅eing from northeastern China, I like my pork, beef, and duck and I like 'em cheap. 蔜he lobster (at $16/lb) was not too pricey for lobster but it was certainly an expensive dish at $68. 蔜he lobster looked delicious but it only tasted average. �The best part of the meal would have to be the French beef dish. 蔒aybe I only felt that way because I like beef a lot more than lobster. Luckily for us, we got there at the perfect time and were seated right away. 蔍f I had to wait a long time, I'm sure my rating would have been much harsher. The waiters walked by our table a hundred times during our meal but rarely volunteered to provide service. 蔉or example, when my plate was covered in lobster shells, I expected the waiter to come by and offer new plates. 蔔ope! 蔄lso, we had ordered beverages but they never came at all. Overall, it was a good meal but we definitely paid a hefty price for it. 蔉rom now on, I will stick to my meats with an occasional fish here and there.

This place was okay for a couple of times, but just had dinner there and had nice big pieces of hard shell in my food, seemed like oyster or some other sea creature's shell. 蔞ery sharp, nasty pieces. 蔄s for the Beef Loc Lac, or whatever it's called, you've got to be kidding--don't bother ordering this stuff. 蔜his place is highly overrated, unless you crave shells in your food, and maybe you do....

By far one of the best Chinese food places in the San Gabriel Valley-- a high compliment considering the plethora of good food in that area. I would recommend that you go to this restaurant with a couple of people at least 5-6 but you'd probably need more, because you will want to get the 266 set menu. This menu includes a great balance of both seafood and meat dishes. Let's go more in depth shall we.. 1 fried crab dish with a hint of green onions and tough of Chinese seasoning 1 garlic and saucy crab dish 1 pea sprout dish-- a good refreshing dish considering the really heavy and delish other courses 1 3 flavor kung pao chicken-- truly amazing: includes shrimp, beef, and chicken to which all three flavors mesh together and wow simply wow 1 abalone soup-- apparently real, but I'm not too sure since abalone is CRAZY expensive 1 orange chicken 1 sea cucumber dish And MORE If you can't go with a huge gaggle of people, I would just recommend to get the crab dishes, because that's their specialty. I do warn you that this restaurant probably uses a lot of MSG. An hour after eating, I 蕌ncontrollably toppled over and fell asleep. The restaurant dosen't sit many maybe at most 50 or so. So I'd recommend that you get there a wee bit early if your doing a lunch thing. Update: Apparently no abalone soup and or orange chicken thing on the 266 menu. I did go on Christmas so perhaps its a different menu or something. Anyhoo. yummo nonetheless!

The place is very busy. The wait is long. The food is good, a little on the salty side. The quality of the seafood seems to diminish with each visit I make.

I am a hardcore fan of the Newport Seafood in Santa Ana and was skeptical that this place would be as good. When we got there (Sunday at 5:45 p.m.) the place was completely packed - a very good sign. We couldn't even park. My mom had to run in to place a to-go order while my dad and I sat in the car across the street in a red zone. It turns out the Santa Ana location and this one are related! The original owner sold the Santa Ana location and opened this one, which is way cleaner and snazzier looking. The owners even remembered my mom from 20 years ago! How crazy is that? Anyways, the lobster was fantastic and met all my expectations. I don't know if I would say it's better but it's closer to where I live, nicer, and has the same price point.

Damn, Tan Cang Cook! This place is absolutely the place to go if you want to get your grub on. This place is my all time pick if you ask me where to go for Chinese/Vietnamese food. The staff is super nice and can probably speak any Chinese/Vietnamese/Thai/Laos dialect. They are very accommodating to how you want your food. I haven't had anything on the menu that I didn't like. What I do love: The deep fried whole fish with the garlic, basil, and chili sauce. This dish is my absolute favorite. I would hunt this fish down and catch it with my bare hands if they ever ran out. Thank god for me this would never happen, but you get what I'm saying right? Yes, it's that good. Their lobster is what people rave about, and let me just tell you, yes, that too is all that and more. If you get lucky, you might get a lobster with tons of eggs attached to it. Yum! This place is a must try. They don't have a wait list of at least an hour for nothin', they also have a security guard that tends to the parking lot for those crazy Asian drivers(like my dad) who ignores the right of way on who was there first or who even signaled first for that coveted space and they didn't move to a bigger and better location for nothing. You may on the other hand leave with nothing in your wallet since the lobster can set you back about $80 alone and the fish was $30 bucks. In total, we spent $250 well worth bucks on some good eats. Try it...you'll like it.

What more can I say about this place? If you want good asian styled lobsters, go here. I've been going to newport seafood for years now. I'm glad they moved to a bigger location. Even though its a bigger location, parking is still pretty bad. I recommend you grab the first street parking you see, especially on the weekends. There is still a wait but compared to the old newport, it's fairly short. Expect to wait 20-30 mins, depending on the size of your party. Here's what I typically order when I go there. 1. Basil Clams 2. Bo Luc Lac ( French style beef cubes), one of the best I ever tasted. Be sure to use the pepper and lime dip. 3. Pea sprouts w/ garlic 4. Deep fried Sole, awesome with the dip. 5. House Special Lobster, how can you come here and not order lobster? 6. Crab with fish maw soup. A meal like that will run you about $140 but will feed about 4. It's best to go with larger groups so you can order different dishes.

Most of the food is good not great. But the lobster dish was outstanding! It was the best asian lobster dish that I've had! Waited 45 mins but it was well worth it. I even took the left over sauce and fried it up with rice the next day. 蔜he clams were also phenomenal. All of the other dishes in our $288 set menu was good but not outstanding like the lobster and clams. Definitely still worth the money, because this type of dinner would of been about $400+ in the bay area of no ca. Wish they took reservations.

Best of all locations. 蔔ot only is the decor contemp and western, their service is excellent too. The seasoning on lobster is just right, not too salty or too peppery. 蔐obster has a lot of meat and to pair it with bowl of steamed rice with all the lobster bits and green onions is just mouth watering. 蔕rder one lobster and one of their set dinner menus and you are good to go. 蔜he set dinner menu is really tasty and portions are good. 蔅est kung pao chicken I ever had. 蔜he wait is about an hour which seems long for a Chinese restaurant but that's because this isn't your regular Chinese restaurant.

I'm not much of a lobster person myself but the lobster they serve here are pretty DELICIOUS. The crowd starts after 6:30PM and the wait will be AWHILE. Service wasn't bad. They refilled our water without asking and the dishes came out at a good pace. 15% gratuity is added for 6+. Lobsters ($16/LB): It depends on the season but $16 is quite pricey I must say. We ordered a MEDIUM and that was barely enough for 6. The meat was good and fresh, esp the sauce they made it with. Clams ($11): The clams were fresh as well, and there's no ocean taste to it. The sauce is a bit gluey but other than that, it's delicious! Salt & Pepper Squid aka Calamari ($10): The BEST calamari I've ever had! A bit oily but not too deep fried, very crispy indeed. Catfish Hot & Sour Soup ($11): It tasted very refreshing. The soup has catfish, tomato, pineapple, and bean sprouts. 蔍t was a bit sour only, but definitely not spicy. 6 People = $160 (gratuity included)

We went to Newport Seafood for the first time the other night. 蔜here were no reservations. 蔣ou get a number and wait for a table but they gave us a number over the phone when we said we'd be there in 20 minutes.

Came here on a Sunday night and alright the wait was about an hour and parking was packed, it was alright. Why? Well because it is well worth it. Once you've tired seafood prepared Asian style you will never go back to the American lameass franchises like Red Lobster (What a joke!) or Joe's Crab Shack. The new location is a lot nicer with decor and bigger location, however, it is still not big enough for all the customers waiting to get in. However, I do noticed a lot more White folks trying out this place. Yeah, that's right, I know you guys are not going back to the American seafood places ever again. Party of 10 people and the bill came out a bit over 300. Not bad and considering all the 2 giant lobsters we order, not bad at all.

Reading what other yelpers have said about the Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant, I thought that this place was going to be delicious... But I was sadly disappointed. 蔍 came here with my parents and my father's parents, who are pretty well known in LA Chinatown. 蔜he waiter who took our order was someone who knew my grandparents from way back. 蔋e recommended the $48 course meal, which was the seafood soup (I think?) (it was the soup with cabbage, squid, shrimp, beef, fish balls, and octopus), the meal included the chinese broccoli (gai lan), the kung pao chicken, clams and a fish. 蔠e also ordered the lobster and the French Style Beef. �The soup was just nothing special, people could make that soup themselves... The chinese broccoli was the basic broccoli that you can get in any Chinese restaurant too, but my grandparents didn't even eat it, because it wasn't tender enough. �The Kung Pao chicken was too crispy for my taste... and the chicken bits were pretty small. 蔍t was the basic Chinese dish, the flavored chicken with lots of peppers and cashews. �I tried the clams, but they were too spicy for me, but even so, my grandparents could tell that the clams weren't very fresh, and that they were shipped from somewhere overseas. �The fish was pretty good. 蔜hat was the only dish besides the lobster, that my grandparents really enjoyed. 蔜he fish was tender, and the sauce was pretty tasty, but I have had better ones at other places... The lobster was really delicious! It was my first time trying lobster, so I didn't really know what to suspect, but it tasted pretty good for my first time, and both my parents and grandparents agreed that the lobster was really good. 蔅ut we asked the guy who took our order down for a small lobster, and we got a 4.5lb lobster... that may be small, but there were probably smaller lobsters. �The beef was really tender, but I have had basically the same dish at other places, so it wasn't anything to rave about. �The service was really quick, about 5 minutes after we ordered, the chinese broccoli and the clams were served to us. 蔜he wait staff is really nice, and they always change your plates the minute that they see that your plate is full, and they were understanding when we kept asking for napkins. �This restaurant gets REALLY LOUD too... my grandparents complained about how loud it was, and how they had to speak extra loudly just to communicate with my parents and I, who were just sitting on the opposite side of the table. �Also, if you do come to this restaurant, you should go early, and HAVE YOUR WHOLE PARTY THERE, because they don't seat people whose full party isn't there.

I just cannot believe after countless time I went to Tan Cang, drove the crazy miles from West LA to San Gabriel and waited after the long lines - I never wrote a review about it. I must be loco. So does the house special lobster and everything else in Tan Cang. This restaurant is my favorite and apparently is also everyone else's - so prepare for a long wait during weekends. Although this place don't take reservation, on weekdays you may be seated right away. Let's spin that glass table: 1. french beef loc lac - black pepper beef cube sauteed to tenderness, on top of chopped onions. The beef is super tender and juicy - the best beef dish in any Chinese restaurants I've ever tried. I never get enough of these, give me a plate for myself!! 2. please don't lick the screen. of course the house special lobster is a must. chopped, battered, and lightly fried together with scallions, black pepper, drenched with some oil. No need to make a mess, just fork out the tender lobster meat, dip it with the oil and green onions. it sure is special. 3. kangkung or water morning glory. stir fried with chopped garlic and shrimp paste. the aroma and taste are equally appetizing. super good. It may not be on the menu, but you can have two cooking ways of the fish. I'm not sure whether they charge differently or not but to add varieties to the table, I greatly recommend splitting the fish. �4. first half of the fish: steamed tilapia with special sauce, ginger, and scallions. very delicate and buttery. 5. second half of the fish: deep fried and drenched with sweet sour sauce. uber spicy delicious crispy skin and moist inside. �pics - http://www.yummycrave.co�###Rainy L.

"Are you kidding me?!" is what I exclaimed when I took my first bite of the lobster. It was cooked perfectly, it tasted amazing, and the presentation was beautiful. We ordered the french style beef, ong choy (my favorite), fried squid, clams, and the lobster. Everything was delicious, all the food came out at the same time, and the service was right on. Every time I turned around someone was filling my glass with more beer and clearing dirty plates from the table. The captain waited on us and she was helpful and very friendly. We will be back!

Awful. Before Newport Seafood fans start rollling their eyes, please know that I am a huge fan of Newport Seafood and have been to all their locations, including the old San Gabriel one. Tonight was my first time at this location. I LOVE the Newport Special Lobster, but it did NOT taste the same here. It was missing something. Definitely in need of some salt. I am not kidding. We also got the sauteed pea sprouts and clams with basil, which were also lacking in flavor. Maybe it was the cook tonight?? Food aside, the service was mediocre. Now I know what my friend meant by "really nice place with ghetto service." Seriously, all the waiters and busboys were talking loudly. They were pretty obnoxious. I realized that only the servers were loud--the customers around us were not. And there was a loud noise coming from the back of the restaurant that sounded like someone was banging something against metal. It was annoying and to have that on top of the lackluster food made our experience a horrible one. I won't go back to this Newport Seafood location. Oh, and we ordered a small lobster (for 3 people). The lobster itself was $71 and some change. So not worth it.

Food was delish and fresh! service was friendly and attentive - they change your plates frequently. 蔐ong Line and Parking lot gets full quick. French Beer- serves 2, Amber Ale - Pretty Tasty House Special Lobster - 4.5 lbs came to about 72 bucks at 15.99 per lb. They top it with roe from the lobster as well! �How do they turn out the lobster that fast? we ordered and literally 10 mins later all our food came out!

This restaurant is the sole reason why I wished I lived in LA. Forget the beaches and fancy parties, come to San Gabriel to eat this lobster!! It is one of my all time favorite restaurants. They recently remodeled so it looks beautiful inside and there are little very cute sectioned off areas where you and your party can sit. The lobster is obviously pricey because it's lobster but so worth it. They prepare their lobster with so many spices and ingredients such as green onions and lobster eggs. Oh man, the lobster eggs are so GOOD!! You haven't lived until you've tried this. I am always tempted to ask for extra lobster eggs but the one time I did that, I got a weird look from the waiter. Even though Newport specializes in lobster, all of their dishes are stellar. 蔍've ordered their mussels, hot and sour catfish soup, beef luc loc and many others. The dishes here never fail. Newport goes above and beyond what my palette can ever desire.

from below... "They just moved to a new location, it was much more cleaner and we don't have to fight for parking space with other people who came for different shops, yay!!!! Always always order Lobster, never order Crabs from here, the sauces they used for Lobster are different, it's very yummy..." That's right on the money. The lobster we had was delicious and the snow crab was overpriced, overcooked and just unremarkable. Everything else was great. As mentioned below the french beef was wonderful as well as calamari that was the chunkiest I'd ever seen. Try the whole fried fish..the sweet sauce they serve it in was to die for. EDIT- I just went back to this place and it's now my favorite. My only problem was that I ate like there was no tomorrow. There was food flying everywhere. I wanna go back...NOW!

My favorite part about this place? My last name is in the name of the restaurant! This place is a really big family/big group dinner place. Weekend waits are horrendous. I personally think the wait is worth it though. If you're like my brother you could always come once your family has the seat ready. We actually tricked him once saying we had a seat and he actually came, and he still had to wait haha. My favorite dishes are the Honey Walnut Shrimp and Beef LocLac. My family also orders clams or something to that extent, some veggie dish, and a fish + the lobster. Everything here looks good. I'll always be like wow, that looks so good when other tables get their food. A lot of other yelpers have also named some good plates that's a good idea to check out. It's a really good place for like a small reunion of friends as long as someone knows what to order. Interior wise - The place upgraded a lot from it's last location. Just like it's last location the place has a long line, I think the wait is even longer now! The place also has lunch specials where they have dishes that cost from around $5 to $8. You can expect some dishes you like to be that cheap rather than the $15/plate. They also give you a soup for lunch before you get your meal. This place is worth 5 stars, but the wait is killer. You'll often see the younger people with their family always complaining and always saying they want to leave and they already ate. But honestly there's a difference between waiting an hour for food and waiting an hour for good food. I still dislike the wait though. But I really think the best part about this restaurant is once you're sat down you'll have a good time with whomever you're with. I generally don't like spending a lot of time with my family, but everytime we come here it's always fun. Fact for guys - Small restrooms suck.

Hate it when I couldn't give my real honest opinion on a restaurant. Exact situation happened for this one as well with the fact that I tried this place out with a stomachache gf. She pretty much hold me down while I'm tasting out the in-house special lobster. Weird case of r a Chinese restaurant to number their no.1 special as no.14 dish , but seems like the curse didn't work on this one... Pretty much every single table i ordered this particular over-priced dish. Got the small sized dish for just two eaters and damnnn the size is more than enough for the two of us! While u r there, try out the shaking beef or sth like that. Never failed to disappoint. Beef cubes stir-fried to perfection,with marbled texture, one of the best I have yet to try. The fried batter tofu is also a great masterpiece. Soft tofu with a thin layer of fried batter. Mouth watering! Definitely worth the try. Pride of San 蔊abriel. FTW.

I love this place. 蔜his is my new Chinese restaurant love. 蔍 think I'll have a love affair with this restaurant. Yes the house special lobster was completely delicious, I really liked that they took the roe out, cooked it and sprinkled it all over on top of the lobster. Yes, the curry crab was also very tasty, great flavors. But what I really appreciated was the excellent quality of the more "regular" dishes. �Clams with spicy sauce - beautiful, perfectly cooked clams. 蔅asil in the sauce. wow. Kung pao chicken - dried fried, great flavors, a touch of sweetness. 蔍t was really excellent, probably the best kung pao chicken I've had, and I've had this dish a lot! Even the rice was really good. Service was top notch. 蔉riendly, fast, and helpful. 蔈xcept at the end when they were rushing us to pay our bill, even though there were still many diners eating away. Next time I'll have to try their special steamed shrimp. Saw a large platter go by, and those babies were huge.

3.4.10: I came here several times, but I have not bothered to update until now. It is the New Year and the place has a new location that I have not written about yet. I really like the new location mainly due to the size. I did not feel crowded as I did in the past. In addition, the place has a contemporary and Chinese design feel to it, which makes the place looks fresh. �On to the food, I always felt as if their dinner pricing is on the pricey side. One day I decided to tag along to eat lunch here after Ultimate Frisbee. We ordered quite a bit of stuff: Fish Fillet, Clam with Basil, Calamari, Two chicken dishes and I cannot remember the rest. Lunch specials are good size portioned and priced. It was price along the lines of approximately $6-$9 a dish. Not too shabby considering the dinner menu on the average ranges from $13+. The food was delicious. I could not stop thinking how everything tastes so Mmm mMm good. I was super duper satisfied, I have gone two more time after this date listed and at all times I was super happy. Therefore, for those of you who may think this place are overrated or not worth it, think again! "Do a little dance, and get down tonight"

My streak of bad luck continues!! I assume it's because we came for Lunch and not Dinner. I took my friends out for lunch on a Sunday, expecting amazing food. I ordered a medium lobster, shrimp, the loc lac, clams, and pea sprouts. Truthfully, none of the dishes were really that great. The clams in basil sauce barely had any flavor, so disappointing because it's one of my favorite dishes of all time. The deep fried shrimp hadn't been fried enough, so they weren't as crispy as they should have been, nor were they very flavorful. The loc lac was probably the best dish...tender meat, a good salty seasoning, on a bed of yummy onions. And finally...the lobster. Overcooked by a LOT, and with NO flavor whatsoever. We had asked for it to be a little less spicy (on behalf of 2 of my friends), but I didn't expect it to have so little flavor! If they're gonna stir-fry the crap out of my lobster, it should at least have been seasoned well! But no...I got the worst of both worlds, overcooked and underflavored. Damn. After dropping about $140 for the meal, I feel cheated...maybe if I'd come for dinner, they might've had a better chef. I'd be willing to give this place another chance, but probably not anytime soon. Tis a shame.

If you order the steamed lobster, you may be surprised that it is not that fresh, as we found out today when ordering lobster, their signature dish. 蔜hey recommended ordering instead the house special lobster, which would have been too spicy for some of us. 蔖robably that would've disguised the fact that the lobsters are not being cooked live. Unlike other restaurants they don't take out the live lobster to show you before you order it. 蔜he other dishes, including the garlic clams and the geo duck, were better, but not so outstanding to warrant five or even four stars. 蔜he orange slices served at the end came from oranges that were not finished by other customers, again accentuating our overall impression that they're saving money by recycling the food served. 蔕n top of everything, the restaurant's look is Japanese, inappropriate for a Chinese restaurant considering how Japan tortured, raped, and killed so many Chinese during WWII. 蔄s already mentioned in other reviews, the menu is also in Vietnamese and some of the vegetables, such as the bok choy, are served with spicy garlic, more a Vietnamese than Chinese way to cook them. 蔍n the end, this Chinese-Vietnamese-Japanese seafood concoction of a restaurant would do a lot better if they had no reason to fear serving their steamed lobster, sans sauce. 蔉resh food makes all the difference. One reviewer says they bring the lobster to your table to inspect first before cooking. 蔠ell, they didn't do that for the 4 pound lobster we ordered. Must it 蔮e 5 pounds and up before it's served fresh, instead of being pre-packaged, frozen leftover from the previous day? 蔉rankly speaking, I didn't see any lobsters being taken to tables for inspection. The people who say this must be relatives of the owner.

Best asian style seafood in southern california. Upon the myriad of seafood restaurants in the 626 (must be at least 20 within a 5 mile radius) Newport outshines the rest. They are most famous for their Lobster, however thats not to belittle any of their other dishes. We also had the steamed ama ebi (I only the jap name), clams with basil, french styled steak. The service is the best you'll ever get at a chinese restaurant. They are super friendly, even call you sir/madam. They are quick and constantly come with clean plates so the crustacean shells don't pile too high. Place is pricey though. 2lbs of the shrimp will run $60. Thats about 16 large prawns. A small lobster comes in at slightly higher. So between the 4 of us we ate for $185, pre-tip. However, you certainly get what you pay for. I'm always willing to shell out extra for the higher quality.

The best lobster dish I ever ate. One plate of that baby can be shared by a party of five. Everyone gets a piece or two.. Its amazing, delicious, exquisite, heavenly, mouth watering, rich... and... and... you get the point. I could go on and on about it but you will never truly know what you've been missing in life until you take a bite. Its that good. We also ordered a plate of the french beef and chicken lettuce wrap. They were pretty good but will forever live under the shadow of that special lobster. Downside: Theres just not enough parking to accommodate all the customers and the wait time is about an hour. The rest of the dishes are pretty oily too so at the end of the meal we rinse our palate with a nice cold mixed fruit drink. Its a bit of shaved ice, condensed milk, and an assortment of chopped up fruits.. All i can remember was the Jack fruit. Its interesting. Service is awesome.. seems they have a staff of 20 servers who dart back and forth always looking out for that empty glass to fill. Fantastic. Great great place to eat but a bit on the pricey side so i couldnt possibly eat here as often as i'd like. I have a habit of frequenting my favorite places but alas this cannot be one of them.

Visited this restaurant because it was recommended to us by a friend. When we arrived at about 1:30pm, it was very busy. We finally got seated after 30 mins. We ordered the French Style Beef and the Basil Clams because it was a must have. We also added some noodles and pea sprouts. Once you get your order in, the food comes out of the kitchen very quickly. The food was great, and I thank Paul for the 411. The highlight of the afternoon was when I used the garnish that came with the beef (lettuce) as a vessel for the beef itself. I hit it with some lime juice and the salt/pepper mix perfect. I loved it so much Jenny requested more lettuce for me. All in all the service was great, food was good, and we will be coming back.

this place is no joke! we must have been very lucky since it was a Sat night and we were INSTANTLY seated for a party of five. The waiter was very helpful and convincing. We had the Newport Style Lobster, which was the size of a small child, sturgeon, French style beef, and some Chinese veggies. The sturgeon was so big it was cooked in two different styles, each filling up a medium sized plate. Salt fried and garlic steamed. The food showed up in a few minutes! Since we were very hungry, this added extra bonus points. MFG (muh-fugin-good!)!! This place is great for special occasions or depressing days.

During our first visit to Newport Tan Cang Seafood, my husband and I chose to forgo the House Special Lobster in favor of the crab. 蔠e went back to the new location last weekend. 蔄s a party of four, we had no excuse to pass it up again. �It was a cold, gray afternoon, so we were pleased to be presented with complimentary Hot and Sour Soup. 蔠e ordered a small lobster (about 4 lb.), and ate every last bite of it (except for some of the abundant roe). 蔜he dish itself is quite a sight to see, golden fried pieces of lobster with chunks of garlic and chopped green onions. 蔜he meat was mild-flavored and tender; the garlic and green onions, crunchy, fresh, and bright. 蔍n addition to the lobster, we ordered the dishes all Yelpers recommend: French Style Beef, 蔆lams with Basil, and Saut巈d Pea sprouts,. 蔜he peppery beef is nothing short of spectacular, especially when combined with sliced raw onion. 蔜he clams were meaty (scoop them up with plenty of sauce). 蔍 always order a vegetable dish at Chinese restaurants. 蔍 love these pea sprouts. 蔣ou may want to try them before the other dishes though (the flavor is more subtle). �Overall, servings are quite generous. 蔜wo of these dishes (clams and pea sprouts) were from the lunch specials menu, priced at $5.95 each. 蔔ot bad. 蔜he lobster was by far the most expensive item of the meal ($15.95 per pound). 蔍 don't think I will be having it regularly! 蔍nstead, I am curious to try some of the fish dishes and "sizzling plates." �Service was fast and efficient. 蔜he wait for a table was perhaps 15-20 minutes (not too bad for lunchtime on Saturday). 蔠e were initially seated at a huge circular table (for 8-10), but were moved to a booth upon request (by then, the lunch crowd had started to thin out). 蔜his new(er) location is definitely a step up from the previous one. 蔈ven the wait area is comfortable and pleasant. 蔍t is a great lunch option, especially if you are meeting up with family or friends.

My husband really liked the place. I thought it was quite good, though it was a little on the spicy and greasy side for me. We ordered the stir fry lobster ( came with tons of green onion, chili), sea bass (red sauce with lots of garlic), garlic basil clam stir fry, stir fry spinach, and the Thai style hot and sour soup. Maybe we just didn't order right but every dish was heavy with green onions and garlic. Don't get me wrong; each dish was good, but all together was too much. Service was not so good as we got there at 9:50pm and were told to put in our order even before we sat down. We were told that we could take as long as we wanted to eat afterwards. Our hot entrees came out first and the soup came out last. In the middle of our meal, the oranges came out and we were asked to pay our bill. We weren't even eating that slow (1 hour total for 3 ppl from sit down to walking out the door?). I definitely felt rushed and didn't appreciate it especially if the waiter said that we wouldn't be rushed after we put in the order and a bill of $185 for 3 ppl. Yes, I know it is to be expected when you come in 10 minutes before closing, but there were other guests at the restaurant. The servers and kitchen staff also started getting really rowdy towards the end of our meal. I know this is a chinese restaurant and most of them are like this, but I guess it rubbed me the wrong way that day. This is way it is so hard for Chinese restaurants to elevate themselves to fine dining with service quality like this.

HEAVEN. 蔜he food is incredibly fresh, the portions are humongous, and the flavors are fantastic. 蔠hen I say fresh, I am talking about the fish/shrimp/crab/lobster that comes straight from the tank, but 'm also referring to the vegetables. 蔉ood is often frozen in Chinese cooking in the U.S., so it's lovely to be eating food that was *just* prepared for like a minute and a half in a wok and then comes straightaway to the table. 蔜here's no weird white meat chicken that looks like it didn't come from an animal. 蔎ust pure yum. 蔍 LOVE Newport Tang.

New location is a lot nicer and upscale than the old location, which is good because those who have not been to Newport before are truly missing out. The house special lobster is to die for and their lunch specials are priced reasonably. 蔒ost weekends, the place is packed and there is certainly a good reason for it. You will not get the best of Newport without trying their lobster.

Tan Cang Clan ain't nothin ta F*** with! Things I liked: 1. fast and attentive service 2. AMAZING 6 lb. lobsters (bigger is better when it comes to lobster) 3. decent Chinese dishes. I would focus on the seafood starting from the lobster and moving onto the other seafood dishes. It was very pleasing to walk into the restaurant and see an orgy of big ass dungeness crabs in a tank. A blessing upon their suppliers. The only reason why I took off one star was that the first lobster we had was perfect but the second one was a bit salty. They also had a steamed clam dish with a sweet chilli sauce but it was bland compared to the other dishes. Otherwise this is a great visit that isn't too horrible of a drive from the OC.

Even though they open at 11.30 am, they let people in before that. The place is quite spacious but it gets packed pretty quickly. I came here with a party of 10. They wouldn't let us sit until most of us were there but they did set up a table for us right when we said "10". The Yang Chow fried rice was alright. I had have better. The salt & pepper shrimp was good. It was flavorful. I liked the pork chop. It was soft and tasty. The filet fish with basil leaves was also good. It's also pretty cheap, which is always a plus!

I have to give this place 5 stars because the food and the service (once you are seated) is really that good. 蔜he bad part is the long waits if you go at a popular time. Try the HOUSE LOBSTER with a side of vegetables and noodles. Don't be picky when asking for the veges - ask the waiter what is fresh and good that day - he will tell you. 蔜he rice comes with the meal but go ahead and ask for some noodle - the house special noodle is and added treat or get the fried Hong Kong Noodle. �So just remember: 1) be prepared for a long wait 2) eat a late lunch in case you are waiting awhile. 3) the waiter will help you decide but get the House Lobster.

I checked this place out because of all the positive Yelp reviews. We ordered several dishes but found everything to be OK (pea sprouts were tough, peking pork a tad dry, clams decent but not stellar). The house special lobster was the best and would be the one item I'd order again. (I wish I had read the reviews more carefully and also ordered the French beef!) I do have to say that this place has stellar service! The waiters changed our plate three times and kept the water filled. This place does deserve good ratings, however, because it is good value! I'd probably visit again when I'm in the mood for lobster.

Starbucks is to green straws as Chinese restaurants is to horrible customer service. But I was shocked to find that Newport breaks that mold, at least for my first time dining with them. I'm used to being ignored and needing to flag down servers several times before being helped, but Newport really surprised me. It was Sunday last week around 12:30 - the busiest time for lunch - high traffic - villages of Chinese people flooding in. Initially, I had a party of 20 - so I went early in comparison to the rest of the church crowd. I told the guy up front that I had 20 people coming, and he asks how long it will be for them to all arrive. Upon asking why - he said there was actually 2 tables freeing up right when I showed up and he could give them to me. So as I was waiting for them to clean up the tables, I get a phone call saying "Andrew - looks like we're down to 12 now". I talk to the guy up front and he says - okay, I get one table instead of two. 蔄s the party starts trickling in, guess what? Those that originally flaked out, are back and are bringing more. Seeing that we're down to one table with ~24 people showing up, I start freaking out. The server attending to our table says - no worries - you see that table over there? Hurry up and seat some of your party there - then you that table is yours. So guess what? We went from two tables to one table to two and some change, all in a matter of 5 minutes. I was waiting to be shown the door, but Newport was all accommodating. Absolutely shocking for a Chinese restaurant ESPECIALLY during high tide. THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW: Come during their lunch: The lunch specials are ridiculously great. They range from 5.95 ~6.95, but all of the dishes are of good portions and excellent quality. Be ready to wait: Although I was seated quickly, this place is highly popular and for good reason. 3. Parking: Although there is a private lot, you're better off looking for street parking on the south side of Las Tunas - since I was heading East, I was lucky to find parking right before the restaurant. 4. The food comes out quick: I believe our table ordered 10 dishes and all of them showed up within 7~10 minutes of our placing the order. We each got a complimentary hot & sour soup, and by the time we were just finishing up with the soup, the orders were making their way to the table. HITLIST: Clams with basil sauce: Clams were cooked to a good texture and consistency. The sauce was not really relevant - could have been black bean sauce for all I cared. It was tasty and I enjoyed it, but no real wow factor. [7.5/10] Fish with basil sauce: The pieces of fish were easy to eat and quite pleasant in general. They were moderately seasoned and tasted very good with rice. [7.5/10] Kung Pao Chicken: Your better than par kung pao chicken, but it didn't really stand out much either. Peanuts were not overpowering and the diced chicken was pretty good. [7/10] French Style Beef: Although this item was not off the lunch special, it was a crowd favorite. Completely stole the show. I believe it was $11.95 - but each piece of meat was tender. Seasoned with black pepper sauce and onions, it was absolutely delicious. Goes well by itself or with rice. Very smart choice. [9.5/10] VERDICT: I am definitely making Newport a Sunday lunch consideration. The prices were good and the quality of food was better than I expected.

OMG! i am a seafood lover, especially lobster and this place by far has the best lobster! They charge by pound for the lobster. Usually for 3-4 people, you get a small lobster which is 4lbs roughly. Cost is in the $60-$70 dollar range. But every bit worth it. Another dish that is a must here is the bo luc lac, when translated is beef cubes. The meat is so tender, it can pass off as kobe beef!!! That's how tender the beef is here. Unlimited refills of white rice. 蔜his is a must if you are in the Los Angeles area. Total dinner for 4 can run you easily over $100. But if you want to treat yourself to one of the best meals you ever had, come here. You wont be disappointed.

We went to their old location, which was in the same plaza as Golden Deli. 蔜here was a big "We've moved" sign on the door. 蔜hey moved a few blocks down the street. 蔔ow the restaurant is in a much bigger space with its own parking lot. 蔜he restaurant used to have a... well, crappy and ghetto interior. 蔅ut at this new location, it became fancy. 蔠e thought they probably raised the price as well, but actually most of the dishes still have the old price. 蔜he new place is much much bigger, but there were still lots of people waiting outside. The five of us ordered a family dinner set with 4 dishes plus 2 more of their specialty dishes. 蔠e LOVE the Beef Loc Lac. 蔜he cubed steak was super tender. 蔍t was sauteed with a black pepper sauce, served over a bed of raw sliced onion and lettuce. 蔛imply delicious. Since my mom doesn't eat spicy food, we ordered everything non-spicy. 蔔ewport Special Lobster was $15.95 per pound that night and we ordered a small 3.75 pounds one. 蔍t was sauteed with ginger, garlic, green onion and their special spices. 蔐ots of meat and it had some eggs, too. 蔒y mom was very happy with it. The rest of the dishes were from the family dinner set. 蔠e got the $28 one with one soup and three dishes. 蔉or the soup, the choices were Cat Fish Hot and Sour Soup or the House Seafood Soup. 蔛ince mom doesn't eat spicy, we got the seafood soup. 蔜he soup had tons of seafood. 蔅ig shrimp, squid, fish balls, pork and vegetable. 蔖retty good soup. 蔍 had two bowls. Kong Pao came with either chicken or beef. 蔛ince we already got a beef dish, we opted for chicken. 蔍t was the first time I had non-spicy Kong Pao. 蔍t was actually quite good. 蔍t had a hint of sweetness to it. For the vegetable dish, the choices were Sauteed Peasprout or Chinese Broccoli. 蔜he Sauteed Peasprout was fresh and very good. The clam with basil leaves were very flavorful. 蔠ell, I think it would taste even better a little spicy. After our satisfying meal, we were treated with some fresh sweet oranges. I really like Newport Seafood. 蔈verything was delicious. 蔜he set was definitely a deal. 蔍f the dishes were ordered separately, it would cost $42. 蔅ut the set was only $28. 蔜he Beef Loc Lac and lobster were the must get items. 蔠e will most definitely be back again.

Before I go on the review, I want to respond to the Bobby N.'s comment. the people that work there speak Chinese, more specifically, Cantonese, not Vietnamese. Also, most of the people that immigrated to Vietnam are Chinese as a result of the war. So, not to take away from your Vietnam pride, but if you look at the type of food served there, it is Southern China (Cantonese) cuisine. You can take credit for your Pho, but stir fry and seafood is a Cantonese specialty. Anyway, on to my review. I came here for a lunch business meeting. We of course had the lobster, which was superb. Perfectly seasoned, a bit salty, but still great tasting. We also had the peppered beef, deep fried mint fish, clams, kung pao chicken, and a few others. All were delicious, not too oily like other Chinese places. I do have to say that the beef was a bit tough and chewy, wouldn't recommend it. Overall, food is fresh and service is great.

Best dishes to get are: Kung Pao Chicken & Fish Filet with Basil for lunch specials. Their lunch specials run through 4:45pm everyday including weekends (except holidays). You just can't beat the deal you're getting. For dinner (or lunch) order the French Style Beef. 4 out of 5 times, it's great. Once in a while, it's a bit too salty. If you don't like salty food, order it with special request for low sodium. These three dishes are tried and true. You won't regret getting these.

The Best Chinese Food (Vietnamese Style) you'll ever eat. I've been here many times, the food here was authentic and it lives up to its hype if you order the following dishes. + Salt & Pepper Squid + Kung Pao Chicken + French Style Steak + House Special Lobster (I believe Minimum was 3-4 lb per order, will feed at least 4 people). The lobster was so delicious. It was dressed with green onions, garlic, and other amazing flavors.There will be a party inside your mouth with each bite. The prices are very reasonable for all their dishes. Everything is around $10 (except for the Lobster). I think the Lobster was approximately $20 / lb. The food here was so good it still taste amazing the next day when I bring the leftovers to work.

Short: If you LOVE lobster, this is the place. Full: Every time I drive pass here with my windows down I drool cause they smell is so intoxicating. I bet the poor patients at the hospital next door can't wait to get out and try this place lol. This place is pricey, but just for the lobster, it's worth it. The house special lobster and normal lobster yee mein are perfectly done. I've never had such good lobster in my life, even the lobster at Chinese weddings can't compare. I'm more of a lobster fan than a crab fan. Both are good here, but the lobster is better just because I'm biased.

The lobster... is so... f*ckin' goooooooooooood... I don't know how to describe it really, except that each bite made me crave more and MORE LOBSTER!!! The flesh is slighty crunchy on the outside (from the deep-frying I suppose), while the inside stays virginal white and begs for you to sink your teeth into it... and when you do, the tender meat gives way to succulent juices squirting into your mouth and ... wow, am I the only one getting slightly turned on by this? If, for some unknown reason, you're not a big lobster fan, try the clams doused in black bean sauce and the black pepper beef. Somehow or other they've turned those beef cubes to such degrees of tenderness that they disintegrate (once again into succulent juices) on your tongue. Then again, why the heck would you want to come here if you're not a big lobster fan...?

I've been eating here for years and they've always been great, both at the old and current location. I don't go as often as I would like because it does tend to get pricey with the house special lobster (and a must-get dish if you come here, otherwise, shame on you!), prices do vary but a lobster of at least 4-5 lbs will stay under $100. The parking is always full, but if you wait it out for a couple of minutes, a car's bound to leave. When I go during peak hours, I would just park at Carl Jr's across the street and walk over. There's always a wait, which can vary from 15 minutes to an hour, but that's to be expected seeing how many people are always lining up to eat. The services is pretty good, they clean your plates out when needed and for most part the staff is generally friendly. They tend to get swamped and sometimes you have to get their attention to get what you want, but it's really no bother at all. I usually just get the lobster with the canh chua (sweet and sour soup) and some rice, but there are a couple of other noteworthy dishes. The clams are nice, I've always tried to order the oysters but they never seem to have it available when I drop by. The shrimp and walnut is really good but it may be a bit too much for some people (its mixed with mayo and whatnot). The bo luc lac (beef) is pretty good as well, but like I mentioned, you HAVE to get the lobster, it's simply amazing. The only problem I have with this place is that I always leave this place with an uncomfortable "I-shouldn't-have-eaten-that-much-because-I'm-too-?damn-full-now" feeling. Satisfaction accompanies said feeling.

Everything here is extremely tasty - but per their reputation, you definitely can't leave without getting the lobster. 蔒ake sure to ask for extra green onions because it makes for extra-tastiness with rice. A good bargain is coming here for their lunch menu. 蔐ike many lunch menus, it's a fraction of the dinner price and just as tasty.

This is GREAT! Okay. A lot of people say they don't take credit cards, but they take credit cards now! Just not AMEX. Make sure you try the lobster. It's just as good as the Boston Lobster I tried. They're HUGE. The waiter asked us what size of lobster do we want, s, m, or L... we asked, how big is the small? The waiter: 4 lbs. We were like O_O We have left over, cuz we order 5 dishes for 3 people. I gave them four because I am a fan, but I think they can do better on the Curry Crab. Also, even though the restaurant is new, the floor is not very clean. However, overall, all the food is fresh, came out pretty fast too. We had (in order of yummy level, in my opinion): House Style Lobster (make sure you order the house style) Seafood Tofu Soup Black Beans Clam Garlic Dao Miu Curry Crab (not marinated well enough in my opinion, or can be more spicy, but the sauce tastes really good with rice)

There's something kind of great about being the only two brown dudes in an Asian restaurant. 蔄lthough we definitely got some "are you lost, the 10 is only a few blocks down" stares from many, we definitely felt like ballers eating here. The service was exactly what it needed to be. 蔠e even ordered before we sat down in order to expedite the process. 蔍 have to mention, though, it was funny being the only ones offered forks. In terms of the food, my favorites were the fried tofu and the French cube beef. 蔆ouple that with some Fischer Beer and you'll be in heaven. ...you'll also pass out for about 45 minutes because of how full you are (and the servers may poke fun at you).

It's kind of like walking out of the drab San Gabriel suburbs and into Hong Kong. The first time we went we ordered a few dishes off the menu and everything was delicious. However, about halfway through our first meal we got the real inside scoop. So, next time we went for the classic order of clams, then lobster (~$60 for the small 4 pounder) with a side of yam leaves, pea sprouts or both. Goes great with "French beer" (as it's listed on teh menu) which is actually sort of a light German-style beer from Alsace. Delicious!

I was driving around with my mom trying to figure out what to eat for lunch. We actually drove past Newport Tan Cang and made a U-turn so we can try this place. There were plenty of parking spaces still available. Once we entered, it was a very pleasant surprise. You couldn't tell this place use to be a Marie Calendar's. The whole restaurant has a "new" modern feeling. You can see the tanks of crabs, fish, lobsters once you enter as well. Unfortunately, we did have to wait a little because they didn't have any small tables for us. My mom and I got seated at a table fitted for four. It was unusually large because we had to talk really loud just to hear each other across the table. The lunch menu consisted of dishes costing from $6.96 - $7.95, which is about the average price of other chinese restaurants. We decided to order three dishes because just ordering two seemed so little for our big table. They gave us a bowl of Sweet and Sour Soup, which was barely lukewarm. We ordered: Shrimp with Cashews - plenty of shrimp, comes with lots of veggies Peking Pork Chop - not what i was expecting at all, lots of sauce and onions. The pork has a bit too much fat though. Squid with Shrimp Paste - I couldn't taste any hint of shrimp. The squid was a little tough. Overall, all the flavors were decent enough. The food was not super oily as well. Our waiter saw we were done with our food and packed everything up for us, including the rice. We didn't even ask for it either. The wait staff here is super attentive and nice. They ended our meal with a plate of oranges. Our lunch was just under $20 + tip. Definitely not a bad thing. AND they take Amex!!! For a chinese place to take that is just so cool to me. I'm definitely going to be coming back...

What's the deal with the lobster love? It's good, but it's not mind-blowing! There are so many other underrated options on the menu like the Frech-style beef, the On Choy, or even the delicious fruit-based smoothies. I'd give it 5 stars except the restroom was a frightful mess the last time I stopped by. It looked like a King Taco patron made a deposit into the wrong receptacle. hint: poo in urinal. Whatever - the clams are great too - especially during lunch hours.

I was craving Chinese food lately and I read about this place on http://LAist.com. I felt like trying a new place so I grabbed my sister and parents and then drove over to San Gabriel Valley. The place was packed and very noisy, but as you walked in the smell of the crabs and lobsters cooking drew you in. We were excited! So was everyone else, because an Asian guy also waiting fainted in anticipation. Just kidding. He did faint....just not about the food. The funny and sad thing about this incidence was his Asian family. Instead of taking him to the hospital or calling for the paramedics, they still waited around for their table!! Even the hostess recommended they call 911 and had the phone ready in her hand, but the family insisted all he needed was water and didn't leave. They even carried him off to their table when their number was called!! I'm Asian myself and I know how crazy we can be sometimes, but I was still appalled while watching the whole situation transpire, but I guess the food was just that good. And it was. We ordered the House Special Dungeness Crab, Sauteed Pea Sprouts, Shrimp Fried Rice, and their French Beef. The crab in their House Special sauce was amazing that my sister and I literally sucked the juice off the shell. The Pea Sprouts, which were recommended by our waiter, was excellent. The French Beef was just average (had a little too much of the sauce than I cared for) , but everything else was amazing. My dad who isn't impressed very easily, said that he would definitely want to come back. Newport Seafood FTW! And I hope the guy who fainted was ok. I may be the only one concerned about him.

Just went here last weekend and beat the crowd! Yeah baby! But considering how quickly they serve you, your wait time won't be that bad unless you have a large party. There were 4 adults and a toddler in our group. The waiter was friendly and already knew what we wanted. We ordered: 1) House special lobster I loved the Lobster, but my wife didn't. She thought it was over salted. I didn't notice it much. I was probably on my 4th piece by the time she was done with her first. Ask the waiter on what size of the lobster you should get if you're unsure. 2) Peppered Beef Very tender and delicious. A must order dish. 3) Catfish (3 style) � very unnessary. Waiter convinced us to get this. Our catfish was made into 3 different dishes - First some of it was for the soup base. Very good with added clams and veges. Next came half of the fish fried in the popular tangy sauce. I didn't care for this one as much. Then the last part was the other half that was boiled. The meat was a little tough and the fish seemed slightly undercooked. Catfish meat should be much softer. I think it was rushed. 4) Chicken Chow Mein We got this for my toddler but she didn't like it at all. You won't be ordering this here unless you have older kids. This place is definitely not for toddlers who are just starting to eat adult food. I guess we'll have to look over the menu a little more carefully next time. I was happy, but my kid left pissed. Overall good stuff. Take CASH. NO CREDIT CARDS. Our bill ran up to $250. It would have been lower if we weren't tricked into ordering that fish.....oh well.

As a huge Chinese food and seafood lover, I was very excited to try this 4.5 stars-over-850+ reviews restaurant. 蔍 am sad to say that this place was a real let down. My initial problems with this place were: -The waiter lied. 蔜hey have a boba menu with various flavored drinks and I asked the waiter if the fruit smoothies were made of real fruit. 蔋e said yes. 蔛o I ordered the papaya one, but when I got it there was not a single trace of real fruit. 蔍'm no stranger when it comes to boba drinks and this is definitely one of the powdered variety. �-The boba milk tea wasn't any better. 蔜he flavor was off and the tea was also another powdered drink. Okay, whatever, maybe the waiter misunderstood me. This isn't boba joint, after all. 蔍 moved on to ordering food... but to my disappointment I found that they do not serve scallops. 蔔ooooo! 蔛callops are my absolute favorite. �I was surprised that a Chinese SEAFOOD restaurant didn't carry scallops. Oh well. 蔜here were plenty of other good looking items on the menu. 蔄t this point I was still eager to try the food at this seemingly legendary restaurant. I decided on the Sizzling Seafood Platter...and to my disappointment again, it was below average. 蔜he seafood resembled the frozen kind you get prepackaged at the supermarket - small shrimp, mini calamari rings, and fish cakes. 蔠tf fish cakes? 蔠hen I order this dish at other restaurants I'd get big juicy shrimp and scallops and some real fish at least. 蔍'd rate it 4/10. My friend ordered the Black Peppered Beef Chow Fun and it was better, but nothing special. 蔍 could get something just as good if not better at your neighborhood Sam Woo. 蔜his one probably gets a 7/10. If I had to sum this review up in three words, they would be: POWDER, FROZEN, LIES. 蔛ounds quite unappealing, I suppose. I don't understand the hype about this place. 蔖erhaps live seafood is their strong suit and some of their other items are just subpar. 蔝nfortunately I came with a friend who is allergic to seafood and I couldn't order a whole crab or lobster to myself. 蔍'm not sure if I'm going to give this place another chance in the future, but if I do I am coming with a group and ordering live seafood family style.

Almost never will I be disappointed with the quality food served at Newport. 蔜o this day, I still rave about the place to anyone who's looking for some authentic Chinese food. The fella and I stopped by here for lunch one Sunday afternoon. 蔍 thought I was slick bringing him here about half an hour after opening, but I was so WRONG. 蔄t 12:15, there was already a line for lunch. 蔠hy?? 蔕h duh, they serve a lunch special! 蔜heir menu consists of various tasty dishes at specific prices (i.e. appro. $5-8), including rice and soup. 蔛ince the fella has never been here (nor had any Chiu Chow style dishes), I suggested that we order the Beef Satay Fried Noodle, Salt & Pepper Crab, & the Cashew Shrimp. �The fried noodle was delicious as always! 蔄 light flavorful satay undertoned sauce, stir fried with beef and Chinese broccoli, layed on a bed of fresh deep fried noodles. 蔄dd a bit of chili sauce (Sriracha) and you'll love the flavorful explosion with each crunchy bite! 蔜he fella really seemed to enjoy the salt and pepper crab. 蔒oist crab meat on the inside and a spicy, salty batter masked the shells of the crab. 蔕ne tip that I like to share is that whoever gets the shell of the crab, scoop some hot rice and mix it in with the crab egg. 蔍t's absolutely delicious! The only grip that I have about coming to Newport is the parking. 蔜he lot is fairly limited in parking spaces. 蔣our best bet is to find street parking. 蔍 always tend to park a street or two away and just walk over. 蔜rust me, you'll be glad to walk a bit once you're done dining here! Bon appetite!

The French-style Beef Loc Lac was pretty good. For everything else we had that day, I would think you can find a decent replacement in any of the Cantonese restaurants around the Alhambra and Monterey Park area. Overall, this is a good but not spectacular Chinese seafood restaurant.

Me: "How long is the wait?" Restaurant: "30 minutes" Me: "Okay, that's fine" Restaurant: "You're number 30 please" ...waits 30 minutes... Restaurant: NUM-BAH DIRTY.... NUM-BAAAH THIRTY Me: Wait what? Well besides the standing around and hunting around for a spot to eat, I don't advise anyone coming in between 6-7:30 since it's usually an hour wait... If you do, good luck on parking. If you're the owner start a valet service please... I paid $70 with food, taxes, and tip included for a party of four and we were stuffed. We ordered the food set that was around $40 with two additional dishes and it was plenty. Portions were huge, food had a nice flavor to it and service was snappy.

Well done, well done. Went there today for lunch with a friend and had a fantastic experience. Fortunately, we arrived right before opening time so parking was a breeze. However, when we finished, the parking lot was boiling with the ferocity of a thousand angry asian drivers. So, either get their early or at off-times, or be ready to battle for each parking spot. When we walked in, we were promptly seated at a booth by the windows. The place is beautifully decorated and clean. It has many massive tables perfect for large groups. Having yelped the place, we ordered the following: 1) Clams with Black Bean Sauce 2) Shrimp and Cashews 3) Sauteed Peasprout The dishes arrived extremely quickly, along with the free tea, free rice, and free individual bowls of hot and sour soup. We loved the clams and the shrimp. Both well-cooked and extremely flavorful. No sand in the clams, and the textures of both were delectable. However, I have never been very fond of peasprouts, and today was no different (not the restaurants fault). I find it hard to swallow to begin with, and the more I chew it, the more dry it becomes, making it increasingly difficult to stomach. And so, round and round we go on the spiral of peasprouty doom. Throughout the meal, the server checked on us constantly, making sure we never ran out of tea or rice = ten points for Tan Cang. After we had finished, we were brought a complimentary plate of some of the juiciest oranges I have ever tasted. A wonderfully fresh way to end the meal. The prices are very reasonable, the food delicious, the servers attentive, and the ambience great. I'll be back.

I read all the outstanding reviews and forced my husband to trek to San Gabriel for the lobster. 蔜he 3 1/2 LB lobster @ $15.95 per pound was mostly shell. 蔠e could find very little of the precious tail meat and the claws were almost empty. 蔠e probably got about a pound of meat from the whole lobster. 蔋owever, there was probably a pound of green onions on top to make up for the lack of meat. �I have no problem eating at a place with a B rating from the health dept. but there wasn't even a rating posted... I'll update you if either of us get sick. 蔍 probably won't, as my gut 蔵s made of iron, my husband on the other hand is a food snob and is sick just from the thought of wasting $90 (4 beers and a noodle dish included) on such mediocre fare.

i fell in love with this place the first time i went & i remember like it was yesterday... so this is how it all started....a very good buddy of mine aka sperm eyes told my brother & i about this amazing lobster, seafood joint. she said this place is usually be packed and there would be a long line out side & they take no reservations for nobody!! and i don't like waiting in lines anywhere i go...so i called the restaurant and asked for the owner and i told her who i was and told her that i will be arriving in about 15 mins and she said she will have a table ready for me asap!! after i hang up the phone my friend didn't believe me at all. she said she has been going there for over 15+ years and they never took reservations for anybody. so we arrive at the location and 蔮oy my buddy wasn't lying about the long line..i told her just follow me and watch what i do!! right when i enter in the restaurant the smell of the food was so good and the place was a full house! so i go straight to the counter and asked for the owner~ the lady greeted me and asked if i was one that called from the D! and you all ready know we get love wherever we go! so as she was walking us to the table, we were having a nice conversation about detroit lol anyways lets talk about the food...my buddy did the ordering since she knows whats good...we ordered 8lb of newport special lobster, shrimp with salt & pepper and clam with black bean sauce. by being so busy i didn't expect the food to come out that fast therefor i was very pleased with the warm hospitality and the quick service!! i would of care less if the food tasted terrible~ but the food tasted amazing!!! 蔵 thought i was in the heaven when that juicy lobster that was seasoned to perfection melted in my mouth. i literally enjoyed every single bite till the end. this place will always be #1 in my heart. they have shown me prompt, professional, friendly and courteous service. also maintained a clean and comfortable atmosphere. their product with highest standards of quality, freshness and seasonality and combines both modern-creative and traditional asian seafood styles of cooking.

It's got so many wonderful reviews already and yet I had to chime in cause I just love this place! �This is one of a few places that I'm willing to take on the LA traffic and drive 40 minutes to. 蔜he place is very casual but the service is always extremely attentive and great! 蔠e get constant dish changes so that our plates don't pile up with crab or lobster exoskeletons or fish bones. My favorites are the lobster cooked house style (every table in the restaurant orders one), the french beef (very tender and well seasoned and don't forget the lettuce it's on!), the clams, the geoduct (elephant clam) cooked two ways - stir fried with garlic/basil/spicy sauce and soup, water spinach (aka ong choy) stir fry, and any of their fresh fish. 蔒y friends and I rarely eat much rice cause we just want to taste as much of all the food as possible. 蔍 do agree with other reviewers that the sauces are not to be spared! �-) Last but not least, this menu will definitely set you back. 蔠e usually spend between $50-100 per person. 蔄nd it's CASH ONLY.

Best Chinese Vietnamese Lobster - Hands down!! Lobster texture is not rubbery, easy to pull off the flesh, and the meat are PLENTIFUL! It's bathed in a special butter, green onion and jalapeno with a touch of maggie sauce! I can die and go to heaven with this kind of Lobster =) The French beef is really great too! Everything is affordable except the lobster $16/ pound but it's still a great deal for the price! Recommended to eat from 'Wendy' before you die! PS: French style beef, Peking Pork Chop, Thai Beef Stew, Chinese Broccoli (sauteed in Garlic NOT steamed in oyster sauce), Kung Pao Chicken, Salt N' Pepper Shrimp, Pepper Filet and of course the Lobster (the signature dish), fried batter tofu , House Special Lobster,

Everyone knows this places is truly amazing. What makes my review different is that I do not eat shellfish, and I can attest to you that the rest of the food (beef, chicken, fish, veggie dishes) are all amazing! You have to try the filet mignon dishes. It's like their version of a vietnamese/french style dish. I cannot believe the amazing price for the quality and for the amount they serve. All the other dishes are great as well (chicken curry is amazing. I have never ever liked kung pao chicken before, but holy cow it is amazing here!!). Boba flavors are great as well. If you want to drink a fresh coconut, you might as well get one because they are so inexpensive and fresh. The prices are phenomenal here. Lunch prices are ridiculously amazing, but realistically the prices are so darn good, that it might even be a better deal for dinner. AND you get a lot of food. Not sure how they do it all and all this with excellent staff too! They are very helpful in suggesting things you may like based on what you are interested in having. They have never suggesting anything that wasn't great! Finally, this is a nice restaurant and what is great is you can feel comfortable coming in jeans or shorts or wearing a suit. It is really a great place!

I really want to like this place like a lot of people do but I'm only willing to give it a 3. I guess I can't use an hour wait as an excuse but it was a little bit of a turn off to wait an hour for this place. I wouldn't say that was the reason why I'm giving this place a 3 stars though I would say the fact that when we finally got seated the waiters asked us if we are ready to order and we said no. A min later another waiter asked us are we ready to order and we said no again... and then another minute later we get asked again if we are ready to order. Yea... No...that is just horrible service if we are asked if we are ready to order in matter of 2 mins span not to mention we were asked by the same person in a matter of a minute. Back to the food, we ordered 5 dishes for 7 people to share which was the house-style lobster, french beef, clams, cabbage wraps, and veggie dish. Honestly the hype for the lobster and french 蔮eef was totally there because they were both really flavorful. I really love the sauce that came with the lobster which you can eat with rice all day long. The lobster was really fresh and I liked it a lot. The french beef was simply delicious...It was really tender and the raw onions that went with it was delish as well. mmmm. Honestly the real reason why my final review is a 3 is because the clams, veggie, and the cabbage wrap was simply whatever or just not good at all. I mean i know they are basically famous for their 2 dish but we can't just order 2 dishes and be full for a party of 7. -_- If their other dishes were as delicious as their lobster and french beef then i would probably give it a 4...but not to mention their service and wait is not enjoyable. OH and the price is slightly more to the expensive side but I dont mind the pricing as much as their service and the service.

Not much more I can add to the already great reviews. I grew up with this kind of food and newport seafood does it right! Living on the westside now I never get to eat such good seafood... and the price can't be beat. Word of advice. Get there early. By 6pm on a weekend there is already a line. Service is crazy fast as is are all the SGV places so the time from ordering to actually eating is less than 10minutes.

wow where do i start? �i had been moaning and groaning about how i was craving crab since last week and the bf promised he'd take me to get some this past weekend. he delivered. i picked a good one. we ordered the newport special crab, the house special whole trout, and the filet mignon cubes. ho-ly sh-ie-t. when the crab first came out, i lovingly speared a chunk with my chopstick and took a very un-ladylike bite. the flavors were SO intense my head started spinning. in all honesty, the crab was INSANELY good when it was served pipping hot but once it cooled lost a (tiny) bit of the insanely good-ness. but it was still my favorite dish of the night. i annihilated it. the house special whole trout was pretty good but only after a few bites. 蕎hen it first came out, i reeled back because of the smell of the sauce it was smothered in was a little too pungent for my taste. it kinda grew on me when i ate it with the rice but i found myself feeling kinda queasy after a few bites. the bf said the same thing. 蔴e finished most of it with his rice. the beef cubes were delicious. melt in your mouth tender and the peppery seasoning definitely fit the bill. 蔵 wrapped it korean style in the lettuce leaves w/ the tomato and raw onions. delish! as great as the dishes were, i find myself still feeling kinda queasy from last night's meal. i dunno if it was the actual dishes or the fact that me and my bf killed all three plates (that probably serves 6 people) by ourselves. a must try if you're in the area!

Our friends took us out to dinner last night and they picked Newport because they were craving lobster. I've been to the old location just a mile away, but never at the new location, looks like an old Marie Callendar's from the outside, but inside was nicely decorated, kind of a modern Asian decor, very nice. There's only 4 of us, but we decided to go all out and order everything we wanted, here goes: Medium House Lobster: Awesome! You need to order this dish. Small Sweet & Sour Deep Fried Fish: Very flavorful, fish was fresh. Clams w/basil: Clams were nice and plump, delicious. Bo Luc Lac: Beef was very tender, a little too peppery but still good. Fried Tofu: Simple, yet very delicious, must order. Sauteed Peasprouts: It was OK, Ong Choy would have been a better choice. Needless to say, the 4 of us couldn't finish everything, but the leftovers will make a nice lunch next day. Service was good, they bring you new plates every 15 minutes knowing your old plates will be full of lobster and clam shells. As for the bill, I didn't get a chance to even look at it cause our friend grabbed it too fast, I'm sure it was close to $200. This is not a meal you can have everyday, but once every 2-3 months it's a real nice treat. The seafood is fresh and even with a long line, it's well worth the wait.

I came here on Mother's Day over the weekend, and it was a good choice. Great special occasion place for large parties, but make sure to arrive early for dinner because the wait is extremely long and they have a no reservations policy. 蔜hey sat us in the large group booth area and the decor in that section was really cute & trendy. 蔜he service was very good, and the food was delicious. Of course you have to get the lobster special. I also really liked the fried tofu & basil clam dishes. 蔜he beef loc lac was okay. 蔜he house special steamed fish was good too. 蔜he only complaint that I had was that the all the dishes were seasoned with way too much MSG. 蔣eah I know, MSG in Chinese food... big surprise there.

Best Chinese food in town. They took over the Marie's Calendar lot so the restaurant can hold a lot more people, have several private rooms, and the parking lot is more spacious. I dine here or take out is never a disappointment. I usually come for the house special lobster, the clams with basil leaves (yummy) , salt & pepper shrimps or crabs, the fried tofu, and the beef cut in small cubes is perfect to your taste. The boba drinks is fun to drink, dont let those boba fill you up.

My husband had never been a big fan of lobsters, until he found this place last year (he lived in Boston for four years, come on). We went there with my family and friends, and we all loved it. Every table has a New Port lobster. They always ask you if you are ok with spicy food. Never mind. Their "spicy" will not heat up your tongue and it is better with their "spicy". Trust me! Their drinks are a little too sweet for me though. So if you didn't grow up eating American desserts, you need to ask them to put less sugar in it.

The new Newport is beayoootiful! It has a main dining room and a bunch of little rooms for bigger tables. We got reservations for a big table in one of those rooms and it was great. It's not an actual room; it's sectioned off with open woodwork that makes it feel like your own space but it still sounds like a restaurant instead of deathly "we're in our own room" kind of quiet. I highly recommend them if it's some occasion or if you have small children. This time around, the lobster and crab stuck to the shells and the loc lac beef was more steamed than flash fried. It's like we got all our food cooked in a cold wok. But the food wasn't as salty as it usually is. But those are just small complaints because we ate pretty much everything. Two lobsters, kung pow chicken, fried fish, gai lan, tung choi, 蕄ork, loc lac beef, soup, crab, mussels... I can't remember the rest but it was a TON of food! The price has definitely gone up due to the new digs and the economy but still very worth it.

This place is awesome. I went to the Santa Ana location a few years ago and was impressed, and feeling nostalgic, decided to have my birthday dinner here earlier this year. I never went inside the old location, which is funny because it was right next to one of my favorite pho places, Golden Deli. Go fig. Anyway, the new location is gorgeous. You can tell it used to be a Marie Callender's back in the day from the outside architecture. Inside, it's pretty swanky and almost too hoity toity with the whole white linen action going on... but stay focused! We're here for the food, people. And oh, is that food good! The gingery, garlicky lobster I had a few moons ago in ghetto fashion on sticky formica tables at their Santa Ana location was beautifully reproduced in grand style. We ordered way too much food, and it was totally my fault because I was going overboard for my birthday. We also got calamari, kangkong, steamed fish, bo luc lac, chow mein... my memory's getting fuzzy probably because of the food coma that was induced after all that food. :p The service was excellent. Our waiters were extremely attentive and gave us suggestions on what we definitely should order. They even spoke some Tagalog with us for fun. Extremely clean facility-- food was served quickly, and empty plates were whisked away without a problem. Now to the price... it's lobster. If you expect to come in here and pay $15/person, you're sorely mistaken. 3 of us came here and we paid about $150 before tip, but that was with a few takeout boxes worth of leftovers, so you do the math. Don't worry about your attire, they're pretty laid back here. After all, you will get crustacean all over yourself and you don't want to mess up your nice duds, right? Just come here, relax, have fun and some good eats! Isn't that what Yelp's all about? :)

Believe the hype! This is it! The best seafood you can get around the area. Food: Perhaps the best salt and pepper prawns I've ever had. Their signature lobster was excellent but I can't tell if it's the best I've ever had since I don't really eat too much lobster. The clams were delish. I don't normally eat clams but this made it an exception! I hear the beef cubes are really good too but I didn't order it I'll be sure to do so next time. Service: Not the best service ever. Adequent for the restaurant I guess. Definitely can use improvement though. Environment: This is their "new" location. Everything feels new! Pretty classy feel to it. Price: I guess its not that expensive considering its seafood. Definitely worth it! Food: 5 Service: 4 Environment: 5 Price: 4

I LOVE their steamed, cooked baby pea sprouts and clams in black bean sauce! 蔒y family always order this to-go. In their old location, you could NEVER find parking so I'm very glad they got their own space. 蔕nly thing is, there isn't enough parking either! 蔍t's just way too popular, but at least there's a wider space to turn around. Just always be careful of sand in your clams. 蔜hey do the best they can to wash the clams, but they aren't completely perfect.

Wow I haven't been back here since I was in high school. I was looking around on Yelp the other day trying to find a place for dinner on NYE, and seeing Newport made me reminisce about how awesome the lobster here was. I decided to treat my family to dinner here tonight as an excuse to go again, so we made the drive over from DB. We arrived a little after 7pm, and as expected, there was a pretty big line already. Fortunately, since there were just three of us, we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes. Unfortunately though, our food took about half an hour to come out, with one of the larger tables seated after us getting their food first: the reason we were given was that their lobster was prepared spicier, and they didn't want to mess up the orders (what?). In any case, our order of garlic and green onion lobster, French style beef, and garlic snow pea shoots eventually came. My mom and sister found all the dishes to be overly salty since they're light (in terms of seasoning) eaters, while I found it to be teetering between okay and too salty - eaten with plenty of rice though, the flavors balanced out well. The lobster was still as amazing as I remembered, and the French beef was pretty good too, juicy, tender, and flavorful. As for the snow pea shoots, well, it's hard to make something like that wrong. All in all, the dishes still taste as great as they did years back, but the prices have definitely gone up a lot since then. While not really a surprise, my mom was saying how we'd usually get another three or four dishes (a chicken, clam, and a pork dish) and still end up paying about the same $100 we did tonight, so I find it hard to attribute that all to inflation alone. Still, it's worth coming to at least once for the lobster. Just keep in mind that for large parties there'll probably be a long wait, and with all the lobsters being around four pounds, each order will set you back roughly $60.

I'm typically skeptical of Chinese food as most of the Chinese food I've eaten has been overly salted and greasy, and every dish seems to taste the same. 蔅ut Newport Seafood serves surprisingly tasty dishes. 蔜hey have a big menu with a wide variety of flavors. 蔜he sizzling fish plate wasdelicious, slightly sweet, mild, and super tender. 蔜he monochromatic look of the dish could be improved by adding vegetables with more color (everything on the plate was light beige colored). 蔜he shrimp chow fun was served in huge portions, but unfortunately the taste was not a big as the plate. 蔍t was rather bland. 蔜he basil clams were delicious, but about 25% of them contained grit/sand. Service was noticeably fast and efficient and I appreciated that the tables were large with ample space between tables. It's best to eat there at off hours (dinner at 4:30pm) to avoid the crowds and long waits. 蔍'm looking forward to going back and trying some new dishes, especially the king crab. 蔍t's also probably better to go with a big group so that you can try as many different dishes as possible.

I think this is the best Chinese "restaurant" in SoCal. Granted there are many types of Chinese cuisines, but I think the food here is amazing. Best way to enjoy this place is to not eat anything for the whole day and come during rush hour so you can wait an hour for your table. This will give your nose the opportunity to take in the wonderful smells and your mouth to start involuntary drooling. Once you have finally been seated after scaring off current customers with your piercing stares and drooling, I recommend getting one of the set menus. They pretty much cover what Newport is known for AND that stuff comes out really quickly if you do. They must run things like a mass production assembly line in the kitchen... Finally, try and ignore those creeps staring and waiting for you to finish your food. They deserve to wait for coming during rush hour and not eating during the day. Who told them to do that!? Losers.

Their tilapia was steamed just right. 蔕ften this fish is overcooked by many restaurants, but they did a good job here. 蔄lso, the kung pao chicken is stir fried quite well and with consistency. I've tried their family combo and it's well worth it's price. �If you want a blend of Chinese and Vietnamese style food, this is the place to go to.

Decided to have family dinner here on Mother's Day and boy was that one hell of a wait. We got there at about 6pm or so and didn't get seated until nearly 8pm. The wait was very well worth it though. They do have their own private lot with security guard for parking but it isn't that big of a lot to begin with. On a busy day, it will be difficult to find a parking spot and you'll probably see a few dozen close accidents because people don't know how to drive. Much much easier to find street parking. This place is a little bit bigger than their old location. They have private dining areas on one side when you walk in and the public area on the other side and back. The decor is modern Asian and the place is nice and clean. The service here is excellent. They all speak a variety of different languages ranging from Vietnamese, Chinese, to English (there was even a Hispanic waiter running around who helped us throughout the night). They are very attentive and if you need anything, they are quick to get whatever it is you need from plates to more drinks to more food. There are plenty of waiters walking around, clearing plates that are finished on the lazy Susan to clearing out plates and giving you new ones so you have room to eat. They have many items to choose from with their most popular dishes listed at the top with a photo. The waiter knew what he was doing and suggested a few dishes to us, even cutting down on orders because he felt it was too much for the eight of us (he was right). I don't eat seafood so I don't have any opinions on them but my family members sure did enjoy them. Braided Crab Meat and Fish Maw Soup was the soup choice. 3/4 of this was finish and the rest was taken to go. We had the Newport Special Lobster. This 6lb lobster was huge when they bought the dish out. For six people eating it, they couldn't finish it and had to take it to go. Crab Baked with Salt and Pepper... the crab was huge for this dish. Too bad I won't eat it so I can't tell you what it was like. Oysters in Black Bean Sauce was one of the first dishes to be cleaned. The Beef Mongolian dish was delicious. It tasted like a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, ginger, pepper and something else. This was mixed with green onions. Very flavorful. Recommended. Yang Chow Fried Rice is often a dish we usually order when going to these types of restaurants. This dish was enjoyed so much that we had to order a second one. Kong Pao Chicken was good. Compared to Chinese fast food places, this dish was not oily at all. The chicken was moist and tender, accompanied by plenty of vegetables. The only thing that was missing was the spiciness to the dish. Beef Chow Fun with Gravy here is different compared to Kim Tar (my favorite spot for this, so far). They use bok choy as their choice of vegetable instead of Chinese broccoli. I believe the dry one is better for this dish. They have plenty of choices for alcohol, smoothies, teas, etc. Overall, awesome choice for a family style dinner. If you haven't been here, take a group of friends or your family! You won't regret it!!

We had the Lobster with Ginger and Green Onion. 蔜hey cut it up nicely so it is easy to get at the meat. 蔜he meat was tasty. 蔍n retrospect, I think I would not have eaten the kong pao chicken before the lobster because the lobster was a little more subtle than all the spicyness and sweetness of the chicken. �The soup had lots of squid and shrimp. 蔜he broccoli was good. 蔍 love the heavy garlic use. �The service was good. 蔊et there early because like everyone says, it gets crowded fast.

I was visiting from Houston and read all the yelp reviews and decided to drive from Ontario, CA to try this restaurant. 蔜his is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever eaten. 蔍've traveled extensively around the US and this is as good as it gets when it comes to seafood. I was by myself and order 3 dishes and people looked at me as though I was in a Man vs. Food episode. �The clams in basil sauce was sublime. The sauce was outstanding and you could throw the sauce on some biscuits to have your Chinese version of biscuits and gravy. The clams were fresh, juicy and plumb. �The shrimp in garlic sauce was also very good. 蔜he flavorful shrimp was paired with a spicy sauce. �The standout was the 2 1/2 lbs of crab in their special sauce. 蔜he dish is very similar to the Vietnamese salt and pepper crab dish. 蔜his sauce was not too salty or sweet. 蔍t was perfect and allow the crab to stand on its own. �This is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in the US. �It was as memorable as eating at R&G Lounge in San Francisco. Update: I came here again and ordered the clams with basil sauce and the fried fish with the kung pao sauce. 蔜he latter item is listed as being serve with the basil sauce but since I got the clams with basil, the waiter suggested the kung pao sauce. �Again, this has to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in the US. 蔜he clams were plump, juicy and perfectly coooked. The fish came as fish strips, that were perfectly fried covered with the most exquistive kung pao sauce. 蔜his is truly a gem and I've told all my friends and family to try to visit this restaurant if they are in LA.

First time I visited Newport Seafood was when they were in their old location (same plaza as Golden Deli). 蔉or those that don't know...parking is a major PITA here. �People raved about their lobster...but at the time, I wasn't really feeling their decor. 蔇idn't think it was good and definitely did not live up to the hype. Fast forward a few years. 蔉riend mentioned that they moved and decided to go back and try again. This time around we waited a good hour for our table. 蔉unny thing is that I don't remember the old location being this busy. 蔠e were finally seated and ordered a lobster (I forget how big) but this time around boy was it good. 蔠e also ordered the bo loc lac. 蔞ery tender and flavorful. 蔕f course we also had to have some ruffge so we ordered the sauteed peasprout. �Definitely have changed my opinion on the food here. 蔈verything was good and have even been back a few times since. 蔇efinitely worth the wait.

Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant is simply the BEST chinese food to me so far. 蔒y favorite dishes are: 1. House Vietnamese Fish soup is like a taste of heaven especially in this rather cold weather 2. French style beef cube/fillet mignon is so yummy and just to die for. stir fried with some awesome sauce, sitting on top of lettuce, onions and tomatoes. It came with a side of lime juice/sauce which was superb. For an extra kick, eat the beef with some onion. Flavor explosion! 3. Clams with mint and basil sauce just fresh and melt in my mouth 4. Fried shrimp with pepper and salt just so crunchy and tasty. It came with a side of lime juice/sauce which was superb. 5. Whole Fried fish with awesome vinegar sauce just keep me eating more, it's the magic sauce 6. Sauteed PeaSprout are just super crunchy and fresh 7. House Special Crabs/Lobsters are juicy and delicious 8. Chinese Broccoli with Squid is good while it's hot 9. Fried Tofu is just special and awesome They also have appetizers, desserts, wine and boba/ice drinks. This place is huge and has so many varieties, so it's a great place to take many people there, so they can find their most suitable asian foods with very reasonable price. Lunch special items are all under $7 per dish. The customer service is super good as they have over 10 waiters/waitresses. However, they are usually super busy during regular lunch/dinner hours, especially on the weekends/major holidays, so sometimes it could be a big mess. 蔈xpect to wait in line for seating during regular lunch/dinner hours. 蔠aiting time is usually 15-30 minutes, sometimes up to over one hour. Their regular hours are from 11.30AM to 9.30PM every day, except on the weekends they close at 10PM. They have so much to choose from on the menu which could always take forever deciding on what you want. 蔛o go with what you are craving for at that time or your guts feelings. The only thing is parking here can be a little difficult. The parking lot isn't that big so many times you have to park on the street, especially on the weekends or during regular lunch/dinner hours. They also have different locations such as in Rowland Height and Westminster. You can just dress casually and take your guy/girl friends there. 蔜he atmosphere is pretty casual, and it's not a romantic dining place though. Overall, it's a great food with good size portion and very reasonable price. So it won't break your wallet. Say hello to the waiters when you go there, they love to be greeted and treated with respect, that way their services for you will be much better than others. Sometimes you can call ahead and you can get a number to save your spot in line during lunch/dinner hours, especially on the weekends/holidays. Or if you prefer just standing in there packed like sardines hehehe ... ;-p It also has better ambience than most Asian Restaurants and very clean. It's pretty inside and nicely decorated, had an A rating (which you know is rare for Asian restaurants in this area), and had amazing food for a great lunch price. The foods were all SUPER yummyyy. You can't go wrong with ANY dish... really, you must try and you will not regret it! 蔛o if you love yourself, make a visit to newport!! :)

I heard about this restaurant back when I was in HS. 蔕ne of my classmate's family owns this place. 蔍 told my parents about this restaurant and mainly because I know my classmate's family come from similar Asian roots... so my parents were thrilled to try this place out. 蔒y parents ended up telling my relatives about it too. 蔜hey were not disappointed at all. 蔍n fact, this is one of my family's favorite restaurant to eat at when they feel like eating their own home cooked meals but not in the mood for cooking haha. 蔄nd makes for a great place for occassions, was just here this past weekend for Grandma's Bday. 蔄nd the owners are so sweet. 蔒y mom got to look at my old classmate's wedding book while waiting for our table of 14. �They used to be located in the same plaza as Golden Deli. 蔄nd let me tell you this, if you think the parking here at this current location sucks, their old location was worse. 蔍magine sharing a very tiny lot with several other businesses, including Golden Deli. �Their current location is really nice. 蔍t used to be Marie Calenders. 蔜hey use nice dark woods for their interior, but not too dark with great lighting schemes. 蔜hey use nice red shades and the space is just so welcoming... For bigger parties, there's divided spaces separating each table, but don't worry, it doesn't feel too enclosed. 蔜here's cutouts in the walls, which incorporates Asian influenced design patterns. Coming from a mixed Asian background and having been fortunate enough to have a dad that cooks like a pro...this place is comparable. 蔛ome of their dishes, like the cat fish in hot and sour soup comes close. 蔒y favorite veggie - the broccoli, with oyster sauce is always cooked perfectly. 蔄nd thee favorite dish of mines is their peking pork chop (I think, I normally don't order the food), it looks like its been honey glazed - color reminds me of Orange Chicken, but slightly darker. 蔜here's a very slight crisp to it, sweet, a bit tangy but definitely bone sucking good!!! ;P

I found this place when I realized ABC Seafood down the street had been closed - they too have the "House Special Newport Crab (or Lobster)" that I used to get at ABC - and it's really good, really good. I mean really good. 蔇efinitely not healthy, but really good. The restaurant itself is actually pretty impressive, I'm not a fan of chinese places in Alhambra/San Gabriel, but I'll admit this was nice. Unfortunately though, that means you got about 1000 people waiting for a table, making it almost not worth the wait to have to listen to the inane conversations I hear while I'm waiting for pickup. I'd probably go crazy actually having to wait there for a table. Parking is usually an issue. I guess it's a new location because when I ordered pickup, last night, she wanted to make sure I was at the right spot - also the picture here on yelp of the front is not the actual new place. Did I mention the house special newport crab is really good? Seriously, try it.

Delicious Lobster- House Style. We all rolled in gangsta-style about 13 of us total including: my parents, my bf, and a few of my studio "big bros". Now, they can eat!!

The lobster has it's unique house flavor that is soooo unique and Oh So Yummy. Everyone should come at least once. 蔍f you can bear the wait, the food will not disappoint. We opted for the family type pre-set meals on the back of the menu... (I dunno, maybe because I was the youngest one there, tbut hey didn't pass me the menu) and while the Luc Lac and clams did not disappoint... THE LOBSTER SHINES. I ALMOST missed the eggies! Lobster roe (teeny blobs of red) is generously sprinkled thoughout the onions and flavored to perfection! Eat this with rice and you'll be groaning with pleasure. Oh, and the restaurant is nice too... lotsa modern communist red, and huge king crabs at the entryway... Like I told my bf, we should save up just to come HERE more often! mmmmmmm.

Food worth the work... I've ate here a few times and each time I havent been disappointed. 蔄s everyone has mentioned, the big wow of this restaurant is their lobster with their house seasoning. 蔜he lobster is moist, flavorful and just one of those dishes that you dont mind cracking all the shells for to get every piece of delicious meat that you can. 蔛easoning is just out of this world. 蔣ou get this nice sweet boom boom pow in your mouth. Service was excellent. 蔕ur server was personable and gave great recommendations on dishes to order. 蔋e even recommended that we order less because there would be too much food. 蔄ny wait that tries to save you money is a good waiter in my book. Originally, going to this restaurant was definitely a pain at the old location just because of the horrendous parking and the fact that they only accepted cash. 蔋owever, since they moved to the new location...all that has changed. 蔜hey accept credit card and even though the parking lot is small there's a good amount of street parking. As with any type of good food comes a stiff price. 蔜he prices here are a little on the expensive side compared to other asian seafood restaurants but I think the quality more than makes up for the price. 蔣ou get what you pay for in my opinion.

You will almost always have to park on the street behind the restaurant because the lot is full. 蔣ou will almost always have to wait for a table. 蔣ou will pay more than at many other Chinese restaurants. 蔅ut it will be worth it. 蔜his is a rare gem even among the countless excellent neighboring Chinese restaurants in San Gabriel: artfully decorated, [relatively] clean, good service and, best of all, phenomenal food. 蔜he lobster is what they're most famous for, and it's bursting with freshness and flavor. 蔅ut if they're sold out, don't worry, there are plenty of other great choices: their black pepper steak is terrific - not over sauced or undercooked like many other places - and comes with salt and a wedge of lime. 蔜he walnut shrimp is basically as flawless as I've ever had, with just the right amount of crispiness and honey sauce, whereas most places do it either too sweet or with not enough mayonnaise to balance out the large, clumsy amounts of fried batter. 蔄nd the Thai soup is rich, pungent and crammed with seafood (calamari, clams, fish and shrimp).

Are you f***ing kidding me? 蔜he parking sucks... period. 蔜hen I looked over at the restaurant and asked my friends why in the hell we were going to this place when we were in the heart of Chinese seafood restaurants. 蔖lus, if I'm eating seafood, do I really want to go to a place that looks like I'd need a tetanus shot before going in? 蔣es, I realize that I was being a huge hypocrite in judging the place by the way it looked (I dig hole in the wall joints and don't get stressed out by hair in my food - as long as it's from the top of their head, cockroaches on the floor as long as they are on the floor and not in the food, etc.) but the lack of parking was frustrating and having a friend's girl in the backseat trying to direct me to nonexistent parking wasn't helping the situation. So upon entering, I quickly realized that lobster was a fairly popular dish... it was on every table. 蔕rder about 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of lobster per person, get some salty spicy shrimp (strangely I liked this dish that was more like a salty shrimp chip... than a semi-moist/firm shrimp that I would expect) and this beef dish (first one on the beef section on the menu and it seemed to have a vietnamese name) that was slightly sweet but good. 蔜hey have beer, weird tiny screw-top mini bottles of wine (backseat driver girl was drinking this) and no champagne (I know that this last one might sound strange but a guy at the table next to us was asking for champagne... this asian guy who was wearing an ascot... interesting). 蔒y recommendation - get beer, lots of it. 蔄s we left, the small place was packed and there were a lot of people waiting out in the rain for a table. 蔍mpressive. FYI - parking sucks so be patient and this joint is cash only so come prepared. 蔛ervice is friendly, attentive and a team effort. 蔄nd they speak English.

Nice seafood restaurant out in the SGV. 蔜hey're known for their lobster and, from first hand experience, it's easy to see why. 蔄lthough my lobster was overcooked (which was disappointing to say the least), it was very flavorful (think garlic and lots of it) and there was plenty of meat to go around. 蔜heir geoduck is also excellent. As some of these other reviews have pointed out, MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH! 蔜hey do not take credit cards. 蔜his is a pretty big drawback in my opinion because this restaurant isn't exactly cheap. With regard to the service, I must say that it was exceptional. 蔜he staff was friendly and, unlike most Chinese restaurants, was not in a hurry to get us out of there. �4 stars for Newport Seafood.

OVER-RATED! My Order: Clams Garlic Shrimp Filet Mignon Salt & Pepper Baked Crab Shrimp Fried Rice Typical Chinese Food...the worst part about my whole meal is when I took my leftovers home and realized that they kept my whole $30+ crab....I was so pissed off...."this happened before, you are not the first" states the girl who answered the phone. I'm not smiling -- I was excited about going there with my roomie because I heard so much great things about it. Very dissapointed -- my rommie is like I can make all this food at home and it will be better. I will never spend money here again. After b*tching for sometime...they offered me a free crab on my next visit -- b*tch please! After griping, I suggested they bring it to me...I live a few blocks. I'm still waiting....I hope no one orders the baked crab and spicy salt...you might be getting my stolen leftovers.....I also forgot to mention you should not order the clams, they will be more than half empty shells. UPDATE: They brought me my crab...and the guy apologized. I still will not go back.

Damn.... I mean damn that was good lobster. Tastes so good when I don't have to pay for it, good thing mom and pop were picking up the tab. �80 for I think 5 lbs of lobster? 蔍'd say it was worth it considering the quality of the lobster and the preparation was very good, like a typical cantonese style lobster but I seriously think Newport does it the best in SGV. 蔜he garlic, scallion, onion, lobster roe condiment which is stir fried with the lobster is so very good that I was using it as a topping for my rice. If lobster is too rich for your blood their other entree's aren't very expensive and are very good. We ordered: fillet mignon cubes - very tender and actually tasted like steak meat fried squid w/ lime and peper salt - on paper it looks like a typical Cantonese restaurant dish but its very unique here, a bit of Vietnamese influence on the cooking can be seen Lettuce wraps with chicken and shrimp fillings - comes with a head of lettuce cut in half and you use the lettuce as a wrap for the chicken + shrimp filling, the flavors in this dish are very VIetnamese influeced as well with hints of mint. Sour and spicy seafood soup - not for everyone but I liked it even though I typically dislike sour and hot soups. 蔆hunks of tomato, pineapple, and tender fish tail. 蔛uch a strange combination but so good especially with the spicy fish sauce condiment to adjust the spice level to your own liking. Overall it would have been a moderately priced dinner without the lobster but whatever, nothing like recession-busting lobster to make me feel better about unemployment!

I came here for the first time not knowing what to expect. Fortunately for us, small party's get seated quickly. Big party's can expect to wait at least an hour. We were really craving crab and they happen to run out when we placed our order. 蔜he waiter recommended the house special lobster which is the restaurant specialty. 蔣ou will notice that just about everyone in the restaurant is having the lobster or the crab in the house special sauce. 蔕ur lobster was 4.25 Lb ($15.95 a lb) and we wiped the plate clean. The Hot and sour soup ($10.95) 蔵s the same as any chinese place, we just needed a starter dish. The service here is great, servers attend to you quickly, speak english, bring you new plates every time you finish a dish, refill your water, and ask you how everything is tasting and so forth. 蔜he service here really makes me want to come back!

This place is packed! 蔠e had to wait about 45 minutes for a table for 12 Saturday evening. 蔠e ordered the largest special for $200+ (10 dishes, including the house special 蔿obster and crab) and two additional dishes, frog legs and the Bo Luc Lac. 蔔o one else aside from me and another person wanted to order the Bu Luc Lac, but it turned out to be the first dish gone, and everyone liked it. 蔍t was definitely my favorite dish as it was sweet and oh so tender. 蔍've never ordered this at any Vietnamese restaurant before, so I'm curious how it compares. The waiter tried to get us to order more lobster by telling us the dish was small. 蔍'm glad we didn't bc what he called small, we called rather large. 蔍t was more than enough for the whole party. 蔍 don't like lobster in general but the sauce it came marinated in was delicious. 蔜he crab was okay - I've had better at other restaurants. 蔍 surprisingly liked the three flavors Kung Pao, especially the beef portion, as it was crispy, almost like bacon. 蔍t wasn't drenched in sauce either. 蔛omeone didn't like the clams bc of the bland sauce - she said she'd ask them to substitute it with black bean sauce next time. �We had a lot of food and leftovers at the end. �Service was okay - they took a while to get us water and didn't bring us enough glasses. 蔠e had to ask several times for it. 蔜hey also serve boba drinks. 蔕n a random side note - they gave us two plates of the sweetest oranges at the end. 蔛eriously - they must have soaked it in sugar bc it was THAT sweet. I'd like to know where they get their oranges from. 蔄nyway, the total was about $275, or a little less than $25 per person.

parking lot is a nitemare! if you cant find a spot within 2-3 minutes, i suggest you park across the street and walk. it will be MUCH faster. lobster here is LEGIT! i spent more time licking the DELISH marinade off the lobster shell than eating actual lobster. i mashed up plain rice and mixed it into the marinade. i could eat just that alone forever. garlic, red peppers, spicy green pepper, green onion...yum. i usually dont like hardcore chinese restaurants as the food is kinda too heavy, but i LOVED everything here - although i spent the entire nite drinking water cuz of the all the sodium..

This place serves one of the best lobster dish. In my opinion, Asian restaurants do seafood much better than any American restaurants. The restaurant is small but filled to capacity with tables and chairs. So packed, in fact, that once you're seated, you'll find it very hard to get up and navigate your way to wash your hands in the restroom. You'll see that EVERY table orders either the house special lobster/crab AND the house special beef dish. Now I don't know what about this beef dish that makes me addicted to it. The beef is meaty, juicy and melts in your mouth. I don't eat a lot of beef unless it's steak or some kind of Indonesian rendang/empal dishes, but this beef dish is exceptional!

I went to dinner tonight for Father's Day with my parents. We ordered the Beef Cubes French Style, Steamed Fish, the House Lobster Special (5lbs), 1 Heineken, and 3 teas. The total came to $112 without tip. I decided to take my dad here because of all the wonderful Yelp reviews. Boy... they couldn't be more accurate. The food is PHENOMENAL! The service is outstanding. The waiters are so helpful and attentive. It's so freaking crowded here! We arrived at 6pm on the dot and got the only open small table in the whole place! When we left at 8pm, it was completely packed outside! I can't imagine how long people have to wait to eat here if they dont arrive early! My mom is an outstanding chef and SHE was extremely impressed with this place... which is saying a lot.... We plan on going back MANY more times. And you know what....with food this good, who cares about the decor, who cares about the long wait, the cash only, the full parking lot, the crammed table spaces, or the huge bill.

Absolutely amazing! We ordered the clam appetizer (came with soup), the french cut beef, ong choy, and of course the lobster. WAY too much food for two people, but soooooo good. We also had a round of durian shakes. This is some of the best "upscale" Chinese food I have ever had. We came for dinner in the middle of the week so we managed to avoid the long lines that occur on the weekends. It was pricey, but definitely worth it for a special occasion.

I love coming here for their seafood. This place offers good seafood for a very reasonable price. They offer a wide selection and most things I have here are at least on par if not better than most other places. The portions here are decent so you won't leave hungry. This restaurant has very nice interior and does not look shabby at all. The service is alright but you don't go to these places for service. This place doesn't take reservation and it has a terrible wait so come prepared and come early.

My mom took here this past week for a little mom/daughter food bonding experience and I'm glad she did. The place is much bigger than I imagined and service was quick and Asian. If you don't know what I mean, then you haven't been eating any ethnic Asian food lately. The food was pretty top notch but I couldn't tell if the food was mainly Chinese or Vietnamese because they served an equal amount of both. The canh chua was yummy. It's not favorite thing in the world but my mom loves it and this place made a mean one. 蔕ne other thing that blew me away was the lobster. I can't believe my mom would shell out $80 on a 5 lb lobster for only she and I to eat but she did and it was RAD. I love me some lobster and this was so much more flavorful than the old American was of serving it with lemon and butter. I highly recommend getting the lobster if you love yourself some lobster too. The pricing was really reasonable besides the crazy ass 5 lb lobster and the selection was vast so I'll be taking my family back here soon to get our grub on.

No surprises here after reading Jonathen Gold's rave a few months ago I finally got to Newport Seafood with a group of friends. the food was outstanding, the wait was long, the people who worked there were gracious, friendly, and very attentive. The price was high, but not when yo look at what we had. About $40 per person and we had a medium sized lobster and the whole fish special and lots of beer. I will go back many times to Newport Seafood, that I am sure of. They are moving to a larger room in the near future, solely do to the review in the weekly. We shall see if it has any other effects on the glorious chow at Newport. Oh, and lastly as I was leaving I saw a little Yelp! sticker bug in the window that read "Yelper's Loved it!" or something like that. Miss the LA Weekly's review?

This place is great except for the wait and the parking situation. 蔜he restaurant is pretty cramped too but don't let these reasons deter you. 蔕ur family always jokes that we always order the same things here, but it's because they are very consistent on the taste and quality! I'm not a lobster fan, but my family is, so the lobster is a must-order, as most all the reviews suggest here. �We like the salt and pepper shrimp, it seems like a very basic dish, but name another restaurant I would eat the shell and all (maybe not the head) of the shrimp? 蔜he garlic and chili peppers left over on that plate? 蔛coop it up and mix it in your rice...it'll take you to another dimension. Fried tofu...mmm...so airy, crispy, light...how could it be bad for you? Tofu in brown sauce is a favorite of my 3-year-old daughter. 蔛he can just mix this in her rice and that will satisfy her all night. 蔄nd when she's satisfied with her dinner, that means I can enjoy mine as well! Sauteed pea shoots in garlic is really popular as well, very fresh and flavors well balanced. You can make reservations before 6 p.m. 蔠e usually get the 5:30 reservations and by the time you're seated (sometimes you still need to wait a little) and order the food, it's normal dinner time anyway.

The food is solid, and most tables have the house special lobster, the small ones start at about 4 lbs (at $16/lb.). It's a lightly deep fried number with lots of scallions, some chiles, and some other goodies. Easily feeds 3-4 with a few other dishes on the table. Other dishes are mainstream tasty - and I can understand all the fans of this place - but, it's not a 4 or 5 star mind blowing experience.

They are definitely famous for their "house special flavored lobster" here. They can also make it in some other flavors such as black pepper, oyster sauce etc; but make sure you get the house special one. Just dined here over the weekend and the price was $15.99 / lb of lobster. But the minimum size for a lobster is about 4 lbs, so expect to spent at least �65 on one lobster. It was extremely delicious and they stir fried it with peppers, chili, onions and plenty of butter for that extra taste =) The owner of the restaurant is also friendly and likes to make conversation with the diners. Only complaints would be that it is we ordered 4 lbs, but it sort of looked 1 pound less. Also the parking lot here is not sufficient and its hard to find a spot.

Down the street from the previous location, the new look and feel came at a price as the dishes seemed to be missing something. 蔜he house special lobster didn't have the same zing and their kung pao chicken wasn't as crispy. 蔠ith that said, I'm still a fan of this place as it offers flavorful Vietnamese-Chinese food at good prices with a wide selection of seafood. In celebration of the Marine Corps birthday, I joined a friend for the house special lobster coupled with their family set of five dishes; catfish hot & sour soup, pea sprouts, clams, kung pao chicken, and whole fish; I highly recommend ordering from the family set. 蔜he total came out to about $130 before tip which is a very fair price seeing as how this could have easily fed a group of 4-6 but on this one night gluttony fed the two of us. �The dishes have a wonderful smell to them as they come hot out of the kitchen with garlic permeating nicely through most of their dishes. 蔜he spice level can be high so be sure to ask for medium for those of you not accustomed to spicy dishes. 蔜he steamed whole fish is fresh and full of flavor. 蔍f you visit Newport Seafood, you must try their house special lobster; if their not too busy, they'll bring out the live lobster for your approval before carting it back to the kitchen to be prepared. Parking is plentiful along with seating. 蔕n the night that we visited, there were large groups of family and friends seated around us. 蔜he staff was attentive as they refilled our tea pot and changed out our plates littered with the carcass of the lobster and clams. 蔜he decor was pleasant and the restaurant was clean to include the restrooms. 蔇efinitely go in groups of 4 or more and enjoy the new location.

No complaints about this place.... it's pretty darn amazing. It's a big spot... so it was definitely able to accommodate our party of 20. I was there for a graduation dinner so I didn't get to order for myself.... no worries, everything they brought out was DELISH. The crabs are HUGE. the seafood soup (I think it was hot and sour-ish) was wonderful. We must have had.... maybe 10 dishes on our table? All of them good... so I'd say you are pretty safe with anything you order. I can't speak for prices because I didn't see the menu, nor did I see the bill.

It was my mom's birthday and we wanted to try something new. 蔆hinese seafood isn't at all a departure from our usual, but all of these glowing reviews plus a recommendation from a co-worker had me convinced that this restaurant would be worth trying out. 蔖lus, unlike the standard hole-in-the-wall Chinese family restaurant, this one always looked so shiny and appealing from the outside. Well, the interior design is certainly prettier than expected and the food is of undeniably good quality, but unfortunately it's also nothing special. Granted, we didn't order what everyone here recommends. 蔒y mom refused to break the bank for the lobster, so our main seafood dish was the classic Shrimp with Walnuts. 蔣ou can never really go wrong with this dish, and it was tasty but overly fried (and quite disturbing to see as the shrimp looked like it had some pimply disease under the mayo sauce). Beef with pea sprouts was good, the braised tofu pieces were a little small, the spicy minced chicken with lettuce was ho-hum, and oysters with leeks were tasty but sparse and a bit salty. The food was solid, but I could have gotten the same thing elsewhere for a fraction of the price. Add to that the fact that the servers were practically hovering over us, which is completely unexpected for a Chinese restaurant but also quite annoying as it felt like they were pressuring us to order, pay, and leave. Overall, the experience was underwhelming. 蔖erhaps it was our fault for being so unadventurous with our ordering. 蔒ake sure to get the lobster. 蔠e won't...because we probably won't be coming back.

If u cannot afford the lobster, don't' be sad try the fish fillet kung pao or one of there many other yummy items. The fish kung pao is my newest I hardly give a perfect score, but this place is delicious. especially if you can go at lunch time, cheap but good priced seafood. $10 can fill you up with leftovers to go home with. The new location is pretty, sanitary! The staff is funny and nice! MUST EATS: The salt and pepper shrimp is yummy, hate the shell though. French cube beef (Loc Lac) if you get a chance lobster, pricer, but good for a big party. spinach and garlic is tasty and healthy, simple. chicken cashew, the place is seafood but the non seafood dishes are good too. the fried pork chop has too much fat-yuck! If you like asian (sea)food, go here! Lunch time their quick and good eats.

I guess their lobster dish is very popular because I saw it on almost every table. 蔜he lobster can be prepared several ways, I remember the menu listed the ginger-scallion flavor and the plainly steamed. Judging by the name, Newport style is their signature preparation. We hesitated because they showed a chilly pepper icon next to the menu item and we had children who did not like spicy hot food. We asked the waiter if we could order the Newport lobster without the hot pepper. He said no problem. We also ordered their French style beef steak cubes sans hot peppers. �The dishes came out in around 3 minutes. The lobster was wonderful, the sauce was very tasty and not spicy at all. 蔜he restaurant serves lobster in 3 sizes: small, medium and large at $14.99 per pound. The small lobster is around 5 lbs. On our bill, it showed 4.5 lb, and it came to like $60 something just for that dish. The beef was very tender and the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but since we ordered the dish without pepper, I am sure it was not how the original dish tasted like. Bring a few friends so that you can share the cost of the lobster. If you are a lobster lover, two persons can finish a 5 lb lobster with no problem because the shell weighs a bit too.

OG! After all the yelp reviews, I had high expectations. 蔋owever, I was disappointed. 蔕ne thing I didnt try was the lobster, which will be another time. Catfish Hot and Sour Soup - Yes, spicy and hot but 蕋oo much salt. 蔒y friends and I didn't even touch it after the first serving. Clams w/ Spicy Sauce - fresh and very tasty. Recommended Kung Pao Chicken - Not tasty. Sauteed Peasprouts - I wasn't expecting this to be spectacular. Beff Loc Lac (French Style) - Yes, like you many yelpers said, "tasty and tender" 蔛ince the meat isnt cut evenly. 蔣ou get some that are tender and some that are tough. Overall, I'd get this again Rice (Regular steamed) - Rice is a day old. 蔇ry, not warm and fluffy. Steamed Fish - Fish was fresh but it was lacking soy sauce and it was small. Service: Service was great. 蔒ost waiters speak english, canto, mandrine, and viet. �I would recommend that you guys come early. 蔈xpect a wait after 6pm.

This place is definitely a restaurant to bring your nitpicky Asian parents. The restaurant is very clean and fairly large with a number of round tables with a lazy susan and a couple of square tables in the back. They also have a semi-private area with those Chinese screens for larger parties. The service is better than your run of the mill Asian restaurant. I like it when they serve my soup for me and refill my tea right when I flip the top over :). The food is excellent. We ordered salt and pepper pork, hot and sour soup, rice (they charge about 2.50 extra for this but it's a HUGE portion and us four couldn't even finish it), small size of the garlic and green onion lobster - 4.5lbs, and mayo shrimp with walnuts. I've never been a fan of hot and sour soup but they add strips of pork to theirs which is a nice touch. The piping hot salt and pepper park is nicely coated and fried. However, I wish it had a bit more flavor. Mayo shrimp was probably one of the best I've ever had. The mayo wasn't overwhelming and they put a ton of the candied walnuts. Too much mayo makes me want to gag but fortunately this version did not induce yuckiness. The garlic and green onion lobster, although AMAZING and just the way I like it, was a whopping $71.78!!! This number kicked my ass and my wallet. I was not prepared for that - maybe they should put the daily $/lb up on the wall next to the hostess's area...then that would calm me down. Overall, great food, service and environment...just a little pricey for me plus there are SO MANY KIDS here. I counted 4 families that had children and two of them had rowdy kids that banged their chopsticks or climbed on their parents. Didn't your parents tell you that banging your chopsticks is bad juju!?

Beat the long lines and crowds by going during weekend lunch time. The food is discounted and the food tastes even more amazing at 30% off. Dishes are $5-8 during lunch time. You must order the cubed beef and the lobster... oOoooo *mouth watering.

Lobster and Crab are my two favorite things to eat next to meat , cheese, and dessert. Newport does is just right. The house special lobster is finger licking good. The deep fried crab in salt and pepper is a must try. If I feel like I have extra $ to burn I will order a few pounds of steamed shrimp. Other must tries are the french style beef. For tofu lovers like me, I always order the fried tofu too. With your meal you get complimentary boba drinks which is really great if you have kids or just want a little sweet treat with your meal. Service is pretty fast but, the wait can be very long. If you are visiting for dinner, try to come before 7pm and it won't be too bad.

I came here last night to celebrate my friend's birthday. 蔋e chose this restaurant which was a little far out of the way to get here but, it was his birthday. �Newport Seafood is a good restaurant to take your family or bunch of friends as it can accommodate large parties. 蔍 was amazed as to how efficient their system they have in place for seating their customers. 蔜hey are prompt and well organized in calling out the ticket numbers that you must have to be seated. 蔔ote: 蔜hey do not take reservations. 蔠e got seated within 10-15 minutes after all our party members arrived. �As for the service, I give them two thumbs up. 蔠e had a large party of 10 and the waiters and bussers came every 10 minutes to check up on our table to see if we required anything. 蔍 found this amazing since most of the Chinese restaurants that I have gone to pay little attention to their customers. 蔄t one point, one of the busser who spoke very little English tried to provide our table with a wine glass in which he thought was a regular water glass. 蔕nce he realized that he brought the wrong glass, he went back and brought out a wine bucket full of ice. 蔍t was hilarious. 蔠ell, at least I thought so. Now, for the food. 蔒y friend order the house lobster which he claimed was "to die for". 蔠e also ordered a beef dish, a steam red cod and some other dishes. 蔜he calamari and deep friend tofu was delicious. 蔍 have never eaten tofu that was deep friend and crunchy on the outside yet the tofu on the inside remained soft and silky. 蔄s for the lobster, my friend was right. 蔍t was scrumptious. 蔍t was flavored with a lot of spices and the lobster was LARGE. 蔐et me emphasize the LARGE again because when the check came, the lobster cost $120. 蔍 think all ten of us were shocked at the price of the lobster. 蔐et's just say that was our common post on Facebook that evening. I would recommend Newport Seafood. 蔜he service and food were exceptional. �This was definitely worth driving out to the Eastside.

Pretty good Vietnamese-Chinese seafood restaurant, a "Crustacean" wanna-be for east-LA. 蔜he Vietnamese side makes the Chinese dishes a bit lighter and less oily which is a good thing. 蔜he food is good but not stunning that's why its only a 3-starrer. 蔄nd the prices are way higher than what you can get at a neighborhood seafood restaurant in Alhambra or Monterey Park. 蔜hat's why there aren't too many (if any) local Chinese people eating there.

WOO HOOO, found another MSG* central in SGV. So finally tried this place after keep passing by everyday on my was to the gym. It was Sunday night with a medium-large group, we had to wait for awhile. The place is very crowded, so best to go when they just opened for dinner service. The food is ok, flavors are familiar and sharp, emmm enhanced. It's one of those things that go together well with rice. Wait staff are nice, quick service. 蔖arking usually sucks in that area, but just park outside on the street. *(there's nothing wrong with liking MSG, I do)

I was told they are known for their lobsters. 蔅ut to my surprise, everything else on the menu is very good as well. 蔜he softshell crabs, their signature beef dish, kung pao shrimps, the list goes on and on. 蔛ometimes we closed our eyes and picked to an item on the menu for something new, we have never been served anything that we didn't enjoy. 蔍t just makes it so much harder the next time trying to thin out the things to order. The only thing that I can ding them is that they are cash only place, no cc. 蔖arking can be a pain sometimes but it's worth the trouble.

For all the hype that goes behind eating a good lobster meal, I hardly find any places in Los Angeles that live up to the demand. Newport Seafood hits the lobster dinner bull's eye. Although lobsters at Asian restaurants isn't a new thing, Newport gives you exactly what you order, pound for pound. When they say their lobsters are five pounds, you get that five pounds. A LOT of other places usually short change you. By default, the lobster comes stir fried in a spicy cornucopia of garlic, green onions, chili, salt, and pepper. There's always plenty of meat and lobster eggs (for those of you that are hardcore). For a side dish, a plate of stir fried veggies (you can order a variety, whatever is in season). For two people, this dinner will run you around $80-$100, but definitely well worth it. Don't bother with the Visa, because they only take cash here. All in all, one of THE BEST places to satisfy that craving for those tasty oceanic bugs.

This place is awesome, I've been only twice, but it has been great food everytime I'm there. 蔉irst time I was there, it was a Sunday evening, and packed like crazy. 蔜he place is has a nice ambience, simple but elegant. 蔍 like the fact they have a bunch of tanks near the front filled with seafood. There were about ten of us, and boy did we have a feast. 蔠e had the 2 medium lobsters (ever so tasty with their special sauce that it gets cooked in, a definite must when you come), a whole black bass (cut in half and cooked two different ways, both extremely tasty), clams, walnut shrimp, beef tenderloins, water spinach, and I forget whatelse. 蔠e came back a second time just recently, smaller group and earlier time. 蔔o wait time since it was around like 4 in the afternoon, definitely the better time to go there. 蔇idn't try anything new, and everything was just as tasty. 蔋owever, I must issue a warning, make sure you're ready to use your hands when getting the lobster cause you're gonna have to get the lobster out of the shell somehow. 蔍t's rather difficult/near impossible to get it out just using chopsticks and a fork, trust me, I've tried.

The best lobster ever. This restaurant know how to cook a lobster. In addition, the price of the lobster is cheap if you compare it to other fancy restaurants. I wouldn't say that the service here is good but it's a lot better than some chinese restaurants. It gets pretty crowded during dinner time and parking also gets crazy. If you don't have any patience with parking and you are coming here for dinner, just go straight to street parking. Just remember, order the house special lobster.

If you haven't had newport lobster, you haven't had lobster like this. 蔈ach lobster is at least 4-6 pounds with lobster roe, jalapeno peppers, garlic and onion is a savory stir fry to perfection. 蔮etween the 6 of us we still could finish it and it is lobster price. The fish, crab, black pepper beef, clams are all good too.... but come for the lobster and you won't be sorry. 蔍'd recommend a very early dinner it gets really crowded fast. 蔜he decor is pretty awesome for a chinese restaurant so bring people to impress with good food, service and style!

Ahh Newport Tan Cang Seafood. New remolded place is beautiful. Love the decor. Had a very cozy oriental feel to it. Had lunch here today for the firs time. It was delicious! Lunch is a great time to go because there's not a lot of people. Entree were at a very reasonable price. They also give u compliementary hot and sour soup(mouth watering). My bf, bro and I ordered...Kung pao chicken, Bo Lu Lac(to die for!), Yang Chow Fried Rice(best fried rice I tried so far), and Whole Salt and Pepper Crab ..oh and magolian beef. Yes, that was a lot of food but boy was it fulfilling down to the last bite! Yum! Crab was tender, and the flavoring was just right too. I really enjoyed the food and the service.

Oh, I love this place! 蔍f you are looking for Asian-style seafood in the SGValley, especially crab or lobster, you can't do much better. When we have large clients from overseas visit us in our office in Arcadia, we will give them a choice between Maison Akira in Pasadena or this place, and invariably they pick Newport. We've had both the Spider Crab and the Lobster, and both are excellent. 蔐ike most Chinese-seafood places the shelfish is cut apart and coated with sauce when it arrives, so eating is convenient (no crackers necessary). 蔜he clams are also quite good. 蔈ven their non-seafood dishes are excellent, as we usually order Kung-Pao chicken and it's quite good as well. If the restaurant has a down-side it's the crowds and parking. 蔜he place fills up fast so going earlier is better. 蔄lso, the parking lot is not very large, and we end up parking on the street in front. 蔄part from that inconvenience Newport is an excellent choice, especially compared to Sam Woo seafood.

Wow, so good! We got the lobster (you have to!), beef, walnut shrimp, fried tofu, vegetables and fish maw soup. Everything was delicious. it's all the usual stuff you'd order at any chinese restaurant when you're eating family style, BUT every dish here was just better than it usually is at other places. Food aside, this place also surprised me in a pleasant way. The service was really good. The waiters were friendly and quick to bring more tea, more rice, or whatever it is you ask for. And the interior of the restaurant is actually decorated - modern and clean! To put it in perspective, that's all pretty unusual for a chinese restaurant that serves good food. No wonder it was packed on a sunday night. I'll definitely be back to try the clams. Definitely bring a big group if you're going to eat here, so you can try a few different dishes!

This place has always been famous for their seafood (crab, lobster) and I'm glad that they moved to a larger space as the old one was positively cramped. 蔜his new space even has sectioned off "rooms" so you can get more privacy if you're in a big party. Even though they're a seafood restaurant, we've liked their other Southern Chinese dishes (sauteed fresh vegetables, stir-fried beef, etc.). The servers are also great for a Chinese restaurant. 蔜hey don't hesitate to make recommendations and will help you come to a good balance of dishes to order for your table.

went here with a good friend of mine upon his recommendation to get some Chinese food. i was expecting to get some greasy grub and fortune cookies, but was pleasantly surprised by the fact they specialized in seafood, which i love. we got seated fairly quickly on a Friday afternoon and immediately upon sitting, we were served some soup (sweet & sour). lunch entrees were $5.75 each and we ended up ordering seafood noodles, salt/pepper pork chops, salt/pepper shrimp, and whole grilled tilapia. the seafood noodles were amazing and their slight crispiness was softened by the sauce and seafood mix on top of it. the salt/pepper pork chops were awesome and delicious! only complaint was that the chops were very small and i found myself nibbling around the bones. the salt/pepper shrimp was the highlight and tasted great despite the modest seasoning. though i usually de-shell shrimp before i eat them, i found myself keeping the shell on because of the seasoning and just beheaded the shrimp before consuming. lastly, the grilled tilapia had a nice subtle flavor, which was a welcome change from the other salted dishes and tasted even better when dipped in the sweet and sour sauce that accompanied the fish. definitely would come back again to try out their crab and lobster (which are seasonally priced) with a larger group of friends!

This restaurant is great! 蔍 recommend the crab or lobster, its what they are known for. 蔖ersonally, I prefer the crab but thats just 'cause I prefer crab over lobster. 蔅ut you really cant go wrong with anything here, I havnt tried anything that I havnt liked. �I suggest you go for lunch if your the frugal type, they have many lunch special plates for about $5. 蔉rom this menu I really like the kung pao chicken. Newport gets busy quite often so its best to go at odd times like early dinner or late lunch or what not. 蔛ervice is pretty good for an asian restaurant in the SGV. 蔜hey usually have ample staff to take care of demand. 蔄lso, there is another location in diamond bar off the 60 freeway. 蔍've only eaten there once but I hear from an employee friend that the original chef of all the recipes works there. �Only draw back about Newport is the parking situation, which really isnt their fault. 蔅ut if you go at the times I suggested then there shouldnt be to much of a problem. 蔄nd even if it is peak time and the parking lot is full just park on the local side streets, its worth the walk. �Bottom Line: 蔊reat food

Probably one of my favorite chinese restaurants. If you go for lunch they have a lunch specials menu with a lot of tasty dishes from 5 to 7 bucks. My personal favorite is the salt and pepper pork which I think they do better than other places. Also they serve a mean hot and sour soup. Comes free with your lunch specials and usually served immediately. Every dish I have tried here has been delicious. I usually eat 3+ bowls of rice when I eat here. Try it out!

This place was pretty awesome but I'm not sure if our host knowing the owner had anything to do with it. 蔕n to the review! Seafood was probably some of the freshest you can find in the San Gabriel area. 蔕ur host ordered Shark Fin Soup, two Lobsters (as pictured in the photos), a huge crab, cabbage in preserved tofu sauce, stewed clams, and Yang Chow (?) Fried Rice. 蔍'd have to say that the Lobster was probably the best out of everything we had. Lots of meat, a hint of sweetness, good savory taste overall, with a small kick of spice. 蔜he crab was good too but it felt like a step-down from the lobster. Fried rice was pretty good because they put a ton of shrimp in there. I didn't have any of the clams but people who had it said it was really well done! 蔕verall: 4.5 out of 5! Service was great. 蔄fter they served the crustaceans, they'd come in every 10 to 15 minutes to see if we needed a plate changing. 蔜hey were also quick to grab anything you asked for. 蔛o, overall: 5 out of 5! Atmosphere was definitely different from most seafood places in the area. 蔍t was a definitely modern in the room we had and it was definitely clean. 蔜he place didn't reek of fish and seafood either. 蔇efinitely a 5 out of 5! Recommendations: Lobster! The stuff is great; even on the next day as leftovers, they still taste fresh (and it's good in ramen :P) My one complaint is probably the parking. The place gets busy so head out a bit earlier or get reservations! 蔄nd, as of this writing, they don't have an alcohol license which sucks b/c nothing goes better w/ crustaceans than beer!

Let me sums this up: Food - 5 stars - best chinese vietnamese restaurants in LA, maybe in California Service - about 3.5 stars Value - 3 stars.... because despiste most of the dishes ranging from $9 - $15, the lobster costs up to $90. They charge over $16 per pound and for a table of 5 or more they will serve you a 5 lbs lobster costing upt $90. Even lobster at high end Beverly HIlls restaurant does not cost that much. It is REALLY good though... so I will eat it again and again. It used to be cash only - which is pretty painful when you get the lobster. Who carry cash in LA nowadays anyway. Haven't been back here since they move to the new location, so hopefully they take credit card now. Planning to come here again 蔲or chinese new year.

One word = YUMMY! Me & my friends ate here tonight for the first time. My friend Jackie suggested it and also said we should try the lobster special and wow was it good and fulfilling. We were a total of 3.25 (plus my infant baby) and along w/ the lobster special (size small), we ordered coconut shrimp and the clams. I must say, we were so impressed w/ all the dishes. It was so fresh, tasty and suburb. We were so full we still had a few lobsters and shrimp left. We divided the bill 3 ways and I did not complain on how much I had to pay w/ the amount of lobster and other seafood I ate. I would definitely come back. One bad thing is that, they do not take reservations and the wait - depending on when and time you go - can take awhile, but not too bad. Setting is clean and overall great experience. The servers/workers were really friendly too and funny. Great food = great dinner. :)

Only down side is the wait if you get there around 7-8PM (especially if you have a big group, wait can be up to 1 hour). 蔍 recommend going there around 6PM, busy, but not too bad where you have to wait. 蔊uess there is a reason why they are always so packed... :)

My 蕇isters and i go, all the time since they were in the smaller place and even if we're not BIG spenders like lobster but their employees always treated us like VIP's. ����Their food stays constantly fresh and good no reheat, and the speed is great, even if there's a long wait at peak hours. I love that they have lunch specials. highly recommend: family package meals (they allow subs and if the sub is more they will let you sub with payiing the difference) lobster kung pao chicken basil clams walnut shrimp salt and pepper pork chops fried tofu

My wife and I went here, we got the sauteed clams, a house specialty beef dish, as well as a house special fried rice. Quality for all dishes was top notch, but I get the feeling that this is a place you have to go in a group of 4+ to really get the good menu items. They have entire Lobster and Crab dishes, which looked delicious, but it being only two of us, ordering that mountain of crustacean would have been a waste. Will return, this place has 5 star potential...I just need to get the signature dishes to give it out.

My parents, older sister, and cousin decided to come here the night before my birthday last Wednesday night. Foolishly thinking that the place wouldn't be so bad on a Wednesday we arrived to find the parking lot packed to the brim and groups of people waiting outside. Bad idea. I hopped out of the car and went inside to secure a ticket. Seeing no one at the front desk, I waited around until someone could at least give me a ticket for a table for 5. One of the older gentlemen (I don't know if he was a manager or not) singled me out as he walked towards me and asked: "How many?" I then replied: "5". He then said, "Come with me." I smiled to myself as there were groups of people probably waiting longer than my 15 seconds but no complaints from me. =) As we only had 5 people in our group, we decided to order a small dinner set which included fish, some sort of kung pao chicken, clams, and seafood soup. We also ordered the French-style beef separately. The food came out fast except for the fish which finally arrived at the very end. However by this time we were all very full. Unfortunately I am not a seafood eater (due to a mild allergy) so I cannot comment on those plates but the French-style beef was incredible. Moist, tender, and black-peppery delicious, every bite leaves you craving for more. The chicken was good but it does sort of wear down on you after a while and the portions they give you are extremely generous. My family has eaten here before but I thought I'd write a review after the 3rd time. I think everyone (at least everyone that can eat seafood) agrees that the food is very well done and there was not a dish that wasn't liked. In addition to what you order they provide tea, ice water (upon request), and sweet oranges at the end of your meal. The wait staff (all male, curiously enough) walk around frantically to clear plates, fill waters, or answer questions. They thankfully accept credit cards and they help package your leftovers into boxes that you can take home with you. On our way out we noticed some of the same people still waiting for a table after my family and I had already been seated and had finished eating. Ouch. I would recommend coming here early if you have a large group, because dinner time at even the weekday is pretty damn busy. I only got lucky this time but I don't think for future visits the speed in which I was seated will be as quick. I only shudder to think how bad the wait is on the weekends. The parking situation is likewise really bad during the meal-time rush. If you can stomach all that then the food that awaits you (whether you go for the herb-garnished lobster, the tender French-style beef, or the glistening sweet & sour pork) you are in for a treat.

Came here, after seeing overwhelming high rating review for a Chinese Restaurant, �the restaurant has very nice interior, with good a/c. the table and chair are good quality not typical from most chinese restaurant, both the table and floor is Mable. Order some lunch special, is quite good, probably not as good portion as some chinese restaurant, but quality is there, the stream rice is quite good, probably use thai rice. 蔜hey you use lots of orange, about 2 full slice of regular orange for just 2 people, and they are mid sweet. Great customer service, good interior, and food, has everything needed for 5 stars. It does has some msg, but it won't get my stomach ups-etch like I would with Panda Express.

This restaurant is intriguing. The tables are large and I'm a tall woman so I can appreciate that. I gave it 4 stars only because it was freezing inside and the fish I ordered had no meat on it, all bones. Granted I ordered the flounder per the recommendation of the waiter. I told him I wanted an open faced fish and he said the trout would be too much, but now I'm regretting not going with the trout. The sauce on top was fantastic, they really love their garlic! I'm a big fan of garlic.The waiters pay attention to you and their hot sauce is fantastic. Don't order the frog legs, there's no meat on those either. That's what I get for not knowing what to order. A friend of mine told me they have the best lobster with garlic sauce, so I will try that next time. I have had lobster only once in my life and it was nasty so i never order it anywhere. But I was told lobster isn't supposed to be chewy and rubbery like I had it, and I was assured that the lobster at Newport is high quality. And you can order different sized lobsters and share it with a group of people. I will be doing that next time because I can't stand the thought of going through life hating such a beautiful sea creature. The parking is good, but get there early for dinner. It starts to get crazy around 6.

Arguably one of the best Asian restaurant in the San Gabriel Valley, if not the entire Los Angeles area, for both quantity, quality, and value (but not necessarilty in that order). I make it a point to have lunch here each and every time I drive to L.A. to visit family. Many of the same employees have been working here since the days the restaurant was once located a few blocks west in the 7-11 strip mall. As described in hundreds of other reviews, the seafood is super fresh, but also the Chinese greens - of which my favorite is Chinese broccoli, served in generous quantities.

I hate reading long, meticulous reviews because, well in journalism class I was taught no one cared hence articles were broken down so much in paragraphs. Great service. Order the lobster. Order pretty much anything that you like because they make an amazing dish out of whatever ingredients you prefer. lastly, order che ba mau because although you could get it anywhere, it's a refreshing desert after an amazing scrumptious meal.

I can't say anything bad about Newport...tasty food, reasonable prices (lunch specials in the $5 to $8 range), quick service. I do wonder about the name though. Newport...it's nowhere near Newport Beach and I don't see a relation to the cigarettes the brothas like to smoke. Anyways, I'll put my curiosity aside and comment on their excellent basil fish fillet and the pretty good kung pao chicken. Newport's classy ambiance and the complimentary desert oranges set Newport apart from the other Chinese places in the SGV,

There is a reason why this place is rated as high as it is. Because it's amazing! Imagine a seafood restaurant that you could bring your not-so-Asian or Asian washed friends and family--Newport is the place. The waiters know enough English to take your orders, even if you don't know Chinese. And even better, this restaurant, unlike most Asian places, focus on the service. �The food is, to say the least, excellent. What they feed the lobsters to get them as big as they are--I'm not really sure. All those good things said, there is of course price. 蔒ore expensive than 80% of restaurants. 蔜heir "large" lobster plate will run you about $100 and their crab dish starts at about $35-40, of course family style. �As for their veggies, anything with seafood will run $15 a plate, and so on. They charge for rice and soda (still in the typical can that we have come to love about Asian places) is about $2 per can. Look to spend around $40+ a person if you're going for the big seafood items.

The food here just absolutely explodes with flavor! Better than anything you will find in Chinatown! Lunch specials very reasonably priced with generous portions. Amicable servers. I have NEVER ate Chinese with out it needing soy sauce, hot mustard, [which they don't carry], chili sauce, or some other type of condiment. That is until I ate here! The food is simply that good & flavorful!!! Can't wait to get back! Amazing!

Based on fellow yelpers reviews, went with my sis and cousin last wed and loved it! We made sure we were there 615-630P. By 730 there were about 15 peeps outside waiting for a table. When we got there, we got lucky because we got a table right away by the glass window.. ( not so good later, since peeps were staring at our food from the outside =(. We ordered the ff: Seafood with bean curd soup Clam with black bean soup Shrimp with walnuts Beef ( french style) = with onions and pepper They were all very tasty! 蔜he waiters were all very friendly as well, Even with all the peeps waiting outside, we weren't 蕆ushed to pay or anything ! i will def come back... will def try the lobster dish next time.

When you go to downtown LA in the fashion district and walk around for hours trying to find the right stuff, whatever floats your boat, fashion wise. You work up an appetite. Especially when you didn't get a chance to have any breakfast for the morning before doing any walking. I brought some more family and friends to share a variety of dishes, like Pea sprouts, On choy, Mongolian Beef, mixed meat chow mein, salt & pepper shrimp, Kun Pao chicken. Everything is always great never a bad dish.

Lobster is soooo good...and the clams..beansprout, beef..mmmm everything i tried so far was so tasty!! When I first ate there, there portions were so big and colorful and tasty! 蔵t reminded me of the movie "Spirited Away" by Miyazaki Hayao; the food in that anime looked so good because of its portion and the color! And it looked so juicy! Anyway, it satisfies me cuz it makes me feel like I'm eating the anime's food LOL It's good to go with a big party.. The lobster is expensive and everytime ago we spend more or less than 200, but always above 100. I don't like the fact that they don't take credit cards when you have to spend a lot of money... But oh well..afterall the food it's really really good!

Yeay!! 蔠hen we eat there (family of 4 adults and 2 small kids) spent around $150-200. We take a lot of food home; lobster, fish, clams. �The cons: parking and waiting. 蔊o before rush hours, for dinner arrive around 5 ish. 蔍f you show up by 6, you'll have to wait for at least half an hour.

My parents took me here tonight for my birthday and this place is amazing. We ordered the House special lobster, salt and pepper crab, deluxe vegetables, and house special chow mein. The lobster was delicious as expected, and I was surprised at how large the chow mein was. On the menu it's just called house special noodles, but it's basically a huge plate of chicken chow mein and for 6.95 quite a bargain. In the front there's a tank of these gigantic (and by gigantic I mean gigantic. These things are something you'd expect to see in an aquarium not at a restaurant) crabs. I didn't see it on the menu and my mom asked about them and he said that you can order them for 27.99 a pound and they're about 8-9 lbs each. That's quite an expensive lobster, but I don't think you can get these things anywhere else. As I'm writing this I wish I took a picture to post. Also, at the time of writing this there was 626 reviews, which I find fitting since this is the 626 area code, but I guess mine is gonna make it 627.

This place would have gotten a 5 stars EXCEPT i had a bad stomache afterwards and I think there's lots of msg. Perhaps it was the clams that made my tummy hurt? In terms of taste, it was delicious. We got the $78 set menu (clams with basil, steamed tilapia, crab, veggie, kung pao chicken, sour soup) with an additional lobster as an extra to the set menu. I was hesitant about the kung pao chicken being on the menu. But boy oh boy, it was delicous. Best kung pao chicken EVER. I will give this place another try though when i'm back in the area.

I came here with two other friends on a friday night and it took about 15 minutes to get seated, not bad at all. We ordered the house special lobster and french beef (bo luc lac). It is hard to describe how incredibly delicious it all was. The French Beef (bo luc lac...shaking beef-whatever you wanna call it), was perfectly seared with crispy garlic bits and seasoning that would drive your palate wild. I microwaved the leftover the next day and it was still damn good. The wait staff was friendly and responsive, a definite plus for an asian restaurant. The price range will depend on what you order obviously. I'm certain it is possible to keep it relatively low if you're in a big group ordering a variety of dishes. But I do recommend just splurging a bit to put yourself in lobster heaven. Just make sure you have a DD to take you home after the lobster induced food coma.

The food is a solid four, but the service was terrible. I went with my extended family, and when we're together, there's always enough food to feed twice as many people. (There were ten of us at this dinner and we probably ordered 13 or 14 dishes.) For some reason, beyond anyone's comprehension, they decided to serve us ALL our dishes at ONE TIME. (I'm not even exaggerating.) Who does that?!?! Plates kept coming out and the waiters were rude, like it was our fault there was no more room for anything on the lazy susan. We finally had to start passing the dishes around the table, each taking a scoop so we could quickly empty the plate and get rid of it. I'm surprised I was able to distinguish between the different dishes, considering that in the frenzy, most of my food was just glopped on my plate in one huge, disgusting-looking mess. Worst dining experience ever.

Been to New Port a few times. This place is pretty loud and noisy. Not recommended for romantic occasions. 蔋ighly recommend the seafood: elephant 蔯lam sashimi, House Special Elephant Clam are to die for. This is the best place for elephant clam. Lobster, crab and other seafood are excellent too. Other dishes -- like French style beef, Chinese Broccoli, etc. are just ok. They are very greasy. The oil blocked my taste buds. Again, rule of thumb -- always order the what the restaurant is known for, you can never go wrong!

I'd been dying to try this place for some time just based on the fabulous yelp reviews. I'd been like twice before this time but the line was too long and/or we were too hungry to wait. Finally, we came on a Sunday night and it was not so crazy. 15 minutes later, we were sitting in a booth by the window. Note: air must seep through the window because it was pretty nipply. :-) Anyways we had time to peruse the menu while we were waiting so we ordered pretty much as soon as we sat. One small order of the house special lobster (4-5 lbs at $15.99/lb), the French style beef (aka bo luc lac, $11.95) and large leaf pea sprouts ($9.25). Totally enough food for the four of us. The lobster was by far the best I've ever had. So flavorful with the spices, onions, shrimp/seafood bits and flour-type crispy coating on the shell. The lobster was so big - there were 4 claws filled with so much meat. Also the most expensive lobster I've ever eaten. But worth it, well once in awhile. The beef was super tasty and tender too. It was so good, we even slopped up the lettuce and tomatoes on the plate that was probably more for the aesthetic of the dish. The pea sprout dish was so small. I think I only got two small servings. And I wish I'd gotten more to balance out the strong flavors of the other dishes. Luckily white rice was 50 cents per person (I think that's cheap) and unlimited. But very good veggies - fresh and saut巈d with garlic and not too oily. Service was very good. All the waiters are guys cause according to ours - women can't carry around those giant plates of lobsters. A little sexist. Anyways, order was taken quickly, food came out quickly and plates were changed out halfway through our meal. Also in an attempt to get a table quicker when we got there, my uncle told them we were from out of town. I dunno if we moved up on the list any -probably now but the owner or manager came by near the end of the meal to chat and find out how the food was. Also word quickly spread and another waiter who was from the same city as my uncle came by the chat. He even gave us extra dessert, which was just sliced oranges, but still, so he could continue talking to us. The whole meal set me back $125. That's what the minus one star is for. Ooooh, that hurt my wallet just a bit. Worth it though. Although, I'm not sure, they might have overcharged my credit card - maybe I was so full I wasn't paying attention, the bill and credit card slip I signed seemed to have different amounts. I can't seem to get the right amount when I add up all my dishes. But that's my fault - should've checked more carefully.

Nice "zen" decor for a "real" Chinese place, efficient waiters and super-tasty food - just go. 蔍f your wallet's feeling a little thin, go for the $28 four-course meal. 蔍t'll feed at least 4 people with seafood or catfish soup, clams in basil, sauteed pea sprouts and kung pao chicken (it's a seafood place, but this was a tasty dish). 蔍 think I ordered this 7 years ago for the same price. 蔅ut you'll want to save up to order the special lobster or crab dishes. And the service is pretty good (by Asian-style standards). 蔜he waiters constantly circle the dining room, delivering dishes, picking up dirty plates, delivering clean plates midway thru the meal (!), filling water.

Special lobsters was superb. In fact, that was the only thing I really-really like. It was spicy and very tasty. I could eat the whole plate by myself. Though, its a bit pricy, its so worth it. The texture of the lobster's meat was more like crabs than lobster. I wonder why. Sadly, other dishes were not up to expectation. Black bean sauce clams, were just okay. I had a better one. Kangkung with chilly paste was bland. Worst, fried squid was oily and chewy. Since all my friends told me that the smoothie (with boba inside) is good, I ordered an avocado smoothie. It was pretty good. I should order the durian instead, because everyone said thats the best..

The specialty dishes on the menu are pretty average in my opinion though it is different than the usual Chinese restaurant (because it's more like fusion between Chinese and Vietnamese cusine). The lobster was good, and that's what they are known for, but it's pretty expensive... about 3/5 of the total of the check. I don't think I will return again for a casual meal unless my guest demand on going to this place, also, parking is terrible.

This is my favorite Chinese seafood restaurant. 蔐ike other Chinese restaurants, it can get very loud and, during the dinner crush, it is unbelievably crowded, but the food is worth it. 蔊et there before 4:45pm to get seated immediately, otherwise, be prepared to wait 1-2hours (they don't take reservations). My favorites: Newport Special Lobster - The sauce I amazing enough to suck off the shell. Steamed whole fish - Get rock cod if you have a choice. Mix the sauce over rice and eat it with the fish. 蔣ou won't be disappointed. Steamed live shrimp - I just love big juicy shrimp dipped in the accompanying sauce. 蔇on't forget to suck out the good stuff in the heads. The French beer was pretty good considering I'm not a fan of beer.

It was my brother's graduation when we drove through the deadly LA traffic for over 2 hours to get to San Gabriel and waited another hour just to eat here. Was it worth all that trouble? Yes sir! The food came very fast despite the amount of people they were serving. Waiters were efficient, food was delicious, and the interior design was very appealing to the eye! Two thumbs up! Not to mention the place was amazingly clean. Finally, the awaited lobster. Even after stuffing myself with many previous dishes, I still had the stomach for more. Not that the food wasn't filling, it was just that good! 蔍 proceeded as I took my first bite out of the tasty, succulent, scrumptious, delightful piece of lobster. Mm mm good! I think I just spent an hour in heaven.

I've only been there once, on a Thursday evening and was surprised by how crowded it was. 蔠e had to wait about 20 minutes for a table around 7:00, and when we left, it was even more crowded with people waiting outside. Was it worth the wait? 蔉or the area, yes. I thought the food was pretty good and the portions were good-sized. 蔜he place specializes in seafood and everyone around us was ordering big plates of lobster and crab (which I actually don't like, especially if you have to deal with shells). We ordered: beef with pea shoots; garlic shrimp; chicken with mushrooms; and fried tofu. 蔜he food was on the salty side and leaned more toward an Americanized Panda style rather than being real authentic but that is fine with me because that's how I prefer it. The ingredients were fresh, everything was tasty and aside from the salt my only complaint is the pea shoots were very chewy. 蔜he dishes looked attractive, too. I really liked the way they decorated the room - very classy and contemporary with tables not too close together. The noise level was high. 蔛ervice was good - we didn't have to wait to get someone's attention or ask more than once for anything. 蔖rior to the current owners, the place was an HK cafe-type place and before that, a Marie Callendars. The place looks soooooo much nicer now - they really fixed it up and it bears no resemblance to the former restaurants (the interior, that is - the exterior still looks like a Marie Callendar). �Also, good luck trying to find a parking spot in the lot. Luckily there is lots of street parking not too far away. 蔍 wouldn't mind going back!

one large house special lobster, the house special elephant clam (2 flavors), vietnamese style beef, fish maw soup, string beans, ong choi, seafood fried egg noodles, house special clams--eight items, total $303, not including tips. the lobster was meaty--it was good but after reading all the rave about it, I think I had too much expectation for it to be GREAT--which it wasn't. It's a one time try for me. Everything else was just ordinary and can be found at most of the other chinese restaurants around town. What I REALLY enjoyed was the vietnamese style beef (so tender and flavorful), and the clams (very fresh). Probably will come here again, but not for the expensive stuff.

This is an excellent restaurant. Service is fast and polite. The food is great. We were visiting LA (for UCLA orientation) and take a long trip to San Gabriel to dine at Newport Tan Cang based on Yelp review. Although we didn't order crab/lobster for lunch. We did order soft shell crab and 5 other dishes for 4 people (2 teenagers). The food was so great that our luke-warm Chinese food eating teenagers were eating non-stop. We old guys love it. When the bill came, this is also a pleasant surprise. The price is pretty decent. I can't get this price even closer in the Bay Area. My wife already told her friends in LA about this place. We will visit again next time.

We went on Saturday 5pm. We had to wait for an hour. But we went shopping at the Mitsuwa just on the opposite, so the waiting wasn't that bad. We ordered special lobster, clams, catfish soup, garlic squid, and stir fried vegetable. All came much faster than expected. And all were really really good. The lobster 7.5pounds was huge and amazing! The meat, really juicy. So we were there to celebrate a friend's birthday, and although their dessert is only oranges, when they heard this, the waiter made us a plate of oranges arranged so it looked like a smiley face, with a candle. It was very nice of them. All in all, this place is exceptional! Couldn't think of a single bad comment.

Excellent food and service. However, do ask for the price on the stuff that said seasonal price. Or else you will eat a crab that cost $400 (Waiter will tell you it's good and never tell you the price unless you ask). It was worth it but if I know it was that much I might get something else.

I did not grow up eating seafood. 蔒y people don't eat much in the way of crustaceans. 蔅ut a foodie friend of mine told me about Newport Seafood Restaurant, and I was already familiar with the very popular Golden Deli in the same plaza, so I went with a friend who loves seafood. �First impression? 蔖arking sucks. 蔍t doesn't suck, it swallows. 蔠hat the? 蔜wo wildly popular, no reservation, cash only restaurants in the same tiny parking lot? 蔄fter a few visits, I realized it ain't worth it . . . the parking lot, that is, the food is very much worth it. 蔍 just parallel park in front of the houses on the small side street and walk 50 yards or so, its not a big deal and the neighborhood is quite safe. 蔜here don't appear to be any of those West Hollywood "boilerplate" street warnings that always result in a ticket. 蔄lthough, the gambler in me (or is it optimist) still makes an obligatory lap around that unbearable parking lot . . . just in case. �As for the food . . . GET THE NEWPORT (HOUSE SPECIAL) LOBSTER. 蔕therwise, its like going to Zankou Chicken and getting falafel. 蔜his place may have other dishes, and each time I add one to the obligatory lobster, but none of them stand out much . . . they're good, above average, but not enough to deal with the parking lot. 蔜he salt & pepper crab is good, the steamed whole fish tastes . . . well . . . like a steamed whole fish. 蔋onestly, its the one lobster dish that makes this place worth waiting outside (there is no room to wait inside). 蔜hey should take everything else off the menu and call it Lobster Nazi. 蔔o soup for you! �The Newport House Special Lobster is the best lobster dish I've had. 蔍 am not the biggest fan of lobster, but I like it and I really like crawfish (baby lobster), but this is so very tasty. 蔍've had lobster many ways (split-grilled Baja style, boiled, steamed, but this appears deep fried (or more likely pan-fried) with a spicy sauce and about a kilo of chopped green onions. 蔍 learned the rule to eating lobster is . . . there are no rules. 蔈njoy! 蔄nywhere there was some lobster flesh, I went at it. 蔜he tail was succulent. 蔜he claws, which I never really got into, slipped out like one of those silicone oven mitts . . . only much more edible. 蔜he (what are they, tentacles, antennae?) anyhow, I wanted to suck the marrow out of them . . . I did not have an instrument for it, so I improvised and shoved the sharper end of my chopsticks into them and pushed some meat out the other end . . . like a pixie stick filled with seafood crack! . . . nothing was wasted, it was too good . . . it is too good. �Toward the end of the meal, fatigue sets in, as does the salty sensation of MSG on your lips (yeah, there is a lot of that in [and on] these lobsters). 蔅ut its cool because you can head across the street to that Phoenix Inn place for their sweet soy tofu mango tapioca dessert thing in a cup, or head down Las Tunas westbound until it becomes Main and get some ice cream at the Cold Stone Creamery or grab a cup of coffee and stroll "downtown Alhambra". �They have cheap (i.e. 蕇crew off cap) white wine that goes pretty good with the MSG-laden lobster. �remember, cash only, no reservations . . . market price per pound, so your bill can add up

It's never too late to celebrate. 蔔ot too long ago, my good buddy and Yelp friend, Daniel L., surprised me with a late birthday celebration dinner at Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant. 蔜he late celebration is due, in part, to the fact that he lives north of the Los Angeles area. 蔔evertheless, the surprise dining experience at Newport was certainly worthwhile and I'm most appreciative. �As we walked in, we encountered the largest crabs I'd ever seen in my life, as they were swimming in a large tank. 蔜he gracious staff approached us and immediately escorted us to a table. 蔠e came here on a weeknight and it was quite crowded. 蔕ur waiter, who was very knowledgeable, came within minutes to take our order and was most suggestive. 蔇ining with Daniel, I knew we were bound to have a plethora of full-flavored dishes. 蔛o, we had everything from lobster, sizzling and savory meats, seasoned spinach, to large bowls of hearty soup. 蔔ever before had I dined with so much food on a table at a restaurant, as Newport gives very generous portions. 蔍n addition to our dining experience, the ambiance was most intriguing as well. 蔉rom the cloth-covered tables, which were mostly filled with families, to the Asian influenced d巆or, this restaurant certainly deserves its fame. 蔄lso, since we were stuffed from eating so much food, the curtain call to our meal was the well-liked boba drinks, which were quite refreshing, as they're made with real fruit. Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant has certainly proved their fierce devotion to serving quality food and creating a welcoming and family-oriented dining environment. 蔇ining in good restaurants, such as Newport, fails to get old. 蔍 certainly enjoyed my meal here and highly recommend this restaurant to all.

Chinese = Delicious. The food of course. After waiting a grueling 1 1/2 hours for my sister and her in-laws to arrive at the house we were effin starving. My sister decided to go over to their usual spot. I thought my sister was kidding when she had said she always came to Newport Tang Cang but to my surprise the owner and the waiters actually know her. Before even taking a look at the menu, I wanted to order what I've been craving for in ages; salted fish & chicken fried rice.... OMG... DroOOoOlz. When the waiter came, I immediately asked for it but to my disappointment they no longer had it in the menu. Why you ask? He told us because someone was actually psycho enough to sue them, the reason being because the people that ordered it expected the chicken and fish to be large pieces, not knowing it was all diced up and mixed, making it a Fried Rice. *sigh* I don't know if it's an Asian thing but we all know that it's all seasonings and pieces of chicken and fish just thrown in there. My world was crushed to find they didn't have what I've been craving for. :*(* But, not completely crushed because everything was down right good. We ordered: Mayonnaise Shrimps with Walnut, Salted Fried Pork Chops, Hot and Sour Soup, Fillet Fish with Basil, Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce, and the ever so delicious Newport Special Lobster. MmmMmmMmMM......... All in all, the meal was what we just needed. The service was just great. Our waiter was one of the funniest and best ones I ever had. And as we were about to leave the table, he said "Salamat!!!!!" ("Thank You" in Tagalog) My mission to get some Salted Fish and Chicken fried rice continues..............

Other than the super long wait, totally worth it!! Especially the house special lobster!! Yum! We had the black bean clams, it was pretty good! It is finger food, so it gets a bit messy! Must try the house special at least once (I've been here TWICE!) or you're definitely missing out! Their veggie plates were okay. The crab was good too!! Honestly, it's very hard to find a decent chinese seafood restaurant! The place is a bit on the pricier end, but that's what happens when you want good tasting seafood!

came here on Christmas day and as expected, the place is completely packed even at 6pm. there were at least 100 ppl waiting outside and we were lucky to get a table with an hour. the parking was pretty bad but we lucked out and found a space. there is a old guy as parking attendant security, he was kinda slow but still nice to have as someone double parked and blocked our car and he went and look for the guy. now, onto the food, we ordered a 4lb newport style lobster, chinese style beef cube, basil clams, walnut shrimp for the kids and a chinese brocolli type veggie. everything was good. the lobster is just heavenly, the taste is slightly vietnamese which is very distinctive to traditional chinese style lobster, and so is the basil clams. a nice variation to have basil instead of traditional chinese style with black bean sauce. the beef cube is good but can be slightly more tender, the veggie is excellent, the walnut shrimp was just normal but walnut shrimp can only be so good, the kids loves it. even my mom who is visiting from HK says that it is hard to find something this good in HK we were on our way to SD and specifically made the detour here for the food and it was completely worth it. the bill was not astronomical either, $16/lb for the lobster is very reasonable and all the dishes are generously sized.

When my brother asked where to meet 1/2 way (he is in Ventura, I in OC), I said 'Somewhere in San Gabriel/Monterey Park. 蔄lthough I did live in San Gabriel at one time (20 years ago for 2 years), I rarely am here anymore. 蔠ith so many restaurants around, I needed help from Yelp and Yelp didn't disappoint. �When I first got here around 1:30pm, there were a lot of people waiting inside and outside. 蔅ut luckily the first rush were wrapping up, in 15 minutes, we got our table for 9. �I have read up the reviews and took the advice and ordered the$108 Family Meal as followed: 1) 蔛eafood soup. 蔍t had squid, shrimp, fish cake, and fish balls cooked with nappa cabbage. 蔍t was light but the broth was surprisingly good. 2) 蔅lack Pepper Beef - cooked with onions and garnished with tomato and romaine lettuce. 蔍 didn't have any because I was not in the mood for beef, but it looked good and my fiance said it tasted good, too. 3) 蔏ung Pao Chicken - I really liked it. 蔜he chicken was not dry and had the right amount of saltiness and sweetness. 蔍t was not spicy like you expected Kung Pao to be. 4) 蔛teamed Whole Fish - This is pretty typical fish steamed and topped with shredded baby ginger, green onions, and soy sauce. �5) 蔛weet/Souce Pork Chop - The sauce is just right and the pork chop tender and not fatty. �6) 蔛alt and Pepper Crab and Shrimp - Both the shrimp and crab were cooked perfectly with the right amount of seasoning. 蔍 am so glad they were not overcooked or dry. 7) 蔊arlic stir fry peasprout. 蔍 usually don't care for this, but I really like it here. �There were so much food left that my brother and I split the left over to take home. 蔜he manager and servers were all very friendly and asked us how we liked the food and checked on us a few times to make sure we had what we needed (water, drinks, etc). 蔍 will definitely come again.

I have come to this restaurant many times and would have given it four stars rating before. 蔒y recent visit was really disappointing. 蔜he service was lousy. 蔜hey did not serve the soup first. 蔜he chicken cabbage wrap tasted like Thai food with Mexican flavor. 蔜he cabbage was small and not fresh. 蔠e could not even peel the cabbage leaves. 蔜he fried tofu was over-fried. 蔜he vegetable was too hard. 蔜he only thing good is lobster. 蔒y boss treated a couple guests and wanted to prolong the dinner, however, the restaurant seemed wanting to get us out of there in an hour. 蔜hey rushed all dishes in 20 minutes time. 蔜he restaurant was not busy at the time and probably only 1/3 蕂r less full.

I'm usually weary about Chinese cuisine made by Vietnamese, but this place is alright. Got there on a Saturday at 1115 am and there was already a line about 30 people deep. Doors opened promptly at 1130 and we were able to pick our own table. We sat in a semi - private room. And I use the word "semi" loosely. The food was doused with MSG and I had to deal with the after effects of dry mouth and headaches. But it was well worth it. We got the pre-fixed menu of $288, and it was tasty.

Overpriced and average food. We came here with great expectations based on yelpers but came out feeling underwhelmed and a bit ripped off. We asked for a small lobster for the 3 of us and learned that they consider small a 4.5 pound lobster at 77 dollars. When we asked why it was so big, the waiter said that people come here because they can afford to. Implying that they charge more because they can due to their reputation and established business. Also, a vegetable dish with no meat cost 17 bucks. In summary, if you want to pay a lot and get treated like crap, this may be your joint. As for a real foodie who cares about service and does not appreciate being ripped off, I will not be coming back.

first off - sorry for the horrible yellow tinge on the photos. 蔵 hate using flash and disturbing people but the drawback is sucky yellow pictures NTCSR is a busy, no-reservations, Chinese restaurant run by Viet-Chinese people who speak Cantonese. 蔍f you can understand the language, you might chuckle at the vulgar humor the wait staff directs at each other. 蔇on't be scurrred...they are polite to the patrons and they're great at refilling water, changing plates, and making room on the table. The way to enjoy NTCSR is eating with a large group and ordering the 238 Menu. 蔋ere's a few tips for dinner organizers: -The group size is best in multiples of 10 (here, we had 20 people) -Have someone arrive an hour early to put the group name down on the wait list. 蔜he wait is about 45 mins to an hour on a Sunday night if you want to eat at 7pm -Order a set dinner menu and have the waiter put the ticket in while you wait for the tables to be set up next to each other. 蔜his way, as soon as the group sits down, food can start arriving. We ordered two sets of the 238 Set (one for each round of 10) and there was plenty of leftovers. 蔜he numbers 2, 3, and 8 are homonyms of auspicious numbers in Cantonese. 蔒ost people ordering a set menu are celebrating a happy occasion so naming the menu in an auspicious way is how the Chinese people like it. It's also not a coincidence that the 238 set costs $238, base. 蔍 say base because they might sneak in a $32 charge for 2 extra pounds of lobster. 蔍s it worth it though? 蔣es. 蔜hey also put in 15% gratuity and the check is itemized clearly http://www.yelp.com/biz_� which makes it easy to divide the check. See pics for the exterior, the food, the menus and how big their crab and lobsters are. �http://www.yelp.com/biz_�蔜here are a ton of pictures up on the listing already so just click "Next" to scroll. Everything was delicious. 蔒y favorites were the lobster (so much roe) and crab, the peking pork chop, yang chow fried rice, the whole fish, and the kung pao medley. 蔜he clams were just OK and the sea cucumber was OK (expensive stuff though). �Our bill came out to about $35-$38 a head depending on if boba was ordered. 蔜heir bobas are $2.50 and they have a nice variety of flavors. 蔴ttp://www.yelp.com/biz_�蔍 got the soursop - haven't found this elsewhere yet. �My friend did a great job setting up his own birthday dinner. 蔔ext time, we'll fill every seat in the house and have him eat a crab this big all by himself http://www.yelp.com/biz_�and tell the waiters some dirty Cantonese jokes while he does it.

Good Lord, they know how to serve you or what??? Great food, great company of peeps, nice clean tables, always 110% service, I couldn't ask for more. Yes, I had to wait about 30mins to get my table, but I got 16 people in the group, so I wasn't bored waiting, can't deduct any star on that! Always the same row of order - Lobster (medium-sized), Filet Mignon Beef, Fried Tofu, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Tom Yaw (chinese veggies), Fish (this one, you have to ask the waiter of the kind of fish they have for the day, we picked one that can be cooked in 2 different way, Steamed and Fried, using just one fish). Since we had 16 people, we ordered double for everything cause we were splitted into 2 tables, older adult tables and youngsters' tables where you know I'd sit of course. I brought my aunts' families here last night, it's a first time for my cousin and they love it so much. All the food almost came out altogether, so you don't waste time filling your stomach while waiting for the rest of the food to come. Words to warn, never order Boba from here, it's not great, but always order Three Mixed Jelly, it's delicioso... and those of you who liked spikey fruit a.k.a Durian, they have a great Durian fruit juice!!! EEekk for me but not for everyone. Everything was so delicious, even with that many menus, almost every food was cleaned out, I mean seriously I was in shock myself cause the adult tables consists of itsy-bitsy eaters and the food was so good, it almost had no left over. I'm impressed. The server always checked up on us if we needed anything and if the food was great, also, since we came late for dinner like around 9, before the kitchen closed, the server asked if we needed anything before they stopped all the activities in the kitchen. �Yes, they have their own parking LOT, it's still not ENOUGH to contain all customers who came to the store, I had to park on the street, but who doesn't want to come here if the food are always consistently great. Hardly any flaws that I want to point out, never left here unsatisfied, so now I wonder if I should hold any UYE here, so I can show how great their food is with some other Yelpers... Hum.... =)

Likely the best Chinese restaurant I've been to. I am Chinese and grew up on Chinese food. Granted this is a Vietnamese-Chinese fusion. The lobster was pretty awesome as were most of the dishes. Sadly the one that I didn't care for was the crab; it was dry and overly fried. The lobster was stir fried in a nice pepper sauce, absolutely delicious. The other dishes I can remember is the french style beef, also stir fried in pepper. The steamed sole was to die for. The clams in the shell were amazing. The elephant clam was also delicious. The service is also amazing as the owner/manager (i'm guessing) doesn't even write down your order yet always gets it right. The decor is really nice for a Chinese restaurant. Get here early or you'll be waiting an hour+. We had dinner at 4:30pm believe it or not. By 6:00, the entire lobby was packed, a bit of a fire hazard if you ask me. The only reason why they didn't earn 5 stars is that their restroom was not so clean. What made it worse was that the sheet which the employees are to sign when they clean the bathroom each hour was filled out all the way through 9pm... remember, we were there at 4:30pm....

The price range is deceptive as this restaurant specializes in their lobsters and they can get mighty pricey depending on the weight. I believe the smallest one you can get is 3 lbs. Also, patrons come here for the crab that is seasonal. Their portions are large and generally meant to be shared and served among a group of at least four people.

Just when I thought this place couldn't possibly irritate me more, they find a new way. 蔍 really resent the blatant lie written by the owner on my review. 蔈xcuse me, but I think I would have noticed if I received a void receipt during dinner. 蔄nd also, I did not find out that they had charged me twice until the next day when I checked my CC account. 蔄ND it was the CC company who reversed the charges, NOT the restaurant. 蔄ND not once did I get an apology from the owner, but instead I got a lie and a request to update my review. 蔍 understand that you're running a business, but you have to take ownership if you guys make a mistake instead of asking customers to not express their experience at your restaurant. 蔛o here you go, Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant, here is your update.

Newport Tan Cang Seafood will make you rethink how lobster should be served at other places. Last week I attended a Pleasure Palate event hosted by Cecilia. I saw all the positive reviews on Yelp and realized that if I didn't go then, it would be a long time before I would visit this place on my own since its best to visit this type of restaurant in a group. The restaurant said that it gets crowded and wanted us to be there by 6:30 PM, even though our reservation wasn't until 7 PM. However, when we arrived, the place was almost empty. Empty enough, that the servers suggested that our party of 10 take up seating in one of their private rooms. We took them up on their offer. We were also told that all their 6 chefs were present that evening, and they encouraged us to order as many house specials as we can to take advantage of each chef's specialty dish. I was a little irked at having to rush there from the West LA, after seeing all those empty tables, but the clean and modern decor pacified me. I could tell from my other foodie friends that we weren't expecting the place to look so nice. The pics taken and posted by other Yelpers don't do justice in capturing the ambiance of the place. Someone in our group was gracious enough to bring a bottle of wine. the corkage fee is $10. I think 2 people in our party ordered Tsing Tao beverages which cost $3.25 each. I didn't try the wine or the Tsing Taos, so have no comment on them. They start off the dinner with a plate of complimentary fried cashews and peanuts. It was very greasy and rather unsatisfying. Good thing that appetizer was not indicative of the rest of the courses. The first dish to come was the crab and fishmaw special soup ($18.95). It resembles congee, but is since it has egg whites, its very similar to your run of the mill egg flower soup. You could taste crab and the even feel the cartilage like texture of the fish maw, but the soup was a bit on the bland side. You'll probably find yourself adding sauces and spices to it like my dinner companions did. The next dish we ordered was the Newport Lobster �$15.95 per lb, so total was $75.76) - their signature dish. Definitely a different way to prepare lobster compared to American/European style establishment. Rather than broiled and served without the head, this lobster is fried in a garlic based sauce and served chop up with the head included. The lobster definitely is packed with seasoning and spices that make it a very different type of lobster most people are used to with the typical lemon butter preparation. I grabbed the head because I love the lobster guts and fat, but noticed it was mostly empty of its contents. I was wondering where all the good stuff was, and I noticed my dining companions digging in to the the vegetables that served as a garnish the lobster was placed on. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the lobster guts and fat were mixed in. I took a bite of the veggie mix and it was delicious. Needless to say, we gobbled up all the veggie 'garnishment'. The next course that arrived was the Black Seatrout ($12 per lb, total was $39). The fish looked like it was sculpted. It was covered with a sweet and sour like sauce. I loved the crispiness texture of the skin, but the the meat was very mushy. 蔍 liked the dish, but wish that the flesh was more firm in texture. After the fish, we had the Spicy Clams ($10.95). I was a bit surprised by how large the manila clams were. They normally aren't served that large because as they get larger, clams become more tough and chewy. This was the case with this dish. It had a nice lobster like sauce with a hint of ginger, but the sauce wasn't enough to makeup for the chewiness of the clam meat. The next dish we had was their LocLac French beef ($11.95) . This dish really caught me by surprise - it was very tender and almost had a slight gamy taste to it like venison. Absolutely a stand out dish that should be always be ordered. The next dish we ordered was the Kong Pao Chicken. I wasn't impressed by this dish. It was boring and bland compared to the other seafood and meet dishes that we ordered. Its a 'safe' dish to order for those with less adventurous palates. Following the chicken, was Vege Deluxe, which was mostly bok choy with some baby corn and typical veggies you see in most stir fry dishes. It was fine for what it was, but nothing I would describe as exceptional. The final dish that we ordered was the Salt and Pepper Pork Chop ($9.95). It was greasy and overcooked and definitely on the salty side. I can prepare better pork chops myself at home. A side order of white rice for 10 people cost $5.00. Overall, I enjoyed the lobster, fish, and LocLac beef dishes and would order them again when I eventually return. Instead of the lobster, I would recommend trying the either the rock or Dungeness crab instead, since they would be a lot more affordable than lobster. The restaurant has a large parking lot.

I'm sorry to ruin your rating, but honestly I'm not a fan. Waited almost 2 hours for the table and we were skipped. I urged the owner to invest in some better speaker system for the queuing. I barely hear anything when the number was called and I was sitting inside the restaurant lobby. The food was ok. Nothing to the wow factor...nothing to the meh factor. I'm a picky eater and I don't like my food too salty and too oily. The food here definitely has Thai influenced. �I would recommend this place for big family.

Great place and great food. The lobster is a must get as well, also the live shrimp that comes around every season is something that must be experienced. They are also known for their cambodian style clams and french beef so do not forget to order that. : ) Downside is that they usually do not take reservations and the wait can be anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours. It is usually packed on the weekends therefore go early!

we had the house special lobster and the ginger crab and some kind of beef. i really liked all three dishes but i think the beef was my fave but i think the sauce overall in all three dishes were a bit too salty so steamed rice on the side is a must! initially i was going to give this place 3 stars because although the food was good, it was so dang hard to eat!!! especially the crab. i think i spent more time trying to get the meat out than actually eating. the extra star is for the watermelon slush. it's so good that it deserves its own star. they use real fruit (and some sugar) and it's SO GOOD! i had two tonight :P very crowded so make reservations especially if your party is big and there may not be parking (like today) and you may have to street park.

Lobster! I'm not Chinese so I've never had Lobster any other way except plain and boiled. And honestly I've given up lobster because I'm allergic. But I remember about a year ago when I decided to just f it and just try it. I was truly amazed. The whole lobster comes out looking magnificent on a huge platter battered and covered in fresh herbs peppers and a sauce. �I wish i remembered how it tasted). You're always getting a good deal here, no matter what. We ordered once of those suggested planned menus once and spent less than $100 on all this food. Plates were beginning to be stacked up on top of each other. But we also always over-oder, because someone wants chow fun and then someone wants chicken, and then someone wants the fish. . . . You get the gist. You can't come here without ordering seafood or the lobster. Just because I'm allergic doesn't mean the whole table shouldn't have any. And I've brought large parties here, and everyone always comes out happy (and mad that they had to eat that much. Hey i didn't force them too). The 蕇ervice is still very upfront., "pick one" the waiter tells me as I'm trying to pick a BOBA drink. I also love getting their whole fresh young coconut to drink. But the owner, is very helpful. Last weekend, we went with the waiter's suggestion of ordering their STURGEON which will come out prepared three ways (deboned too!)...soup, steamed, and fried but my favorite was the fried! It is battered then drenched in a 蕇auce that had sweet chilli sauce and basil. I basically love everything on the menu, even the more famous Chinese dishes are well executed, but go for their Vietnamese inspired dishes..where herbs like mint and basil are used.

I love love love this restaurants. The manager knows me already and says hello everytime I go. Their service super fast and all their food is delicious. I like their pork chops, catfish and lobster. The only complaint I have is their not accustomed to serving water. I can't eat that much food and down it with just hot tea. Dinner time gets super busy. I suggest you go during lunch around 1 or 2 because of their lunch specials. Big portions and cheap. This is by far my favorite place to eat.

this restaurant was easily the provider of one of the most noisy eating environments i have been to in my lifetime. 1. french beef - soft, tender and moist beef smothered with liquidy gooey sauce and came with lime and tomatoes, very good for the carnivore in us all. 2. lobster house special- apparently all they had were "4 pounds" tonight, so we had one but it didnt seem like 4 pounds more like 2 MAX, maybe they weighed the dish. anyway, it was pretty decent. green onions and pepper, christmas colors if you include the massive plate. 3. pan fried noodles with chicken- very tasty, ran out of noodles however. would have liked to have seen more of the greens on the bok choy instead of the bottom part. add the imitation sriracha and youve got a party in your mouth baby! 4. chinese brocolli - my mom said this was "excellent" and they did a "very good job" cooking it. i thought it tasted ok, but i like spinach like popeye instead, yet not in a can as there is christmas in a can 5. mabo tofu - very basic, from what i recollect - tofu, mushrooms and some tiny bits of pork - about the equivalent of 1 Tbps of bacon bits. tasted great with the perfect consistency sauce +++ 6. steamed sea trout - was this even real? it melts in your mouth like creamed polenta. 蔭nd this was the ugliest fish ever, it had evil white eyes and small creepy baby teeth. put a clown mask over it and your set, or a kermit the frog mask haha would come back with ear plugs, so - 1 star. service was cracked out. so -1 star . otherwise excellent food. and if youre coming here dress warm since it was colder inside than it was outside.... 1/2/10

Despite my previous review, we decided to lunch here on a Wednesday afternoon off peak. 蔠e haven't been to their new location since their move. 蔇on't know if they build from the ground up but I suspect that they remodeled a previous establishment. �The layout is not typical Chinese but the semi-private rooms on the way to the bathroom is probably a Chinese addition. 蔅efore I move on to the food, I would just like to report, they now take plastic and I did not detect B.O. in the restaurant at all (the waiter was serving over my shoulder). We ordered the house special lobster (4.5 lbs?), kung pao squid, basil fish filet, seafood fried noodles, salt pepper pork chop, and Chinese broccoli garlic stir fry. �Now I've been eating Chinese food since i was little and would consider myself hard to impress at this stage of my life. 蔠hen I took that first bite of kung pao squid, I made eye contact with my wife and we both gave a "wow". 蔍t has that perfect blend of wok seared roastiness and tangy kung pao sauce. 蔍'm sad that it was so good, because the next time I have kung pao elsewhere, it will remind me of Newport's. 蔏inda of like eating Shao Long Bao elsewhere after having Ding Tai Fun's, why bother, you're just setting yourself up for disappoint. 蔜he fish filet came next, it was breaded drenched in starchy sauce, so a little soggy. 蔉lavor was good but not good enough to order next time. 蔛alt/pepper pork chop was next, thin cuts, not heavily breaded, one of the best. 蔄lot of Cantonese places cut the chops too thick or over fried. 蔔ewport's flavor was delicate, it taste like they actually cared about the food, hard to describe, but not many Chinese restaurants have this trait since most Chinese food is heavily seasoned to cover up the lack of quality. �The broccoli was next, we were able to order off menu, instead of boiled Chinese broccoli we have it garlic stir fried. 蔆risp and garlicky... 蔳oes great with rice (pour the juice over the rice). 蔛eafood noodle came next. 蔜his is the "two side yellow" version. 蔄gain we were surprised by this, a very typical Cantonese dish. 蔒ost places drench the noodles in sauce, making it soggy within seconds. 蔔ewport's version, the sauce is more centered.. making it crispy noodles surrounding the gravy in the middle. 蔒agnificent. 蔄nother trait with Chinese food is that the leftovers are usually pretty nasty the next day. 蔜hat's when you notice the sub-par ingredients they use in their food. 蔜he noodles we couldn't finish so we had to go. 蔈ver heat up leftover Chinese seafood? 蔆ats would come running all over the neighborhood. 蔒y co-workers banned me from using the microwave ever again. �But Newport's seafood noodle was still excellent. 蔍 didn't even have to add soy sauce or rooster sauce, it was still delicious. 蔔ow the lobster that everyone raves about is something that everything should still rave about. 蔜here house special flavor is not heavy nor over buttery like other places. 蔍t was even a little spicy. 蔇efinitely a dish to impress the in-laws at $16/lb. 蔕ur lobster was about $67. �My only gripe now with Newport is that it is still too far away from us. 蔅ut it is a drive worth doing just for the kung pao.

This place has a reputation. An excellent one. In fact, the #1 top-rated restaurant in SGV on yelp. That's pretty impressive and to be honest, four hours ago, I thought I'd be coming home and contributing to the 200+ reviews with my own positive one. Not anymore. Tonight was my first time here and probably last. Here's why: The bf and I came here tonight (Sunday night), arrived around 7:30pm, and I went in to get a number while the bf parked. I was told the wait would be 15 minutes for the two of us. I was starving, but I really wanted to try this place, and it has been highly recommended not only by my co-worker but seemingly by the yelp community, so 15 minutes seemed fine. And damn, not only did the entire restaurant smell of delicious seafood, I saw the HUGE lobsters in the tanks at the front of the restaurant and I couldn't resist. We sit, we wait. ...15 minutes later, we're still waiting. We were finally seated after waiting for half an hour. Mind you, I really wasn't irritated by the wait at all. I was more excited to try the food than anything. It's not until I'm looking back on it now that I'm a little annoyed that the wait was longer than they said. Anyways, so we sit, look at the menu, and since it's just the two of us, were a little hesitant to get the lobster. When the waiter came to take our order, I asked him how much the lobster is (since the menu says "market price"). He says its $15.95/lb. I ask him how big the lobsters are. And he said, "The lobsters tonight are small. About 3.5 lbs." hmm, ok, 3.5 lbs seems reasonable for the two of us. So we order the house lobster and the basil fish fillets. My mouth starts salivating as I think about the delicious lobster I am about to devour. The food was delicious. The fish was flavorful, tasted fresh, and the lobster was so good I was licking my fingers like no other. YUMMY. I have to admit that the lobster got kind of salty towards the end, but that definitely didn't take away from any of the spectacular-ness of the food. Besides, that's what the rice is for. The garlic and onions that garnished the lobster went perfectly with the rice too. The food, no doubt, was excellent. Now I see why this place is the #1 top-rated restaurant in SGV on yelp. Service was great, the waiters kept swapping plates for us (because they were piled with lobster shell), and refilling our waters. That doesn't happen too often in a Chinese restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised with that. The restaurant itself was also quite pleasant, and looked pretty nicely decorated for a Chinese place. (Maybe I'm just used to eating in dingy hole-in-the-walls). The food, of course was good. That part I already made clear and even the damn complimentary oranges they gave us in the end were sweet and juicy. I was pretty satisfied with our meal at that point. So why the 2 stars? ...that's until we got the bill... which had a fat $110 on it. My eyeballs almost fell out. Really? $110 for two people? And then I see they charged us for 5.5 lbs of lobster... two pounds more than the waiter told us it'd be. Let's see... two pounds at $15.95... That's $32 more than what we thought we'd be paying for! I was contemplating just paying for the damn thing, esp. since the food was so good, but damn, I felt a little played. They explained that they probably ran out of the smaller ones, but the other waiter said they only had smaller ones that night! Seriously, even if they ran out of smaller ones, shouldn't they at least inform us and ask us if we still wanted it? We specifically requested a smaller one because there were only two of us. We did not want a freaking 5.5 lbs lobster! To me, it seemed like the waiter just gave us a bullshit weight for the lobster just so we'd order it, and then charge us later on and hoping we'd just pay for it! Not happening. so I tell one of the waiters (not the one we ordered from) that we were told the lobsters were going to be 3.5 lbs. he says, "all our lobsters are more than 3 lbs." and I repeat, "yes, we were told we were getting one that is 3.5 lbs because its just the two of us." so he talks to some other waiter, asks me which waiter I ordered from, blah. After getting what seemed like all the waiters involved, they finally changed our bill and charged us for a 4-lb lobster. And he actually said, "ok, I took 1.5 lbs off your bill... are you satisfied?" i almost laughed. As if I was unreasonable to want to pay what I thought I was getting! The revised bill was $84, and I just gave $95 total with tip. I almost didn't give a tip, but I guess a part of me was at least thankful they revised my bill. So there you have it. The food is not overrated. I can tell you that. The food is definitely good. But when I go to a restaurant, I care about the entire experience, not just the food. Sad that a place with such great food and good business had to use such horrible sales tactics to get people to order the expensive stuff. Guess the economy is getting to them.

This is some of the best Chinese food I know of. I've been here three times, and ordered nearly the same thing each time. This is one of those restaurants that has a wall lined with giant tanks of live seafood, all awaiting their eventual death and consumption by hungry patrons. It's almost PETA's worst nightmare, which is awesome. Notable among the inmates are the huge tanks of crab, lobsters and, oddly, elephant clams (yeah, weird). I've ordered the House Special Crab from here and it's pretty good. Lots of chili, lime, and ginger. However, it's really difficult to eat and there isn't much meat- next time I will definitely try the House Special Lobster. I also have ordered both the House Special Fish (not my favorite) and whole fish in black been sauce (AWESOME). I highly recommend the latter. One thing that I will say stands out above many seafood dishes I've had, anywhere, is their Salt and Pepper Squid. YOU NEED TO ORDER THIS. It is by far one of the crispiest, lightest, most flavorful, most pleasing calamari dishes to be had ANYWHERE. Things to note: The staff has Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese and English speakers, in case you have relatives in from out of town. The restaurant itself also only takes cash.

This review is for customer service only. We came to this restaurant around 4:30 pm to avoid the crowded parking lot. The restaurant was deserted. I even wondered whether they are open. We sat down, the waiter brought one menu even though there were two of us. After I have asked for another menu, the waiter let us wait at least ten minutes while nonchalantly leaning against a counter and staring outside through a window appearing utterly bored. We tried to wave him down but he chose to completely ignore us. In the meantime, the manager and a few other waiters were replacing old ceiling lights around us. We tried to get attention from them as well but everyone appeared to be too busy with the lights that they forgot they even have customers. A group of five Asian women sat down, were promptly helped by an attentive waiter and in a few minutes their meals started to arrive while we were still sitting at a table wondering whether it is the fact that we are not Asian or whether we were actually invisible that our orders were not even taken let alone getting some food. When I got up and asked for the manager and explained the whole situation, the manager started to apologize profusely and took our order. Following that, a waiter began to throw ladles into ceramic bowls around where we were sitting while looking at us to see if we'd be annoyed by the loud noise that his whole performance was producing. After that, another waiter was walking by while singing loudly and looking at us with a mocking smile. I wanted to leave but my husband pointed out that we already ordered our food and it wouldn't be fair to the restaurant. Let's just say that it was his birthday and I wanted to treat him to the great lobster and crab that majority of Yelpers were raving about, but it turned into the most humiliating dining experience that I ever had. Thank you, Newport Tan for ruining my husband's birthday though he was gracious enough not to mention it at all.

I love the clams with basil here and the fried tofu! Used to come here often when I was in college but haven't been able to make it out here in awhile. The restaurant is always crowded but luckily my friend's aunt owns the place (not sure if she still does) so we got hooked up! I've tried just about everything and there wasn't anything that I didn't really like (except the abalone). The french beef is flavorful and very tender! The fried tofu is delicious when you dip it in the soy sauce. The clams with basil is my ultimate favorite. I was never a fan of clams until I came here! I just wish this restaurant was closer to my house!

Exceptional. 蔄bsolutely exceptional. 蔍 must say, after going here twice now, this might be one of the best all around restaurants I have been to in Los Angeles. �My parents first heard about this place through West Ways, which is a free monthly magazine for AAA members. 蔜here was a little article about this Chinese/Vietnamese seafood place and based on that we went. �The food: 蔍ncredible. 蔛imply top notch in every way possible. 蔍'll start with the crown jewel: 蕋he lobster. 蔄h, the lobster. 蔄sian cultures seem to do some damn amazing things with shellfish. 蔜his is the total opposite of how you might be used to getting lobster served. 蔔o half shell, served with drawn butter. 蔠hile good, that has nothing on what the team of Newport Tan Cang Seafood have done. 蔖erfectly spiced to your specifications with peppers, seasoning, garlic and onion, the platter of lobster comes served to in a glorious pile of lobster pieces. 蔍t looks like a lobster stepped on a grenade and landed perfectly cracked and seasoned on your plate. 蔍t's a beautiful thing. 蔍t's very easy to get all the meat out of the lobster with no hassle whatsoever. 蔍've eaten amazing food all over the world, so I can't believe I'm writing this, but House Special Lobster (medium spicy) might be one of the greatest things I have ever eaten. 蔋UZZAH! Other dishes: 蔋ouse Special Crab: Served same style as lobster. 蔛till very good, though not as meaty or rich as the lobster. 蔍f you love crab though, you will not be disappointed. ����������蔆rispy Duck: 蔕h Jesus was this amazing as well. 蔍 love duck. 蔜his was the best duck I've ever had. 蔍t was fried obviously, but wasn't remotely greasy. 蔋ow they managed to fry such a rich bird as a duck and not have any grease left behind is beyond me. 蔣ou could literally suck the meat off the bone and it practically dissolves in your mouth. 蔎ust incredibly decadent. A+ ����������蔣am Leaves: 蔔ot on the menu as they are seasonal. 蔞ery similar to spinach, delicious and perfect prepared, cooked in huge chunks of garlic. 蔇elicious ����������蔋ouse Noodle Seafood: 蔄 huge portion of perfectly cooked noodles with heaping portions of seafood. 蔆ould have used a bit more spice to be totally honest but still awesome all the way. The menu is beautiful, a hearty collection of various Chinese, Cambodian, Vietnamese cuisine. 蔛ome of it will look familiar, some will be foreign. 蔍 can't wait to go back and try all new items. 蔖lus 1 for having chicken feet, which I have not seen in LA outside of a few Dim Sum places. They also have a wide selection of milk teas, slushes, boba..all that good stuff (Though I can't imagine anyone wanting boba with all the insanely good food they are about to eat) Price: 蔜he lobster will run you $16/lb. 蔊ood luck finding a lobster under 4 pounds. 蔜here are some massive monsters in the tanks. 蔠orth every penny. 蔆rab ran a few dollars less. 蔈verything else was comparable to your neighborhood Chinese restaurant, an incredible deal considering the quality, freshness and portions of the food. 蔐et's say around 9-14 a plate, on average. A steal. They also have a large lunch special menu with insanely good deals around 7 bucks. Service: 蔄gain, top of the line all the way. 蔠ater was always refilled, fresh dishes and napkins always brought over. 蔉riendly waiters always willing to answer any questions. 蔒anager was very warm and friendly and the young woman working the register/hostess area was super cute! Decor: 蔙eally nice. 蔆asual enough to stroll in with shorts, nice enough to make a really good dinner date. 蔜he place has two main areas, a main dining room area which is 蔯lean and simple with some art on the wall and bottles of wine on a rack. 蔜he back area is really cool. Bit more privacy and some really attractive wooden dividers. Keep in mind they get crazy busy around dinner. 蔠e came at 4:30 and were served right away. 蔉irst time we came around 6 and waited nearly an hour. Did I mention it comes with non bitter tea, fresh made rice, and delicious oranges at the end? 蔍 don't know why everything tasted so much damn better here than any place else. 蔄nd no, I don't work here in case you think I'm some sort of plant (Though I happily would be, if they paid me in crispy duck) I will shut up now. 蔎ust go. 蔍f the cost was double and the restaurant was in a dirty garage in Compton it would still more than warrant 4 stars. 蔜he fact that it's not makes Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant 蕎orth an easy 5 stars +

Drum roll, please. WOW!!! Today I rectified my mistake of years---avoiding this place due to the amount of surface street driving needed to reach it. I do believe I've just eaten the 3rd best Chinese meal of my life. #1? At the home of Mrs. Lee back in England. #2? At a restaurant Mrs. Lee took us to in London, a place buried in the back alleys of the city, amongst the soot covered building walls, harking back to the late 1800s and Sherlock Holmes ... an area where one thought a few opium dens should be open, a place where a non-Asian was an oddity and no English is seen on a menu. Sunday, 12:40 p.m. ... only had to wait 10--15 minutes to get seated, studied the menu in the meantime. The lunch special menu offered a lot of variety, all in the $5.75--$6.75 range. You could eat here on the cheap if you wanted to. However, looking around, I saw many tables ordering the dinner menu house specialty items, so "cheap" wasn't in their plans. On arrival I counted one Hispanic and one Caucasian, so figured I'd come to the right place. As to the seating, it's mostly large family-style tables, and couples are in the minority and get seated at the few booths along the street-side windows. (P.S.: my spouse commented on how comfortable the booth was.) They took one look at him and brought forks to the table ... me, I'm chopsticks all the way :) The Food: (1) Ordered the Shrimp w/ Garlic Sauce (mild please), $6.25 on the lunch menu. In most restaurants this would have been considered very good, but our other items were so outstanding that this one paled into insignificance. (2) Peking Style Pork Chop, $5.75 on the lunch menu. Fantastic, delicious, a rich tomato and onion sauce on succulent pork. Order it!!! (3) Beef Loc Lac, French Style, $11.95 on the dinner menu. Small cubes of beef so tender and juicy that they almost melted in the mouth, in a yummy sauce. This is a favorite of patrons and during the week they make 100 servings of it a day. Order it!!! (4) Newport House Special Lobster at a "seasonal" price (mild on the spiciness, please). The lunch came to $88 for the two of us, before tip, so you work out the market lobster price. Was it worth it? Yeah!!!! You can order it in S, M, or L size. Our waiter said to go with the small and he was right as it was still about 4 lbs of lobster cut up and served (the large is usually about 8--10 lbs of lobster). I admit it ... we got our fingers into it, made a mess, used a chop stick to push out bits of lobster meat, sucked the whole mass clean, dropped food on the front of our clothes, and considered ourselves lucky to try a dish that was so incredibly outstanding. In looking around the restaurant while waiting for our food to arrive, we noticed many of the tables had this lobster item, no surprise. Order it!!! You'll note above that we said "easy/mild" on the spicy heat level ... that was because we looked around and saw quite a few diners mopping the sweat off their brow, so knew the restaurant was serious on the heat factor if that's what you want. In a happy long-term relationship, each person has certain "roles" ... one of mine is to locate new great restaurants for my husband to try. I messed up Friday and Saturday and he almost lost faith in my ability to find a good meal for him. I told him to trust me, he wouldn't, so I had to bribe him to try this place, saying that I'd pay for it from the emergency cash stash in my wallet instead of putting it on our shared credit card. He agreed it was a really great dining experience --- but the twerp still made me pay :)

5 star lunch menu!!! 蔍t's got the same items on the dinner menu except the prices are significantly cheaper. 蔜his place is solid and you'll get really good food. 蔍t's a keeper and I'll definitely be returning. 蔠e had the salted pepper shrimp, beef loc lac, deep fried sweet and hot fish, pea sprouts, basil clams and the kung pao chicken. 蔄ll the aforementioned were great except the basil clams weren't cooked right at all and the kung pao was just so so. 蔕therwise, stick to the yelpers' reviews. 蔣ou'll go happy ordering almost anything. 蔋owever, if I was to come back here again I probably wouldn't order the fish again. 蔍t was ridiculously overpriced. 蔍'm thinking everything else on the menu is miraculously cheaper because the gouge you at the fish tank.

We used to like this place a lot, but the quality of the food has gotten worse. Please make sure to ask them how many lbs your lobster is. We asked for a small size lobster and they mentioned that it would be from 3-4 lbs. When it came out, we thought it was a little small to be 4 lbs so at most this lobster would only be 3.5 lbs. When we got the bill, it stated the lobster was 4.5 lbs. Hell, that's a tiny lobster with no meat in the claws. @ $15.99 a lbs! What a rip-off! Sadly, we will not return here esp with so many other seafood places around here.

lobster time again! however, the lobster let me down a little this time...it's still good, just that i always hav too high expectation for this place. order a 6 lb lobster and seems like we didn't get too much meat out of it. maybe it shrunk a little since some pieces tasted a little burnt, the more you cook, the more it shrinks. hmm. at least the taste's still good, so not complaining much. i tried 2 new dishes thou, on top of the lobster and the $28 combo. it was the baked bean curd w/ salt and pepper and chicken krapron. the fried bean curd was okie, it's pretty tasteless if you eat it alone. you need to dip it in the salt and lime juice that they give you, or the chili fish sauce if you like. the chicken krapron is basically minced chicken lettuce wrap. it's minced chicken, shrimp, and basil stir fried served with lettuce. surprisingly a very good and flavorful dish, besides that the lettuce they served was not cut into a round bowl shape.... it's just a whole lettuce, cut in half, and here it goes on ur plate. so at the end, maybe you'll need to use those wrinkly pieces from the middle part to try to make ur lettuce wrap. good luck.

I have been going to Newport for 20 years. The quality is going down. The House Special Lobster is not the same like that of in the past. Bo Loc Lac is still the BEST. Do not order dishes that are not that specialty such as duck, chicken lettuce etc, you will be VERY disappointed. Excellent service, but I come for the house special lobster or crab...

I still cannot believe that my bf and I finished a 5 lbs lobster together, also a side of fried rice. 蔠e were stuffed, and both of us left the restaurant with a huge smile and big belly. �Check out the picture I post here!) When I was planning our small trip to LA, I told my bf that there's one restaurant that I must go, so the first day when we arrived, we went straight to Newport Seafood Restaurant for our first lunch meal. �As usual I ordered the house special lobster, and I asked them to pick a smaller female lobster with eggs....we were both stunned when the waiter placed the lobster on our table, but quickly, we finished the whole lobster!! �I think the people next to us were shocked how fast we finished the whole thing on our own. 蔜he lobster itself was about $80...we both couldn't believe how cheap our bill was. 蔍 didn't like the fried rice, but we need some rice to eat with the lobster. 蔜he lobster is chopped, fried in crisp, and quickly stir-fried with black bean sauce, sugar, salt, soy sauce, spices, chili peppers, green onions, gingers, & garlics. 蔛ounds easy? 蔔ot really, I still can't find any restaurants up in the Bay Area can cook as good as Newport Seafood Restaurant. 蔅ring enough $$, because it's cash only, and the nearby ATM is about a block away.

YELP! I've been buried under piles of proposal folders and meeting agendas that I've neglected my once daily routine of checking what's new on YELP. I LOVE THIS PLACE. ok. I've only been here twice, and I don't remember the first time, so let's just say once. The lobster is absolutely A-MAZING and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like lobster or any other shell fish. I hate working for my food, and thatis often the case with Seafood so I usualy abstain when possible. 蔠e came here after a grueling 3 hour FIDM graduation at Staples Center (the most blow-out graduation I've ever seen), and I'm so glad we did because we didnt' have to wait long for the food to come out! Thank you Carrie's family for discovering this place over 20 YEARS AGO. Consistency is obviously the key to a successful restaurant and Newport has got it down to a science. Must get the LOBSTER, don't let it scare you, the meat easily falls out of the shell, I didn't have to get down and dirty to get the fleashy goodness. And the eggs? I wasn't hard core enough to try it, but everyone else certainly was. We also had the Kung pao chicken which was absolutely above average, and they had this fried fish in some kind of sauce with I want to say it was basil. DELICIOUS, next time I'm getting that for sure. If I ever crave seafood, I will drive 45-1hr. minutes to get here.

All right, I don't need to elaborate that their lobster is absolutely heavenly, but I would like to emphasize how good the other food is and what else is so good about this restaurant. FOOD FAVORITES: - This place fulfills my lobster fantasies. I hate the way American people do lobster--boiled with butter dipping sauce? GROSS! But the Chinese, they really know how to do it! And Newport is definitely the best at it! Yeah it's pricey, but that's lobster for you. - Deep fried fish with spicy fish sauce. Yummmm, so good. I think I could eat a whole fish just by myself!!! The fish is really crispy on the outside and it's easy to pull the meat off the skeleton, but what REALLY makes this dish good is the sauce!!! I wish my parents knew how to make it that way.. It's sweet, spicy, and salty all at the same time. So perfect! - Clams with basil sauce. Again, the sauce totally makes this dish. The first few times we ate this, the clams were somewhat small, but lately, they've been big, so I guess it varies? One of my favorites, although China Bistro also makes them just about as good. - Their kung pao chicken is different from any other Chinese place I've ever had it and in a good way. I'm a really big fan of kung pao chicken for some reason and I'm starting to think this is becoming my favorite version! I really can't describe how their chicken is different... It's not super saucy like some other places and it's kind of crispy... Maybe there's a photo in the gallery that will help you understand what I mean... - Their yang chow fried rice is also super delicious! The only thing I have to complain about is that the dish given is kind of small in comparison to other Chinese places... - Salt and pepper shrimp! Super crispy and salty! YUMMMM. There are a lot of other really good dishes here, but those are my top choices! SERVICE: This place has the BEST service among any other Chinese restaurant I have ever gone to. They are very attentive and very friendly! Food comes fast and everything you ask for actually comes. ATMOSPHERE: The decoration in this place is really pretty and well-done, which is not something you can expect from every Chinese restaurant these days. It's very modern and clean. I love it! And it doesn't seem quite as loud as other Chinese restaurants. There's also a nice area in the back for big groups--very nicely decorated and private. OTHER NOTES: - I really don't know why the information for this restaurant says they don't accept credit card because THEY DO. My dad just paid with his card today at lunch! - Since it's so busy, parking can be hard to find, but the lot is by no means small. - Lunch special is definitely a bargain with all the dishes around $5 each, but dinner is probably around twice as expensive, although I think the portions are slightly larger. - They always give a complimentary bowl of sweet and spicy soup for each person to start off with, but I don't really like it... Overall, I definitely recommend this place. It's my FAVORITE Chinese restaurant!!!

I have been a longtime fan of Cantonese-style lobster, and this place offers one of the best I've ever tried. 蔇iners at almost every table order big lobsters and are having a blast. 蔜he house special lobster is the way to go, but if you don't want it spicy, they will leave out the jalapenos and black pepper. 蔜he fish is nothing special, but some of the other traditional dishes are also commendable. 蔄 very clean joint where the service is much better than what you typically expect at a Chinese restaurant.

I came here with my family for lunch on Sunday. The food is good. The prices are reasonable. The service is decent. The servers speak English so it was easier for me to communicate.

Be for warned the iced tea here is to be avoided (even the waiters don't recommend it). Other than that the ambiance and overall taste was great. I give this place two thumbs up and one hip gyrate, eat here its good! (assuming its not busy)

One of the nicest restaurants Chinese restaurants I've been to in a while. 蔅y nicest I am only referring to the decor and cleanliness. 蔍t's the 3rd Chinese meal I've eaten in 18 hours. 蔄lso the 2nd meal at Newport Tan Cang in 18 hours, started off at the Colima branch 6pm last night. 蔛tarted off this morning with some nice appeitzers at Mandarin Noodle Deli (read my review for more details). 蔜his place is clearly not Chinese either - the writing is in Vietnamese. 蔜hey ran out of Diet Coke by noon. 蔜he parking lot is insanely crowded even though its huge. 蔜here are some really cool individual rooms to the right near the bathrooms. 蔠e're thinking of creating a reality food series called 3.5 Jews, a baby and dumplings. 蔍 don't know why I am writing stream of consciousness pseudo Chinese Vietnamese food reviews. Get these items and you will not be disappointed 1. Green onion and ginger lobster. 蔉antastic sauce. 蔣ou need to mix the roe and green onion sauce into rice. 蔍f you're a real pro you dump the entire thing of rice into the lobster dish and mix it up for proper distribution. 蔖eople have described at ad naseum that the lobster is expensive. 蔮lah blah blah if you know it's expensive and don't want to spend the money don't complain. 蔍 want 5 cashmere sweaters for the winter but I can't afford them so I don't own them. 2. French style beef luc lac. 蔍t's a very special order of beef. 蔋ard to tell what type of cut but it was very tender and flavorful. 蔒y gringo friends said it was some of the best beef they've ever had. 3. Salt n pepper crispy calamari. 蔄s advertised crispy, well deep fried and balanced nicely with lime, salt n pepper. 4. Kong pao chicken. 蔍 was hesitant to order but so many people raved about it. 蔊et this. 蔔ot greasy, not too many green onions and just a nice hint of spice. 蔎amie and I had some serious negotiations about who got these leftovers. 5. Pea shoots sauteed with garlic. 蔔ice, simple and if you're going to get greens this is a nice dish. 6. House special whole fish. 蔜hey have a few options. 蔄sk them what they have and how much per pound. 蔜he snapper and rock cod with the oil soy green onion sauce. 蔣um. Optional and not in the same class as aforementioned dishes 7. Clams in black bean sauce. 蔕k nothing to lose sleep over. 蔜he sauce is certainly elegant and fragrant. 蔜he clams were eh. 蔆an do without them. 8. Deep fried tofu. 蔜he tofu was crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside. 蔍t's a nice dish but kinda like being a reality show girl wannabe actress at the Victoria's Secret after party. 蔄fterthought. The food here is legit. 蔍t is also better when it's not your 2nd meal in an hour.

We tried this place because of all the positive yelp reviews, and it was almost 2:00 and hadn't had lunch yet. 蔠e found this place disappointing. First, be sure to check the plates and tea cups to make sure they are clean. 蔅oth my wife and I found our tea cups had some dried food in them. 蔠hen the told our waiter, he quickly gave us replacements snatched from another empty table, with no apologies. �Next came the free hot and sour soup, which tasted OK, but was thicker than the gravy for the mash potatoes at KFC, (they need to exercise some corn starch control), The good part is we didn't spend too much because they "lunch specials" priced around $7. 蔠e figured it we ordered the specials, they should be good a cooking them right? 蔒aybe after 2:00 they have the second string cooks cooking? �We ordered the Yang chow fried rice, clams with basil sauce, and baby pea pods in garlic sauce. 蔜he clams were good, but the pea pods were a over cooked and had a lot of burnt garlic. 蔜he worst dish was the fried rice, which smelled and looked like old over cooked rice. 蔍t was kind of like rice that was sitting out for a day of two and then fried with too much water added. 蔜he BBQ pork was a pretty low quality and not tasty. 蔜he only other ingredients were a little bit of over cooked scrambled egg, three shrimps, and chopped green onion. 蔠e ate about two fork fulls and left the rest. 蔜he booba was OK, about the same quality as you would get from tapioca express. 蔍 think if you eat here, stay with the expensive seafood dishes (lobster, crab, shrimp about $!3 to $15 per pound), skip the non seafood. �With all the great Chinese food places nearby, I would not go back hear again.

I just want to update my 5 stars with another 5 stars review. We came here with gramps and cousins from out of town. There are 10 of us. We got there around 11:30am-noon, and got seats right away. The service was excellent. The waiters were attentive especially to grandparents. One guy was walking around chatting up customers, I think is the manager, kept coming around asking us if everything is good, very friendly. The food was excellent. We got the usual stuff, lobsters, clams, fresh fish (a little small, but we got two portions), french beef, a few veggies, and a chicken and shrimp dish. I think we had total of 9 dishes. Everyone was stuffed and happy. Great service, great food, and the bill came down to be around ~$250 which was not bad at all for 10 people with a large size lobster. Highly recommended.

What can you say about this place, that hasn't been said already. One thing for sure their food is really good, very tasty and salty. The lobster is always great, however on my last trip we got a medium size and it was a dead one or a left over. I didnt want to complain about it since it was my sisters b-day and didnt want to cause a scene especially when we knew all the waiters. however i have been eating lobsters since i was 6 years old and you know when it is not fresh the meat sticks to the inner shell and the crab claws is dried up inside. Anyway i would normally give it a 5 star since the service is always great and the food is good, it was that one bad experience that shouldn't be there since this is a reputable place and we pay premium dollar for what we order. Anyway give it a try and hopefully you will not be disappointed.

The new place is much bigger and nicer, but still packed on a Sunday night. Very flavorful lobster. We spent $70 for our medium lobster for 5. Well there are other Chinese places that we can get it cheaper, maybe half the price, but not as tasty. Their regular dishes were OK. I guess next time we'll just order their specialties only. By the way, they take credit cards now. No more cash only.

sadly, i didn't know that the whole "welcome to san gabriel" sign is synonymous with CASH ONLY. i only go to san gabriel when i am dying for vietnamese-chinese food after having been uprooted from garden grove's little saigon ... san gabriel's only 10 mins closer than little saigon from where i now am in west LA. but it's a straight shot, and i come back home much more satisfied than when i leave little saigon. i get to leave the valley, a tummy full of happy. i say the food at this restaurant is better than seafood cove or seafood paradise or seafood parasel in garden grove. okay, those are the places i grew up with, and the only places i'd ever gone to resembling this. this is...so much better. get the morning glory!! it is incredible. it is my new favorite dish in all the world. the elephant clams are the way to go - don't get the other clams. they are very small. and for some reason my brother ordered that walnut shrimp ... smothered in mayonnaise. it was surprising that that was on the menu. it's pretty disgusting. the shrimp inside is yummy of course, i rinsed it off in my bowl of cat fish soup (i forget how bland cat fish is when it's in soup... i should have gotten it fried) ... and then ... i tried the mayonnaise-fish soup that i had just created. sigh. i liked it. i know, i'm a pig. four stars! great service - a man comes to our table and screams "WHO WANTS BEER!" we order that, and we order lobster. you know when the lobster came out? not even a minute later. what the fuck. amazing. one star off for questionable ethics and decor. well isn't it traditional for pink cloths to be draped everywhere and chandeliers hung all over the goddamn place and anywhere you look there's a gold-painted dragon staring at you while you sit on vinyl torn up fancy chairs? it's not like home is all. notice i will not delve into the ethics part. i don't want this place shut down, ever, (B grade and all. B grade = BEST! right) so i won't utter another word about that. god the wait was long, but surely worth it and worth the drive. i left very happy.

you know there's something special about their house special lobster and french style beef cubes when every single table orders one. at this point i doubt there are many who haven't heard of this place, but if you've been living under a rock, here are some helping suggestions: -arrive EARLY (especially on weekends) as they don't take reservations -parking in their lot is a mess so just find street parking -going in a group is a must so you can try a variety of their dishes like: house special lobster (their small lobsters are usually a minimum of 3lbs so don't let the waiter convince you to buy anything bigger unless that's the only dish you'll order) clams in basil garlic sauce pea shoots b�l渃 lc (french style beef cubes) fried fish in sweet and spicy sauce yam leaves with garlic (a MUST if in season) -their dishes can be a bit salty so balance it out with some veggies. -keep an eye out for asian celebs who tend to dine later in the evening (like jay chou on 2/8)

If you haven't been here then you're missing one of the best place to eat Chinese food. 蔜he Chinese food they serve here though seems to be a very interesting mix of Cantonese and Vietnamese/ Cambodian flavors. 蔠hat results though is nothing short of amazing. 蔐ike everyone says, you must try the lobster. 蔒ake sure you're prepared for the bill though because when we ordered, ours came out to $126 just for the lobster. 蔍t was huge and very tasty so it was worth it when split between 9 people. 蔄nother highlight is the steamed red snapper ($76). 蔔ot cheap either but was quite good. 蔜hey even used the head of the fish to make a soup for us. 蔄nother favorite dish of mine is the Vietnamese Beef (Beef Loc Lac I believe?). 蔍 think every table there ordered this dish. 蔄lso try the deep fried squid and deep fried tofu which were very very good. 蔎ust writing this review is making my mouth water...

my sister and her family LOVE this place and try to visit every time they're in l.a. i found it good but not exceptional. the house special lobster is pretty darn tasty, but in general there's not much meat on a lobster to really justify the work. the clams with basil and chili were nice as well. the food tasted of high quality, and i guess since we had made reservations for a large table beforehand, we lucked out by getting our own little "room" to ourselves. they also offer (complimentary?) hot and sour soup. overall pretty good but i'd venture out to try other places before coming back here.

This place is the spot. i swear to you its really good. why get the 555 deal at dominoes when you can come here for lunch and almost everything is 5 dollars. the kong pao anything is good. chicken and squid is awesome. the claims are spectacular. get it with black bean sauce its awesome. the fish is also really great to. i can't say anything bad about this place. the waiters are fun to talk to. the short guy with the glasses is kind of weird though but he's cool. You get free soup and oranges to ! you can't beat these prices. Also this place is known for their lobster. man the lobster is made to perfection (asian style of course) . i can eat the lobster all day. it has lots a flavor that just hits the right spot in your mouth. i guess its like an orgasm in the mouth.

We go here for one plate: fried sole with house special sauce. The sauce is some kind of Thai? sweet garlic basil slightly spicy...sauce. Whatever it is, I wish I knew how to make it! The fish is deep fried and served with a separate bowl of slightly warm sauce. SOOO good. The house special lobster is alright. It's good but I wouldn't say it's spectacular compared to other restaurants of the same class. Service and decor is what you'd expect from a Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant. It depends who you get. Some are overtly rude and others are normal/friendly.

3.5 stars. It's probably is my fault I did not spend a lot of time reading the review before I went there. 蔍 took an out of town guest there for a authentic Chinese. �We ordered lobster, hot and sour soup, a veggie dish, and one more dish which I could not remember. 蔜he lobster was HUGE! 蔜hey gave us a 4 lbs lobster for two of us and just that dish alone was over $60! That was a very expensive lobster!!!! 蔍 wish they have told us the price and also told us that they are going to give us a 4 lbs lobster which if they did we might have not ordered it. 蔍 am not sure it's because I don't speak Chinese. 蔄nyway, be warned if you have a small dinning party. The total bill came to over $100 before tax for my friend and I. 蔜here are many authentic Chinese restaurant in this area that won't cost as much and it's still as good as Newport Tan Cang Seafood. 蔍 won't be back nor I would recommend this place to anyone.

My first trip there about two years ago was exceptonal. 蔜he Newport Special Lobster was super, as were the pea sprouts and crab fried rice. �Second trip, yesterday evening, was horrible and very upsetting. 蔜his restaurant has the finest display of fresh seafood in tanks to be seen anywhere. 蔜he different variety of crabs, lobster and other live shellfish was superb. 蔣et some moronic chef found it necessary to destroy it all by cooking everything in an overload of what appeared to be lard or some other grease. 蔍 understand the need for a lipid in wok cooking but this meal was gross. 蔄mazing lobster and clams with basil and even the pea sprouts were doused in grease. 蔠hat could have been a truly amazing meal (at a fair price) was turned, literally, into sickening food. �I'd try it again when I get over the reminder of what went on in the mens room before I left, (which needed attention), but would insist on telling the waiter when ordering that if it's overloaded with grease, I'm sending it back. What a shame.

Lobster is wonderful, especially with lots of egg. From the outside, the restaurant may look like it'll be lenient on your wallet, but once you've had the lobster, fish, fillet cubes, you're dropping around $90 or more. The spices they use in all the food are excellent. I call it "asian creole" food. Try it, you'll walk away satisfied. Get their early to avoid a wait. It's in the golden deli plaza so parking will be crazy.

I'm not the kind of person who likes to judge a place more heavily on decor or service than the food, but sometimes, rudeness can really put me off. The three of us were seated at a table that had just been cleaned off, but, as it sometimes happens, there was a little piece of wet-looking food on the chair that my little sister was going to sit on. If no one was around, I would have just taken a napkin and cleaned it off myself, no biggie. But the bus-boy was still at the table with a rag, so I asked him about it. Instead, without a word, he points to the other chair on the otherside of the table, silent-speak for, "I don't particularly want to do that so just sit on another chair and live with that piece of food there while I don't do my job completely." So what if she had done that? Would that piece of food have been sitting there forever, so that eventually it would grow into a living organism on it's own, feeding on the other ignored scraps of food that fall on said chair and perhaps mating with other pieces to create a giant food-scrap-chair colony? Luckily, though I was quite annoyed and disgusted, imagining toddler-sized mounds of leftover food gaining motor skills and joy riding in expensive cars, I did what I usually do and flicked it off myself. Crisis averted, though I was not left emotionally unscathed. Even though that event left a bad taste in my mouth, the food most certainly did not. The famed lobster was perfection, as were the other dishes we had ordered. I love that they use so much garlic. They must go through vats and vats of it daily. I would come back for the food, but not for the service.

We got pretty spoiled by fantastic Chinese restaurants in San Francisco and were on a mission to find something comparable to those in LA. Unfortunately the closest one we found (through Yelp) was this gem! Sooo worth the drive and the wait (gets very crowded around 6:30-7:00 pm). Great staff, delicious food! The favorites are House Special Lobster(crab or live shrimp), French Style Beef, Salt n Pepper squid (shrimp). Yummy smoothies with bobba! We've become weekly regulars there. Highly recommend this place!!!

Yes, this restaurant lives up to the hype. There's a reason why every time I go here, there's always a crowd out the door waiting for a table. Be prepare to wait if you arrive during peak hours. My advice is to arrive right when they open (11:30) if you want lunch. Or at 5, if you want dinner. Other than that, the wait for a table can be up to an hour or even longer. Once your number has been called and you're walking to your table, you will notice that every table has either the house special lobster or the Bo Luc Lac (french beef). I had to find out what all the hype was about so I ordered their version of the surf and turf. The lobster could not be any better; the freshness of the crustacean brings out the sweetness of the meat. The spices perfectly compliments this dish. The beef also lives up to the hype, very tender and tasty arriving on a bed of onion tomato slices and lettuce. If grading by the food itself, they would have received the full 5 stars, but I have to deduct a star for service. Because it's always busy, the staff can be overwhelmed and you might have to wait a while before they can refill your tea pot.

I remember the G.o.D. (good ole days) when I didn't have to wait freakin' 2 hours for a table. Use to be, everything on the menu rocked. Now it's too crowded and too 'touristy' (is that possible??) so the food can be inconsistent. But the lobster still rules. And don't forget the clams with basil (instead of black bean sauce). BTW, the place is not chinese nor vietnamese, but a cross between the two. That's why the food/spices/herbs have that unique blending. Enjoy hangin' out in front of the 7-eleven.

Non-locals: This is NOT a fancy schmancy seafood restaurant, don't let its english name fool you. 蔍t's however the best place to go to if you're celebrating a chinese holiday with your entire family. 蔜he seafood is fresh, the food comes super fast, and it's reasonably priced. 蔣ea it has a "B" rating but Asians don't care about that. 蔈xpect to eat, pay, and go cuz you got 30 people lined up outside gawking at your lobster through the window. 蔍f you're not eating with a big group dont go there cuz there's always a longer wait for smaller tables.

If I was simply rating the food, I would give this place a 4 or maybe even a five star. 蔋owever despite their great food, I have to downgrade my rating due to the way in which they charge for their house special lobster. 蔣ou would think that since they are known for their lobster and rightfully so, they would charge and serve you as they say they would and not deceive you by telling you how many lbs your lobster is going to be and charging you by the weight of the lobster. 蔍 stopped going here about 4yrs ago after a bad experience from them serving me a supposed 4lb lobster with 4 claws and about 3 pieces of tail meat. 蔙EALLY??? that's some special lobster! 蔍 went there about 2 months ago because I wanted an out of town friend to try this lobster and it was actually a good experience, it seemed like what they put on our table was actually a full lobster and not part of a large batch that they made and just randomly put on our plate. 蔄nd because of my good experience, I decided to go there again the week after and sure enough, the previous week was a fluke. 蔕nce again, they served a supposed 4lb lobster who must have had part of it's tail cut off prior to being cooked or something, or once again they just put together some pieces from a big batch and plated it and called it a 4lb lobster. 蔍'm sorry, but if you're going to charge me based on how much a lobster weighs, then serve me the whole lobster and not just what you think is equivalent to it from a large batch.

They lobster is extremely good. They also have a lot of good typical vietnamese stuff. The resturant actually makes vietnamese/chinese food. They are both really similar. The Salt and pepper pork chops are good, and fish in clay pot. It is a little pricy but lunch special prices make it all better. They have daily specials that no one really knows about. You can ask them when you come in. They will tell you. Their special beef cubes are really really good. But it is only offered about once or twice a month. Apparently they moved recently, I just found out. But, it is the same owners and should be still good!

Best fresh live lobster in town. Order the house special and it will not disappoint. They've kept their food very consistent considering how long they've been open, which is very nice because I can expect to take visitors out to great lobster whenever I come here. I've tried their king crab twice and it was soooo good. We had it cooked garlic style and mannn the meat is sweet. Combine seafood with French beer and you have yourself a feast. Another favorite dish is the clam with basil. Lunch specials here are awesome. Really decent prices for quality food. They give you a bowl of hot and sour soup on the house during lunch. For dinner they give you heavenly oranges after your meal. This is by far one of the few Asian places where you'll receive superb customer service. The waiters all speak English and several dialects of Chinese (Mandarin/Cantonese) and Vietnamese. They will suggest popular items if you are new to the place. Over the years, I've seen more and more diverse crowds eat at this establishment. They recently moved to their current location and it looks like a 5-star Chinese restaurant. The interior decor is amazing and if you're looking for Asian inspiration for your home, this is a great place to check out. When you purchase a lobster or king crab, you can request to take a pix of your meal while it's alive before you eat it. When purchasing the lobster, I recommend getting the smaller lobster because the meat is more tender when you order the smaller lobsters, but if you just want to show off, i suppose the larger lobsters would do.

OK, I'm into Asian food. Really into it. As in I'll drive an hour to be the only white girl in the restaurant enjoying every bite. This place is worth every minute spent starving in the car to get there and the hour trip home again. Clearly from the name it's a seafood joint and dish they do best is the lobster. I think you're supposed to order this for a table of people but I have polished it off with just one other person accompanying me b/c it's that delicious. Also amazing: the fried string beans, the pea tendrils, and the French steak. My only very small request: stop giving me a fork already! I may be white but I am remarkably dexterous with chop sticks. If I needed a fork I would ask for it. If you're into real Chinese food and wouldn't be caught dead eating orange chicken, this is the real deal.

Was just there for dinner and the the food is great with very attentive service especially for a Cantonese style seafood restaurant. Just that alone is deserving of all the stars! The house lobster was a winner! I must say something about the decor as well. Not many Chinese seafood restaurants that serve good food pay much attention to designing a nice space for dining, they do. It gets really crowded so be there early or if you can make a reservation.

This place used to be Marie Callendars but changed overship and converted to Newport Seafood now. Dishes are $5-$7 each, which is a steal coming from the west side. Great food and great service! I will pack my friends into my car next time I go again. :)

OK, I agree the lobster is really good and the new location is nice and pleasant. 蔅ut most of the dishes here are just so so. 蔍 have much better fish, crabs, shrimps, clams, duck, ribs and beef elsewhere. 蔜he crabs we we had were not well received (got to remember to stop ordering that; makes you wonder why they can cook the crabs the same way that they cook lobster). 蔍t's sad that only the lobster is fit for special occasions while the other dishes are plainly unimpressive. 蔅ut I guess no one says that you can't just order the lobster.

I went here a loooong time ago with friends. This place was delicious! I'm more of a crab than a lobster gal but the lobster was so fresh and good! It was marinated in that "asian type sauce" which made extra special. I have not eaten anything else so I would not know how the food would it be but I assume it to be yummy. It was very packed so it is a popular place

This must be a "go-to" place for lobster in Alhambra. I took my mom here after reviewing the reviews on Yelp. Well, I wouldn't say I was so impressed with the lobster sauce they recommended. I think I like just steamed lobster rather than friend Chinese style. Food was okay. Service was okay, kind of slow and not attentive. They do not take credit cards even though almost every table's bill is probably ranges $100-$200 for 2-3 people.

This is a great place. Very clean. Fairly professional staff. For dishes, I recommend: Newport lobster is great, they only had a big one, 4 pounds ($63.80), but luckily we had four hungry people to eat it. Their geoduck clam dish was really good, we got 'fried heads' which were excellent, with very buttery taste. Peasprouts are a good side and the 'French' beef loclac dish was pretty good, too. Definitely one of my favorite places in LA.

So, three friends and I braved the holiday rush and actually dared to go to Newport Seafood on Christmas eve. 蔍 had called the restaurant to get a gauge as to a good time to come, and the dude told me that we should be there by six at the latest, preferably around 5. 蔠e weren't able to get there until about ten to six, but I figured we'd be seated in half an hour or at the most, forty five minutes. �Well, at around 20 to eight, we finally got our table. 蔣eah, I couldn't believe we waited that long, and normally I wouldn't, but it was kind of a Christmas eve adventure. 蔍 knew it would be crowded, but I didn't quite expect the mob scene that was there. 蔉ortunately, I was with good company, or I probably would have gone out of my mind. 蔍 think one of my friends, who I'm not convinced has ever been to a packed Chinese restaurant before, was shellshocked. �Admittedly, the hilarious sight of my friend's eyeballs glazing over the crowds was the best Christmas ever, heh heh.) 蔜he smell and sight of plate after plate of mouth watering seafood platters were killing us. 蔠e started joking about bribing the seated patrons for their dishes. 蔍 think my SGV rookie pal was about to if the waiter hadn't called our number. Anyway, the food was amazing, as all the diners have said. 蔍t probably helps that we had to wait so long and so our appetites were fully awakened! �A strategy of the owners, perhaps?) 蔉or the four of us, we got the house special lobster (4 lbs for $15.95/lb), clams with basil and garlic, steamed spot prawns (1lb for $29.99), beef bo lac, and sauteed peasprouts. 蔄nd indeed, these dishes are worthy of the praise that people sing. 蔍 was worried that the three seafood dishes might kind of blend into each other, the flavor combinations and preparation methods of each dish were distinct and memorable. 蔍 must point out that the spot prawns weren't on the menu, but we had asked about them upon seeing the live prawns swimming in one of Newport's tanks by the front. 蔜hese fresh, sweet prawns are delicately steamed and come with a light dipping sauce (of soy, garlic, scallions, ginger, and chili). 蔛ome of the prawns were even pregnant and full of roe! I have to remove a star due to the fact that it is a madhouse here and they don't take reservations. 蔜hat said, I am dying to return to try their crab dishes (e.g. salt and pepper crab, crab with black bean sauce), and their whole fish dishes. 蔠ell, I guess the next time I'm up for a long wait (albeit hopefully not quite as bad!), I will make the trip.

This is a great place for lunch. We took my co-worker here for her birthday and it came out to $40 for 5 people. That's freakin amazing. The portions are huge. My favourite was the beef loc lac which is the Vietnamese French Style Cube Beef. I actually had better but it depends on your preference. The marinade was a bit too sweet for me. We ordered a couple of stuff that had gravy sauce and I wasn't too thrilled about them. The lobster was overpriced so I didn't get to try it but everyone raves about it. I would definitely come back.

It is a Vietnamese Owned Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant, and you should definitely go for their lobster. Yes, you heard me right...when my cousin was talking about taking me to the restaurant for lobster, I was skeptical about it. 蔙eally? A Vietnamese owned restaurant for lobster? 蔣es, really, their lobster is definitely the best I have ever had, not only the quality of the lobster (not your average $7.99/lb special priced lobster), but the taste...it is full of flavor that even after several washes, my hands still had the leftover smell...don't get me wrong...I am not complaining...I am giving it four stars for the lobster only.

I really want to give this place an even lower rating than what it is currently (to balance it out) because this place is way over hyped. Nothing really to write home about if you are Chinese. Paid $75 for a 4.5 lb lobster that was slightly better than other restaurants. Their Kung Pao Chicken was prettty good. Half of their dishes involve some sort of garlic. The french beef cubes were to expectation (it was very tender and had lots of flavor). $128 w/o tip is insanely expensive for 3 people at a Chinese restaurant, but it's mother's day eh. Bring down the price a bit and maybe a 4 star rating is warranted. (FYI: my family went to a supermarket and the lobster is $7/lb while this restaurant charged a little over $15/lb)... deserves 3.5 stars

This is the best Chinese seafood restaurant I have ever had in the States! We had lobster, chili crab, squid, shrimp, toufu, chicken, vegie and fried rice. Taste is really awesome! The quantity of each dish is triple of the size in the usual restaurant. Service is also very good. Waiters come to change plate from time to time. Also the best environment Chinese restaurant I have ever been in the States, reminding me of the restaurant in China. For all what we had, it is $50 per person. Considering what we had, that was really worth the price.

i "HEART" Newport (Tan Cang) Seafood. i have been going to Newport almost 10 years now and the food is likely the best Chinese/Vietnamese you will find in the SGV. the usual suspects for me include: garlic & basil clams (preferable to the black bean/garlic variety) bo luc lac (vietnamese style beef cubes) the house special lobster or crab ALL of their steamed fishes (beware some are seasonally priced and can add up to a hefty, but well worth it bill) walnut shrimp almost all other dishes i've had have been above average at the least, but the above are definitely exceptional. oh as an FYI -- this place is CASH ONLY and to those who complain about the service (HELLO it's a chinese restaurant!), but i find it well worth the slight inconvenience for the good eats and value. SIDE NOTE: Parking is hard to find since they have a shared lot with the mini-mall and 7/11. It's a good idea to drop off whoever you can to nab a table number ASAP while you circle around the lot... 'cause there WILL be a wait.

This is by far the best vietnamese restaurant to get some house special lobster. It is a must for us to get a lobster here even if they run out of the small or medium lobster, we'll take the large and finish it. =p Other stuff we order here are: bo luc lac, clams with basil leaves, snow peas with garlic and soup bong ca (not sure thats how you say/spell it). Nobody eats the soup except for me, more for me, I suppose. We've taken friends here from the bay area and this is the place they have to eat before going back. Nothing compares to the lobster here in the bay area (so I was told). There's also lobster eggs thats comes along with the dish. There's also locations in santa ana and rowland heights. Been to those also and was awesome! Come early to beat the crowd and find parking cuz Golden Deli next door is pretty popular also.

STEP ONE: Stop by an ATM and load up with a good sum of cash - think at least $10-$20/person depending on if you're ordering lobster/crab etc. STEP TWO: Perhaps go to the restroom before you go - this is all heresay but someone in my party went to the restroom and wasn't so pleased - he actually lost his appetite after going. STEP THREE: Go there and enjoy the great food. Man this place is well-priced (probably because it's cash only). Since we didn't feel like spending massive amounts of time on ordering we just got the family style dinners. Dou Miao, kung pao chicken, soup, steamed fish, CRAB, and clams. We enjoyed every bit of it - if I were to choose I woudlln't get the kungpao chicken - not because it was bad but because it's not exactly what I consider a normal authentic dish and plus there is so much better stuff here! But alas, fixed meal it was. Service was great, but I can't agree with someone else that it didnt' seem they were rushing us. IT was great that our food came almost instantaneously and didn't taste like it was pre-cooked (although we know it must've been somewhat....how else can food come out in less than 10 minutes? minus the steamed fish). They kept clearing our tables so quickly, which isnt' bad. As soon as we paid however, they started taking away everything in possible sight. The person at our table who went to go to the restroom and they ALMOST took away his plate- I had to grab their attention to stop (didnt' even ask if he was done). But to me a minor problem at best. Overall a great experience, no complaints. Food was fresh and tasty at a good price. Yummy seafood.... :) [Much cheaper than my current dwelling of SF.. I think the waiters chuckled when they heard me scream OMG this is so cheap! Living in SF and having the money sucked out of you, you realize good Mandarin food at a good price is hard to come by, most likely due to the rent]

If you have a craving for lobster then Newport is the place to go. 蔜hey make the best lobster around and it is well worth the price that you pay for it. 蔖ractically everyone goes there for the lobster, plus now they have the snow crab. 蔜he restaurant is chinese/vietnamese style, family dinner style. 蔜he decor of the restaurant is pretty good considering it is a chinese restaurant and the place is usually crowded on friday nights and weekends, I'm talking about wait time of at least 1hour. 蔜hey do not take reservations, so it would be wise to arrive early to get a table of get on the waitlist. 蔍 have been there 3-4 times and will probably go there more often for the lobster.

This place is brilliant and always busy. The crab is the best, lobster good as well. We have a set of things we always seem to order and try not to stray from it. The deep fried tofu is pillowy and divine. The pea sprouts are the veg we like the best. The beef loc lac is a nice complement to all the seafood. Other good seafood choices are the clam with black bean sauce and the salt and pepper shrimp. Come early to avoid long waits, but even if you have to wait you can pick out the lucky crustaceans you plan on eating beforehand. 蔍t's better with lots of people so you can order more things.

A great Chinatown restaurant. 蔍t is one of the better designed/looking restaurants in San Gabriel. 蔜he waiters also all speak English, which is not always the case in this area. 蔛ervice was fast and incredibly attentive for a local joint. 蔋ad the kung pao chicken, the New Port Lobster (15 dollars a pound), and fried noodles with sea food. 蔠hile I've had slightly better versions of the dishes, these were still quite exceptional. 蔜he only thing I would say is that 15 bucks/pound for lobster is hard to deal with after you've gone to many Monterey Park restaurants where the lobster is free if you spend 30 bucks on other food (Elite/Blue Ocean, e.g.) or 6 bucks per pound with a buy one get one free special. 蔄lso, this place gets quite a line for dinner on the weekends at least (when I've gone). 蔛o I recommend coming early or being willing to wait. 蔛till, all in all, this is a delicious authentic restaurant with fresh seafood. 蔊o!

We were looking for a new Chinese restaurant in Alhambra area that was comparable to our old one that seems to have changed management twice now and we're not to happy with the price or service. Tried this place out per all the Yelpers. 蔄 bit of a hike to get there but I can say we like the decor, were seated quickly on a Thurs. nite but then didn't see any waiter or drinks for a good 13 minutes after they gave us our menus. �Place was bustling and food service was slow. Though we ordered soup, everything came at once and we didn't have the time to enjoy the soup before our other dishes arrived simultaneously. The had a good selection of foods and there were many I would like to come back and give them a second chance. 蔋owever, the waiter pushed the House Lobster Special on us and it was OK but there was so much flavoring in it that it overwhelmed our senses. Should have stayed with our original desire to try the lobster with garlic sauce (so we could compare to our old restaurant on Garfield Ave.). Had the large prawns in batter. They were delicious and a large portion to say the least. 蔈njoyed their hot and sour "seafood" soup big change from the standard pork flavored ones. 蔋ad plenty to take home but I can see why there are really large groups of people dining together because the portions are pretty hefty and the bill was too. 蔆an only give a 3-star for now as I explained above. 蔍f they had half stars, probably for now would have given 2 1/2-stars. We'll see when we decide to give it a second go around.

You can smell the aroma from a block away. This place is notorious for its decadent seafood. A must try is the house special lobster. Its a little bit on the greasy side, but you can't complain when it taste that good!!! Another must try for those who want to splurge is the King Crab. The meat is sweet and the great thing about it is that it is prepared in a way where you don't have to dig through to get to the meat.

Atmosphere: Semi Big but not to big dinning area. I like how the booths are separated with dividers to give you a little privacy but its kind of see through so not to much privacy. Dinning tables in the middle are in the open and plenty of room for groups. Service: Is average. Nothing special your order and you get your food. Staff is nice and friendly. But sometimes hard to get their attention. Food: Ordered the Steam Clams which was just steam clams what more can you want. Its steam clams. I love steam clams simple and cooked right. Most places tend to over cook. Also got shrimp with garlic sauce. That was really good. Very flavorful. And lastly had the Fried noodle with seafood. It was good needed something but still it was good. The squid needed the garlic sauce from the shrimp that went well together. Con: Needed more people so that we could try more things. I would definitely go back.

One of the best Chinese Vietnamese food I had. 蔍t was my husbands birthday and we took the family here. 蔍 ordered the dinner set ($108.00) and for 8 people it was a lot but I for 10 it would be enough. The service was good and quick. 蔜his place is busy after 7:00 p.m. 蔍 would recommend coming in early before 6:00 p.m. 蔜heir crab and lobster seems to be the most popular seafood dish. 蔠e had the crab and it was gone before anything else. 蔜he booba drinks were authentic in taste specially the ones with exotic fruit--try it if you are adventurous enough.

Food- Probably the best Chinese (or Vietnamese) restaurant that we have eaten at in the Los Angeles area. Decor- A little better than a 'diner'. Don't expect much in this regard. Very, very busy and a little noisy. Service- The waiters circulate regularly and are resonably responsive. Tip- You must get there befor 5:30PM if you don't want an extended wait. We arrived at 5:15 and were promptly seated. I had to go out to the car to get something by 5:45 and there were 35 people waiting for a table. By the time we left at 6:15 the line was well out the door. The fish on a sizzling platter was simply excellent, and remiscent of Crustacean in Beverly Hills (at 1/5 the price). The french beef was pretty good (and I'm not a beef person in general) and tender. The seasoning was similar in the two dishes (which surprised me). We avoided the lobster due to the price- $16.99 per pound averaging 4-5# would have well exceeded the rest of the bill, which (including a nice seafood soup with bean curd) was $48 (including tax and tip).

Best chinese food in the neighborhood, 蔴ands down. Good prices, especially for lunch special. Some of my favorite: the lobster, pea sprouts, kung pao chicken, salt & pepper pork chop (warning, plenty of msg on this one), and the fried fish (forgot which one specifically). �If you don't need to go in there during peak dining hours, especially on weekends on holidays, I suggest going at another time, unless you don't mind hour-long wait. Went on either Christmas or New Year's night one time, and the wait was ~1.5h. But the food is worth it either way.

The house special lobster is the tastiest lobster I ever had. 蔈verything else I had was pretty standard for a good Chinese seafood restaurant. 蔜he lobster is definitely worth a try. 蔍t was about $16 a pound when I was there, and we had a small guy. 蔍t was fresh as expected but it's all about how they cooked it. �The place was quite busy. 蔠e went on a Friday night at 9pm and had to wait 20 minutes about so it wasn't too bad. 蔜he service was pretty good considering it's a Chinese restaurant. 蔜he waiters were friendly and actually smiled. 蔠e had a nice sized table and didn't feel crammed like at some places. 蔠ill come again.

Okay, this restaurant is great but a bit over rated. 蔜he french style beef dish was one of my favorite. 蔠e had a 3 lb. lobster 蕎hich was very pricey. 蔜he service is surprisingly good for a Chinese restaurant. 蔜he parking could be a problem if you get there after 6pm. 蔕ne more thing: 蔲ood has lots of MSG, which probably makes the food taste so good. 蔍 have no problem with that (that's real Chinese food!) but be prepared to get super thirsty afterwards.

This place is always crowded with a long wait. Expecting it to be Mother's day we arrived at 5pm and surprisingly it's only half full but filling up fast. The House special Lobster here is the Bomb!! This is why we're here. Along with this they serve the usual Asian dinner fair in this area clam and basil, salt pepper shrimp, crab, steamed fish. The whole assortment and try do moat of these dishes fairly well too. It's nice not to have to wait for once.

love this place!!! i can honestly say every dish was awesome! lobster in their special sauce is a must. walking in and out of the restaurants no matter how many people is sitting in a party, EVERYONE has an order of the lobster... probably because you cant say no to this dish!!!!! yum :) also, last time i was here after my graduation, the waiter suggested us to try their popular dish of gooey duck cooked 2-way. 蕂ne of them were the first dish out and idk if it was because my family and i were hungry or what, but it really was a wonderful dish also. go and try the lobster in this place! it's unforgettable and you certainly will not regret it.

Unbelievably fresh! 蔠ith Chinese food, I think its easy to mask certain flavors by the various types of sauces. 蔍 had the Chinese Broccoli with hoisen sauce. 蔜he greens were so fresh that the taste just completely filled your pallet. The chow mein was very good. Lastly, I ordered the steamed clams. 蔜he clams were perfectly done. 蔔ot under done, or a minute over done. 蔜hey were nicely steamed with ginger. 蔍 loved it!!!! I also had a beef dish. 蔜he beef was extremely tender. 蔕ne bite into the meat, I got a nice bite of meat, and the meat melted in my mouth. �I can't praise this establishment enough. 蔍 will have our next corporate dinner at this restaurant if possible. 蔍 would recommend this to everyone!

my family goes here all the time. We're a hugee fan of this place. we always order the pea sprouts,salt and pepper pork chop,clam with basil sauce,and 蕇alt and pepper shrimp. the service here is good. You don't have to wait a long time until your food comes. It's really fast. I like how the taste of the food is consistent every time we go here. i also like how they give you hot and spicy soup at lunch time. You must try the lobster. It's really good.They give you huge portions and you all share. 蔜his one is much bigger than the one at rowland heights.The steamed fish with the red sauce is one of my favorites. The steamed fish is also crispy which I like.I also like their fried tofu with the sauce. 蔕verall, this is my favorite chinese restaurant. I'd come here over and over. They never disappoint. =)

I alwayrs order the Kung Pao Chicken when I come here because they seem to do something special with it. It is my favorite here!! The taste and texture is just hard to describe. We got the deep fried calamari in spicy salt and I thought it tasted a bit airy like too much batter and not much squid, and it was oily. The waiters are friendly but sometimes it's weird when they're all just sitting there with you. They sometimes seem a little too overly friendly or just perverted. I went with two other people and all of our dishes had some kind of food stuck and crusted on it. It doesn't happen all the time but this day it did.

After all of the glowing reviews about this place I had to try it out. The place was great.

I've been here once for lunch and once for dinner. The restaurant is clean, which means so much because Chinese restaurants are usually not that clean. The dishes I like are the lobster, crab, french style beef, peasprouts, and clams with basil sauce. I think they have good noodles too, but I don't remember. The pearl tea drinks are good too. You get a lot of oranges at the end of the meal. The dish I did not like so much was beef with Chinese broccoli that was on the lunch special menu (select dishes for $6-7). 蔛orry, the beef was pretty tough. Overall, this is the best Chinese restaurant I have ever been to. For me, it is the only restaurant that is worth the drive to San Gabriel/Alhambra. I only wish it was located more west so I could go more often, but the location is probably how they are able to keep prices low.

I came here with seven friends on a Saturday around 11:15AM. 蔜his place is crowded! But with good reason. Let me start off by saying that this place has EXCELLENT prices for the setting and quality of food. 蔣es, you can find these prices elsewhere in Asian districts, but not with the beautiful decor, cleanliness, and service that Newport Seafood offers. PRICES - From $6.25 lunch specials to luxurious king crab / lobster dinners - it depends on what you want. 蔜he lunch specials are an amazing price that beat out even Orange County's Vietnamese district. 蔜here are about 20 dishes on that menu, and then a separate menu with many other foods. FOOD - There is everything from traditional Chinese kung pao dishes to Vietnaese hu tieu noodles to a mix of both. 蔍f you were to walk in without knowing anything prior, you may not be able to discern whether this is a Chinese or Vietnamese restaurant. 蔜ried about 10 dishes here, and most were phenomenal even compared to do higher end Asian restaurants. I definitely recommend the basil clam. 蔣ou may want to turn down the beef stew special that they try to convince you of during your order though (it seems that the waiters are compelled to try). DECOR - A beautiful, modern decor that is untypical of Asian restaurants with such prices. 蔍t used to be a Marie Calendars, but you would never be able to tell from the inside. 蔜he waiting area has ample Asian-styled bench seating with beautiful red lanterns up top, and giant tanks of sea critters which you can marvel at while waiting. 蔜here are quite a large number of tables here, and the turnover seems to pretty quick, but so many people go here that the wait may be a bit long (just goes to show how good the place is). 蔜he tables and chairs had no duck tape or stains, as might be common in other restaurants. 蔜his is a very clean place. I cannot speak for the restroom though as I did not use it. �SERVICE - Most of the staff seemed to speak English, Vietnamese, AND Cantonese with great fluency. �I spoke in Vietnamese and friends spoke in Cantonese). 蔇espite having to wait an hour for a table, the host offered to take our order prior to seating so we could get the food earlier. 蔠e ended up not doing so, but the food came out in very reasonable time regardless. 蔛ome of the girls were cold, sitting right under the vents, and the host offered to turn that vent off "just for you - only you". 蔠aiters were prompt for service and even joked with us for a while. �AFTERTHOUGHTS - Next time, I would want to try to more expensive items. 蔜hey are apparently well-known for their immense lobsters that they hand-pick from Newport.

The dishes were well prepared and delicious the first few bites, but the insane air conditioning made all our food cold. If you're a fast eater this place is awesome. If not just go with the flow. The service is really great and friendly, it's very clean and the dining room is very energetic. Lots of chi flowing in this restaurant. The house special lobster was amazing but noticed lots of tables with Kung pao chicken, will definitely try it next time. Food comes out lightning speed to make up for the hour long wait, but it's worth it for non greasy Chinese food. I would have given more stars if I were a fast eater, but delicious nonetheless.

Week three upon stumbling into this place and we have been back twice. I don't usually like to wait in line for my food, but we waited for about 1 1/2 hour the second time we were there just to satisfy our TanCang craving. I'm not a big fan of lobster or crabs, so we ordered the hot and sour soup with catfish, the French beef and the clams with the basil sauce. Yummy. My husband loves the French beef, but I'm all about the clams and the soup. We ordered too much for two people and had to take some home. The soup still tastes good even the next day. If you've never been here, try it, you won't regret it.

My parents have been taking me here since I was a wee lass so this place always brings back good memories! Family style is best, so come with a crowd for dinner or by your lonesome for lunch specials! I order: beef cubes with lime/pepper sauce, sweet and sour fish soup, house special stir fried lobster and crab with basil and garlic, clams with basil, steamed fish, steamed veggies, crispy tofu, and that has me happy and plump. Loose clothes recommended. Make a reservation if you have a big group-- if over 8, you can probably reserve one of their semi-private rooms on the side wing. Fun times.

This place is amazing. The food is good and enough for family style. It's a bit loud but that's cool with me. You don't have to keep your voice down in this place. If a booth is open it's yours, you don't even have to ask. Went twice within three days. Booth and no waiting on the first, table and a fifteen minute wait the second day but the wait is worth it. My only issue is the Crab with Curry, very good but hard to eat. Give yourself plenty of time to pick at the meat. Had too many dishes to list all excellent except the Clams, good but not as flavorful as the other dishes. We asked our waiter for recomondations and he was right on. When it's busy your waiter gets busy too so flagging down any waiter is good and they were all helpful.

After reading all the glowing reviews for Newport I decided to make the trek to San Gabriel for lunch. 蔠ent in around 1ish PM and the parking lot was full (although the lot wasn't really that big...) but managed to find a space eventually. 蔜here was like ~10 min wait for a dining room that was less than half capacity. 蔄nyways the food was aight. 蔉or four we ate about $42 for 6 dishes (this was on the lunch special menu) and it was ok...a bit too salty for my taste. 蔜he prices for the lunch special is passable although the portions are kinda on the smallish side. 蔄ll dishes for lunch are under $10/dish and they have a pretty good variety of meat, veggies, and seafood. 蔜he clams w/ black bean sauce was solid-the clams were a good size and the flavors were really good. 蔜he sauteed pea sprouts were tasty (a bit too shiny from the oil/grease...). 蔜he salt/pepper fried shrimp was too oily and didn't have enough flavor-same for the chinese broccoli and beef. 蔕verall food was average-a bit too salty and oily but that's pretty typical for eating out at asian restaurants. 蔜he service was surprisingly fast-too a point where it makes you feel rushed?...So yeah *** for Newport!

Ehh.. Went back for the first time since they moved to their new location.. The new space is campy, yet nice and with good acoustics. You don't overhear loud, screaming families the way you do in most places that serve this kind of food. Only knock against it is the food itself. Let me start by saying that I LOVED this place. Was one of my faves in SGV...and probably why I walked away so disappointed. The flavor's been compromised by the enlarged dining room & increase in patrons. Everything's fresh...but tastes bleh and comes out lukewarm to boot. Sad to say, but I'd probably enjoy Sam Woo BBQ more at this point. Service is attentive.. The wait isn't long...and as always...the prices are tough to beat. Wish I could recommend it, but there's just so much competition available nearby.

Just had dinner there and it was worth the 45 minute wait. Loved that they took our order before our table was ready. Our food started to arrive within 5 minutes of sitting down. Based on other reviews, we had the clams with basil. I never had clam before and never wanted to try it. I said I would try it here and I loved it. The flavors were fabulous! We had several dishes and all were tasty. Everything tasted very FRESH, even the basil had a "just picked" flavor. Definately a great restaurant to go to with a group.

Went to Newport Seafood for a special occasion. 蔆rowded restaurant, but we got in rather quickly (good timing?). 蔕rdered a set dinner (soup, clams, fish, vegetables, and a chicken dish)...and a medium lobster. 蔜he lobster is their specialty and it definitely was a hit at our table. 蔞ery good, and tasty. 蔐ots of spices...and I think the fact that it is slightly fried makes it that much better. 蔈verything else was good, but the lobster was the highlight. 蔛ervice was great, and our host was very nice. 蔍t was my dad's birthday, and he had a nice time, so that was what counted the most. 蔜he lobster was about 90.00 alone...so that upped the cost of dinner significantly. 蔛o, if you go there, dinner will cost a bit more than your average asian restaurant.

Seen it a dozen times before actually eating there w/ out-of-town friends. Didn't have any expectations but was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was and the reasonable prices (shared aka family style)! 蔋ad the lobster - spicy salt, clams in chili basil, and a couple of other items -- all were very good and even left w/ a doggie bag in hand! Other than the food, the restaurant is actually nicely done, clean, bright -- all the things that assure you of quality of the place! 蔜he bad -- you smell oil, garlic (key ingredients in chinese cooking) when you walk in and you'll walk out smelling like it too! 蔴aha!

I have been eating at this restaurant for over 10 years (before they changed locations). My family has come here for many special occasions and over the years the food is still excellent and service is superb. I would recommend getting here no later than 530p on a weekend if you want to avoid the rush. Their seafood (lobster) is fresh and definitely worth trying. We typically order 4-5 dishes and always leave feeling full and satisfied. The kung pao chicken has cashews and chili peppers and it is sauteed perfectly. The pea sprouts are crisp and delicious, and the fish always cooked to perfection. Shout out to Sophia and her Mother (owner)! If you haven't eaten here yet go and try it, you won't be disappointed!

I go here about every other month and it never lets me down! House special lobster is perfectly flavored and cooked to perfection. Usually go with the steamed rock cod and the elephant clam cooked two ways. the rock cod can get pretty pricey pretty quickly (more expensive than lobster sometimes!) but if you're going to be adventurous definitely roll with the elephant clam (soup and cooked with the bean sprouts).

I recently checked out this Chinese rest. out in San Gabriel and it was the best seafood I had in awhile,. 蔖retty decent selection of 蕋ypical entrees, but You've got to try the fish filet with basil, it's to die for. Pretty decent swanky setup and very reasonable on the prices. I was there for lunch, and my friends and I ordered 4 entrees, and the bill was under 30 bucks. I definitely recommend this place for its quality and very reasonable cost.

The 1 hour wait was totally worth it. We didn't order the lobster but the food we ordered was pretty good. I was really impressed with the Kung Pao Chicken. I never liked Kung Pao chicken and I didn't care too much about it when my husband said he was going to order it. When the dish came I couldnt stop eating it. I think it was my favorite dish. We also had the Beef Loc Loc. That was good. I was surprise how tender the beef was. 蔠e also ordered the Crab. The crab was only okay to us. For that price we expected it to be good. I think the Crab at Seafood Village is much better. The Basil Clam was okay. I guess I'm use to eating Garlic & Black Bean Clams. I forgot what else we ordered. There was 6 of us and we ordered 8 dishes. We finished everything. No leftovers. Service to us was pretty good compared to alot of Chinese Restaurant we've been to. We will definitely go back there if we visit LA again.

Everything I had was delicious. 蔎ust as fast and efficient as an In and Out 蔅urger too. Only reason not 5 stars is I've been there 3 times now and I,as well as everyone with me agreed, 蕋hat since they charge by the pound for the lobster and crab, they over estimate the weight. 蔍 recently met up with some old friends there and most either fished or dove as a hobby and all of us agreed that the lobster served to us did not weigh 5 punds ever in it's lifetime.

If you know me, you'll know that i don't like driving out of my LA boundaries - the only exceptions are for good friends and good food. 蔜his would fall in the latter category. 蔈verytime i go, i think to myself - "damn, this is a far trek" - but the grumpiness (which increases when i have to wait) dissipates once i'm served. 蕋hey seriously have amazing pan-fried, spicy lobsters - they aren't cheap, but better in taste and value than other places, such as Chinois on Main (i think only non-asian people like that place...). 蔵 always wish i had looser clothing or an extra stomach or something so i could cram more food in ... that is how good it is. 蔛ervice is a bit brusque but they know what they are doing in getting people in-and-out, and recommending the best dishes. 蔋ere are my recommendations: 蕇picy, pan-fried lobster; fried squid with salt & pepper; chinese pea sprouts; whole steamed fish. 蔄ll their other food is good too, but if you are only going to be here one time, try the above - you won't regret it. 蔙andom tip: 蔰on't get the boba drink here - it's simply awful. 蔭nyways, why waste your stomach space on that?

We went on a Friday night around 6pm and they were 3/4 full. Whew! Got in just before the rush. We were four people but they sat us down at one of the large tables - slightly awkward- 蔮ut I guess that gave us plenty of table space for the food. We ordered their signature Newport lobster dish, the pepper beef, the fried salt and pepper fish and pea sprouts. All were great, though I've had slightly better lobster in previous times here. I will never stop coming here as there's always some occasion for my family and friends to gather at Newport.

fresh, flavorful, pure flavors. its like opening a fragrant flower (smelling the food). down with their french beer (cuts through the oil). very cheap lunch menu lots of $5 choices and they still give you the requisite orange slices for dessert. order the lobster or crab, oysters or clams with basil, french beef, pea sprouts and crispy noodles with beef and vegetables. those are the dishes i always get. for $35-40 feed a family of 5. second helpings might last you several days unless you finish this delicious food in the first sitting. very popular can get crowded even during lunch. try to go right when it opens or late afternoon.

I wish Yelp had half stars. 蔜his would definitely be a 4.5 star-er. 蔍 went to their old location last year, and it was small, in an old building on the corner of a strip mall. 蔉ood was good. 蔜heir new location is pretty nice. 蔍t's a stand alone building that must have been a Carrows or Baker's Square in a former life. 蔜he interior is very clean and nicely furnished and set up for what's really a mad-grubbin family-style downndirty(in a good way) chinese restaurant. 蔜he service is quick and courteous... the food comes out quickly and hot. 蔍t seemed like most every table ordered the lobster... they have small, medium, and large sizes and I think the lobster is something like $15 a pound? 蔍t comes out sauteed and super-sauced and chopped in the shell, but it's very tasty and easy to extract the meat out. 蔄ll other dishes we got were also very tasty and relatively well priced. 蔜he pictures on Yelp speak louder than my words. I'd recommend this place to anyone.

Where is the lobster's meat? We were charged 5,5lb of lobster but only have a piece of meat. The rest are all legs and head. 蔠here is all the body meat gone? From the size of legs,tail,head and the taste of meat, I can tell the lobster is not more than 2.5 lb. 蔈ven 2.5 lb , we still should have at least 6 pieces of body meat. In stead, we only had one 蔮ody meat �one claw and 16 legs. (usually a lobster should have 2 claws and 8 legs, this one is very different) I avoided to order lobster in Chinese restaurant for many years, 蔮ut this one received such a high raking , I reviewed at least hundred of comments about this restaurant but no one mentioned this problem. So I decided to give it a shot and very disappointed. Another problem is the noise, I can't recall when was the last time I had so much pressure to my ears. Six of us just finished the food as soon as possible and run away from it. Driving time 3.5 hours, waiting 40mins and eating time 55 mins.

Went this past weekend to their new restaurant location, and the improvements are great! I love the new decor and style, the booths and padded sofa-like seats are so comfy and cute, and the dividers are a cute accent. Much better than the old restaurant location. The food is great too! I love their lunch special menu. They have a whole bunch of stuff to choose from at 5-7 bucks a dish! and they're cooked to order, so their super fresh and piping hot when served. And, everything was perfectly seasoned, not overly flavored so you can really taste the seafood. Also, they're super fast too, we ordered 4 dishes and within 5-10 min 3 of them were out in front of us - no kidding! the only thing that took a bit longer was the whole deep fried fish, but that was so worth the wait. They don't use the typical 蕋ilapia-ish fish that every other asian restaurant uses, they have one with more meat on it, it looked kinda like a red snapper but i'm not positive. so yums though. and the waiters are super friendly and quick too. Lunch specials last until 4:45, so if you can grab an early dinner too! I wouldn't recommend going during dinner hours, because then the prices are a lot higher and after paying the cheap lunch special prices, who would want to pay the full dinner prices??

The complete name for this restaurant is Newport Seafood Tan Cang Restaurant, which is what Tan Cang means (Xin1 Gang3 in Mandarin, Sun Kong in Cantonese). My brother clued me in on this restaurant, one of the best in the newer and better Asian districts that have made the downtown LA Chinatown passe. Most of the tables will be having the New Port [sic, it's 2 words on the menu] Special Lobster (Tom Hum Tan Cang Dac Biet), cooked with chopped green onions, various colored chiles and onions stir-fried into the bright red crustacean (note there is another item on the menu called Lobster with ginger and green onion, tom hum xao gung hanh la). Once you're done eating, don't forget to suck the flavor from the shell; you'll know why it's so special. You'll be able to taste the blend of spices, and none of the spices overwhelm each other. Also great is the clams with spicy hot sauce (ngieu xao ot la que), 7.75, seasoned with fresh basil. Their Beef Loc [sic, it's usually luc] Lac (bo luc lac), 9.95, is good, and their use of snow pea leaves is a nice touch, though not the best. But what you should really get here is what you'll see in the huge tanks above your head spanning the wall. Filling those tanks from one end to the other are geoducks aka elephant clams (oc voi voi in Vietnamese, literally meaning elephant clam, Xiang4 ba2 bang4 in Mandarin, and mirugai or mirukui[gai in Japanese, though it is often mistranslated as giant clam, which is actually himejako). Geoduck, pronounced "GOO-wee-duck", (Panopea abrupta or Panope generosa) is not a duck at all, but a species of large saltwater clam, also known as king clam, elephant trunk clam, or the Pacific geoduck clam. The name is derived from a Nisqualli Indian word meaning "dig deep", and its phonetically counterintuitive spelling is likely the result of poor transcription (alternate spellings include gweduck and goiduck). Tan Cang offers Elephant Clam Newport Style (oc voi voi kieu tan cang), and that's what you should order because this is a true example of umami. The menu is impressive, offering 140 items, every item in 4 languages (Chinese, Vietnamese, English, and Thai), plus family combos (headlined in Vietnamese only). Tan Cang is a tourist site (next to Saigon Bridge - Binh Thanh District in Saigon). CASH ONLY.

Sorry...I hate to disagree with the other reviews, but I gotta speak my mind. 蔒y family has been going to Newport for many years, but the past couple of trips have been less than satisfactory meals. 蔠e came for lunch again today. 蔜he hot and sour soup was...well...lukewarm. 蔠hy? 蔍t was strange. 蔜he chunks (tofu, black fungus, or whatnot)were warm, but the soup was cold...so i guess that makes the soup, overall, lukewarm. 蔠e got our usual dishes and everything came out lukewarm. 蔜he kungpao chicken was still tasty and the lobster was mediocre... but compared to other restaurants, Newport definitely falls short now. 蔍 most likely won't be returning.

i came here with my family and some out of town friends last saturday for lunch. apparently this place is pretty famous, even though i'd never heard of it in my 5+ years living in this area. 蕎e were lucky that we did not have to wait for a table, and got seated right away. the entrance way is a little crowded with some giant crab/lobster/fish tanks that were incredible-looking. we ordered the french beef which was pretty good. the meat was very tender and well flavored. the house special lobster (which they recommended we get the "medium" size) was about 4-5 pounds at about $15 per pound. i recommend getting a smaller size, especially if you intend to order a lot of other dishes. we also ordered a fried fish special with a sweet/spicy sauce, which was only ok. 蕋he clam with basil sauce was very good. the waiter we got was pretty knowledgeable and was able to recommend dishes to us. we also ordered a crab asparagus soup that was good, though not as hearty as the seafood soups i see posted on this site. 蕋he pea sprouts were also good, a simple vegetable dish to go along with the rest of the meal. for 6 dishes (including a $80+ lobster) and a soup, the check for 6 adults one child ran about $180 not including tip. i think with a smaller size lobster, the orders and check would have been more proportional to the amount of people we had there and food we actually needed. a good experience, i will definitely go back.

So i've been looking for a place that serves up a great lobster dish to take my girl's parents to for fathers day. I asked my dad, who is a restauranteur himself and he highly recommended a few places in Monterey Park. I decided to check out yelp and found tihs little place with such high ratings. I cant believe my dad forgot about this place. We went on Fathers day, the wait was about 2 hours long. BUT MY oH MY, was the lobster ever worth it. Turns out that the owner of the place is chinese and is a old school mate of my uncle when they all lived back in Vietnam. Which explains why the owners seems to speak like a million differet languages. Anyways, the lobster was definately deserves 5 stars. I had to take a star away because their claim with black bean sauce wasnt up to par as their lobster and their spinach and garlic lacked flavor. Nonetheless, the service was super fast. We were charged for 5 lbs of lobster but i think it was closer to 4 lbs. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years and can tell when something is being slightly exhagerated.I didnt complain since its $15 蔭 lb and i know it is difficult to earn a profit by charging so little for lobster. I will definately go again if im in the rosemead area and hopefully their wont be a mob of people outside ready to attack you for a table. hahah

I think this is the location we went to like almost 3 weeks ago for a b-day party. It was a very long wait, but you know what it was worth it. 蔜his place was jammed packed and it was once a Marie Calendar I think but getting back to the food. This place is a seafood place and known for their Lobster and other seafood goodies. I can't specifically remember everything we ordered but here are spme of what we ordered. We first started off with this cold clam dish which was on a wooden little boat and it had a salt as a dipping sauce. It was pretty yummy just by itself. I'm not much of a clam person myself but I give it a thumbs up. Our next few dishes were a green dish then a Walnut and glazed shrimps then a fish and then abalony which I didn't partake and finally the Lobster which was da'bomb. It was huge and their was plenty of meat to go around for 10 of us. Then their was a meat dish but the meat was over cooked and then a chicken dish for Randall since he is a picky eater a rice dish and then a birthday cake. For a first time restaurant I hardly ever give a 5 star but the food was pretty close to excellent.

My family came here for lunch for my brother's 36th birthday today. I haven't eaten Chinese food in the San Gabriel Valley for years now but I remember growing up with fond memories of the food. 蔜oday did not disappoint. The restaurant is quite beautiful and dare I say swanky for a family style seafood place. We ordered the seafood chow fun, squid with black bean sauce, salt and pepper pork chops, deep fried flounder and salt and pepper shrimp. All the portions were generous. The salt and pepper pork chops were tasty, crunchy and finger licking good. The squid with black bean sauce impressed me. This is the dish where most restaurants skimp on the squid and put tons of filler onions and green peppers. There was an impressive heap of steaming tasty squid and a decent portion of onions and peppers. My dream come true. The salt and pepper shrimp was crunchy and delicious. My brother doesn't even like seafood and he ordered 2 plates of the salt and pepper shrimp. I found the seafood chow fun and the flounder decent though not necessarily outstanding. This place makes me wish I lived in LA.

Do you love seafood? Do you love Chinese & Vietnamese food? Newport is definitely the place for you! This place has an extensive Seafood menu as well as common Chinese and some Vietnamese style dishes as well. They are of course known for their lobster which is stir-fried in a house sauce that gets the flavor into each bite. I've reviewed their other location in Rowland Heights and loved it and when I tried this location which I heard was the original, I still loved it! The decor inside is very contemporary and upscale looking and have plenty of waiters at your service. Food came out fairly quickly when we went and we never had to wait too long for anything. My favorite here is the stir-fried lobster, black bean & also basil clams, basil fillet fish, bo luc lac, and even honey walnut shrimp. Take a look at their extensive menu and be adventurous and not always order the same thing everyone always gets... try something new! Pros: - Extensive menu. - Known for their lobster special. - Plenty of seafood items. - Has common Chinese/Vietnamese dishes. - Clean, modern, well kept, and contemporary decor. - Changed full plates with new plates frequently. Cons: - Usually I would have at least some cons but so far I haven't had a bad experience so if I do I'll update it with it.

My friend drove from La Mirada (20 miles away) to meet me up for dinner at this place - saying she was craving lobster from this restaurant. 蔍 am not a big fan of seafood (don't eat anything with eyes looking back at me on a dish). 蔔ewport Seafood is nicely decorated and the environment is nicer than most Chinese seafood restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley. 蔛he ordered the lobster special and I ordered the French beef cubes... She convinced me to eat the lobster and it was the best lobster dish I ever had (my own mom could not get me to eat this stuff)... afterward I avoided the beef cubes (it was good but not great) and focused on the lobster dish. 蔍f you live in the area and would like to take your family or out of town friends to a lobster place this is the place to go for the best lobster in town. I guess this place is known for its' house special lobster. 蔜he service is excellent. 蔜he French beef cubs were good, but I have had better. 蔜he price for lobster is quite higher than other Seafood restaurants in the area - with some giving free lobster if you order $30 worth of dishes for dinner.

First time to this location. We had one of the family dinner specials: $48 for 5 dishes. (A lot of their dishes are listed as spicy but can be made not spicy.) The food is pretty solid and the decor is nice. Service was good as well. Will definitely go back.

The Bears and i had a hankering for lobster, and so we asked for a tip and received one from a panda who sent us out to San Gabriel -- so we braved the 10 East through downtown, followed a blue ball from Mrs. Bear's iphone map, and arrived at Newport Tan Cang. Since it was only an hour or so before closing on a weekday night, we didn't have to wait for a table and were immediately seated. The service was brisk and all I can really remember now is falling face first into a heaping plate of fresh lobster. Sure, we tried some other dishes -- one vegetable and another with chicken -- they were good -- but the highlight is clearly the lobster. You can pretty much binge on the shellfish here and avoid the fortune that most seafood restaurants will charge you. Warning though that it's awfully messy to eat, and probably tips the sodium scale a little toward the unhealthy side, but really, how often do you eat lobster? New Tan Cang is definitely worth a visit, and we're heading back for more...

Lobster was great, crab was good, french-style beef was ok. Food is pretty good and service was great overall. The only thing I don't like about this place is that they don't take reservations. I had a party of 11 for my husband's birthday celebration Friday night and we waited there for almost an hour to be seated. Just an fyi that the Rowland Heights location takes reservations and their food and service are just as great. I recently heard about this new place in San Gabriel so I had to try it.

I'm two days shy of this review, but here it is...This place rocked my world! 蔍 chose this place- largely based on Yelp reviews, to celebrate my birthday and to all you Yelpers Thank You, you hooked me up! 蔒y respects to the chef and to that amazing lobster that made our night. We had the 8 course meal and we added the lobster. 蔒an o Man this place delivers, the food was 蔵ncredible; savory, flavorful, genorous portions- leaving you wanting more...but the Lobster..there are just no words that can explain. 蔜o put in perspective- if I knew that i was going to check out of this world, my last meal would be that damn lobster. This is a proper way to enjoy a Lobster- Newport, CA, Marina del Rey,CA, San Francisco, CA... you all have nothing on this joint--- from San Gabriel, go figure. Anyhow, I can keep going but you can only understand it- if you try it yourself. 蔣ou will NOT be disappointed. 蔉elipe (Phillip) thanks for accommodating my family in the private room for my birthday celebration and Mr. Guapo- thank you for making my birthiday dinner one to remember. To all the employees at Newport Tan Can- Thank You!

Great place for Chinese/Vietnamese seafood. 蔍 just recently had dinner there with family after a long absence and was pleased with their new decor and food. 蔜heir last location was cramped and sticky. 蔒ust haves...lobster/crab/kung pao chicken/french beef cubes. 蔄dded bonus, they always end your dinner with sliced oranges.

This seafood here is amazingly fresh and delicious. 蔇efinitely one of those places worth the drive even if you live in West L.A. 蔜he lobster is probably some of the best crustacean I've ever had (even though a bit pricey). 蔛teamed fish was also very impressive. 蔈njoyed the shaking beef as well.

Yes...gotta get the lobster. This is their signature dish...you can't miss out on it. 蔜hey only take cash...so make sure you have 蔱nough of it...cause their lobster is about $15+ per pound and you have to get one that's at least a 4 pounder to have enough meat to go around if your with the family, sometimes we have to get two lobsters. Also, I would show up a bit earlier before the dinner rush...it wait can be an hour or more.

Worst service we've ever seen. 蔠aiters kept bringing wrong dishes to our table and forgot to bring our orders. 蔄fter our dishes finally arrived, we found sand in two dishes. �I almost lost half of my tooth. �We order the crab, but it tastes just okay with too much MSG. 蔜his restaurant is way over-rated. 蔍f you don't mind to eat dirty & over-priced food, you should try this place out.

those who say this place is awesome are right. 蔭 lot of good chinese seafood places are dives, with awful parking and hostile service. 蕋his place is NOT like that. 蔲irst of all the food is great, i ate the lobster, house special style, the french beef, beef chow fun ,and clams. �medium" lobster was a huge 6 lb. 蔯lams were very juicy. �service was excellent, they had a parking attendent/security guard to referee the parking lot. 蔮athrooms were clean and did not make you want to throw up. 蕎aiter was helpful and friendly. 蔮tw the DO take credit cards. 蔵 went on a sunday night, 6:00 pm, and the place was full, but we were seated right away.

Definitely one of the 蔮est Chinese restaurants in Los Angeles, which is saying a lot considering how many there are! 蔍 like their new location - 蔍 can actually take friends there without having to apologize for the place beforehand. 蔔ot everything on their menu is worht trying, but I highly recommend the folloiwng: 蔿obster, crab, house French beef, mussels with mint leaves, and fried tofu. 蔕h, and their prices are actually quite reasonable, especially if you go for lunch.

I must admit the food is quite good here and it is all reasonably priced. 蔐ike most people, my favorites are the lobster and the French Beef. 蔋owever, I called to ask a few questions one afternoon and the guy who answered the phone had some difficulty understanding me as English was his second language. 蔄fter a while, I think he became frustrated and then just hung up. 蔐ame. 蔊o for the food, not the service.

Read up on this and decided to take a dining group here last night. Here's a great restaurant for taking guests. Their private rooms are quieter, spacious, divided by dark Chinese carved lattice mahogony. The very classy table was graced by etched glass lazy susan. This is a white-tablecloth- linen -napkin kind'a place and we were more than comfortable with really good service. How good? They changed our plates at least 4 times. It's hard to believe this is in the old Marie Calendar's building. For those of you who wish to return and duplicate our menu, here it is -or of what I can remember. I selected it with the help of Phillip, the manager who speaks very good English. We started with braided crab and fish maw soup. This was a very thick, mild flavored soup. I would have preferred something much spicier. It's the only item I would not go back for. The house lobster ($15.99 @ lb.) was in a delicious spicy sauce. We wanted larger, but we got a 5 �/2 pounder and could have eaten more. But we ordered 9 dishes. So much more to come. We used our fingers, and slurped on the delicious shell after the lobster meat was devoured. I would also suggest this dish with crab instead. It's easier to break open a crabshell. Beef cubes French style was a tasty balance to our menu, since we had so much fish. The filet was tender, in a dark savory sauce served over sliced onions. There was a nice balance going on. The large fried black trout has a most impressive presentation. Big hit - all kept going back for more, searching each nook and cranny for more meat and lucious scallion sauce. Clams in basil sauce were excellent. The clams were on the large side and the basil was added at the last minute so they were fragrant and fresh tasting. We wanted to add a chicken dish and on recommendation we ordered Kung Pao. It was fine Kung Pao, but I think that next time will replace it with something more adventurous. The house vegetable dish was a very mild, Cantonese style of mixed vegetables. Too bland for my taste. We needed to amp up the flavor. The Pork Chop was a dish of crispy fried strips of pork that looked tough but was tender and not in a sauce - kids would love this dish. This was, in fact, a finger-food kind of meal, and more than once I accidentally allowed my fingers to linger on my lips for an extra taste of great sauces. Their dessert menu was lacking. 蔍t only had a selection of sweet tapioca beverages. 蔜he tab was $260 incl tax, tip, 2 beers & $10 corckage (party of 10). On my foodie-driving scale of 0 -10 miles I give this a 20. Because its 20 miles from my house and I would go back again if you invite me.

UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SWINDLED BY THE SMOOTH TALKING, SHADY LADY OWNER, DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT. My girlfriend and I came here for the 1st time and it will be the last!!! The owner recommended us to get the most expensive item on the menu and DID NOT TELL US THE PRICE NOR TELL US THAT THE MINIMUM ORDER FOR THE ELEPHANT CLAMS WAS 3.5 LBS, WHICH CAME OUT TO OVER $80 WHEN WE GOT THE BILL!!!! no clams are worth that much for 2 people and it left a nasty fishy aftertaste in our mouths. I complained to the same lady owner that we were not made aware of the minimum order and she flat out LIED to us that she did tell us about the minimum order!!!! We felt so apalled and shocked that such a successful restaurant would use such shady methods to swindle their customers. Unless you have 3hours to spare to eat and money to throw away, do not go to this place!!! There's plenty of better, honest places around this neighborhood!!!

i'm a fan of these restaurants. they have 2 locations. i always go to the Rowland Heights location. The waiters are very friendly and courteous unlike typical Chinese restaurants. 蔜ry House special lobster, lobster sashimi, geoduck clam sashimi, French beef, kang poa chicken, and steam fish. You wont be disappointed!
