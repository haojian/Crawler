Hmmm I'm sad that I didn't enjoy this as much, and my party of 4 agrees. Everything was subpar and the sake they recommended wasn't great. Note: I'm not a sake drinker. Usually staff at other places make the right recommendations for me, after hearing my likes and dislikes, but sadly i didn't enjoy it as much. My friends didn't enjoy their sake recommendations either. KARAAGE: okay, not as crispy and tender as other places SAIKORO STEAK: the only great dish here that made me go yummm. EBI SHINJO: sounds great on paper, but didn't taste great. pretty plain taste. CHAWANMUSHI: pretty decent, but not the best FLUKE CARPACCIO: should have gotten sashimi instead MAGURO TARTAR: i like my tartar a certain way (simple and with avocado and some sauce that would blend the flavor well), so i'm pretty picky. my friends liked it, but it was too much for me. I didn't even take a picture because it looked too much for me lol. TORI TSUKUNE: not as good as aburiya kinnosuke. JAGA DANGO: never tried something like this for me, but it was good some steak dish you grill on a rock: fun and good but proportions are sooo small. Dessert: very meh. we had two desserts to share. Ice cream and some cake.. not sure what we got though. but very forgettable. I even forgot we had dessert (till I uploaded my pictures and had to re edit this post) and that does not simply happen... The ambiance is pretty nice and there is always a crowd/packed. So there's that mood where you just want to drink. The toilets were fun too (heh) and I had a hard time finding it lol. But it's near the front in this hut looking shelter (looks cooler than it sounds). Since Sakagura has such high reviews, i would want to come again and try different dishes and sake. But as of now it's a 3.5 stars restaurant for me.

Sakagura has undoubtedly been my favorite restaurant ever since my buddy took me here for my birthday four years ago. There is an unmistakable allure to this place, from its status as a hidden gem, to its decor and its ambiance, and finally to the fact that you really can't go wrong with any of their food. It is one of those rare places where every experience of mine has been flawless. When I go here for dinner, I usually find that eight of their surprisingly filling tapas-style dishes are enough to serve two people. I always get the same four dishes* and then another four that are relatively new to me. Dessert to top things off is a must. For the non-drinkers, dinner without sake will run two people about $100 in total; those who do drink will probably pay anywhere from $120-150. Since my first visit, I've gone no fewer than ten times, with friends, and lady friends, for first dates (and last). I will conclude by saying this: if you're looking for a place where you can show off your expertise with chopsticks to a date, Sakagura is it; order the fluke carpaccio, which comes with plenty of itty bitty salmon roe. *Here follows the 4-dish core of each of my Sakagura experiences: 1. KAMO ROAST: Slices of Chilled Roasted Duck Wrapped Around Scallion Accented with Basil Sauce; 2. FLUKE CARPACCIO: Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe, and Shiso Leaf; 3. BUTA KAKUNI: Sakagura's Special Stewed Diced Pork 4. SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU: Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso (Eggyolk, Spinach, and Sweet Red)

So delicious! Super random location but fantastic decor and ambiance once you make it downstairs into the restaurant, which makes it into a great date spot. Love that you can try tons of different tapas style dishes. This place is suitable for the adventurous types. We really liked the IKA SHIOKARA, SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU and UZAKU. The portions are small so you can have a taste of lots of different flavors.

For lunch only: This is my favorite place to go if I have time on Friday for a proper lunch. Reservations are highly recommended if there is more than 1 eating. If it's not available on OpenTable - try calling. They hold tables for 10 minutes max. If you need to be connected 24/7, know that not every spot has wireless coverage. I'm obsessed with the jewel oke bento because I love the combination of sashimi, some rice, tempura, eel, yams, etc. The quality is worth the $20. They also had a ridiculous sounding uni entree, but it sounded too rich that day to whet my appetite. There is something for everyone on the menu. I had to take a star off for the service though. If you sit at the bar (which is mostly for walkins and solo diners), it can take FOREVER to flag down someone to get you your check. I also had to wait 30+ minutes for my lunch once...

Nice place!!! We waited for about 10 minutes for a table at 11PM on a Saturday night, and it's totally fine. We didn't order any food but just some sake. They have about two hundred types to choose from, divided by how polished it is. If you go in a group I'd recommend try the semi-dry one, warm instead of cold. They can make it half bottle or 250ml. A little bit expensive, but come on, here everything's not cheap, and the location is great, friendly service!

Sakagura.... I gotta tell you . ?I've kind of avoided this spot because it feels like a run-of-the-mill japanese sushi joint. ? it is located on the basement floor of a ordinary building, a couple of friends convinced me we had to try it out. So we did. Our waitress spoke really poor English. ?She had a hard time understanding what we were saying so we had to point and she wrote down the order. ?Unfortunately, our order was mixed up. ?We didn't make a fuss just moved on. ?We ordered cocktails which were way tooooo sweet. yuck! ? The matche green tea was decent but it was scathing hot so be careful. ?I really like the Asian style bathrooms kinda unique. ? Prices were standard NYC flair. ?Our dishes were really good even though our waitress mixed some of them up. ?One of the dishes we did eat was the pork belly miso beef stew. Which was tender and extremely fatty (felt my arteries literally clog may need a cardiac catheterization afterwards, lol!). I'm not sure that this is my go to spot but I was impressed with the variety of items and the quality of the food. One of the few times you leave a Japanese restaurant ?feeling satisfied... and don't need to eat again in an hour.

Not much hasn't been said about this spot, which is one of my favorite izakayas. ?I recently made two new discoveries. ?My friends and I ordered the grilled oysters which was a special for the night. ?Usually don't like cooked oysters but this was really good and the presentation was beautiful. ?I also found a new obsession--Yuzu Omoi Sake which is refreshing, fragrant, and slightly sweet.

I've been to Sakagura a few time and it's one of the places that I take out of town guests to.Food quality is good, good flavor and reasonable prices for New York. Pork belly- must get, meatis very tender and very flavorful Sashimi- Very fresh and good quality Uni noodle soup- not much an uni fan, but this was delicious and the taste just grows on you Cod- great flavor and cooked perfectly, meat was still tender MAGURO NATTO - refreshing dish Dessert- Sesame option, yummy and make sure you save room for it!

Service was excellent could not ask for anything more. However the food was mediocre at best. This place serves small portions of food like a Spanish tapas bar. No problem here. But the quality of the food was nothing special. The pork belly (their signature dish) was mainly fat. ?And while some may find the basement quaint is more dungeon like than cava.

This is a really awesome, truly unique, one of a kind place. Came here with a friend for dinner--frend ordered two small plates and I ordered a salmon sashmi in a bowl of rice, which came with miso soup. Dishes were very fresh and excellently prepared, albeit on the smaller portions side. I personally wouldn't call the food "stellar," but it's definitely delicately prepared. Based on food alone this place would probably get a 3.5, but it's really the ambiance and decor that gives it the 5 it deserves. The ambiance here is honestly unrivaled. The place is super hard to find on the outside because you need to walk through a residential-looking building. Then you walk down two flights of really sketchy (but wide) stairs and when you enter it's like WHOA you're on a different planet. It's really voodoo and cultish in a way, but the atmosphere is super relaxing and unique.

Definitely a must try if only for the Black Sesame creme brule. Really fun location in the basement of an office building (where is my date taking me?!) Service was wonderful and the small plates were a wonderful way to try several delicious "tapas." Notably, the Pork Belly and the Beef tongue were SO savory and perfectly textured. I could eat those all day. The Fluke was also amazing (topped with Salmon Roe). Simple yet full of flavor. The Tuna tartar, spinach (sesame flavored!) and onigiri were nothing to write home about but only because everything else was so much better, not because they weren't good. Definitely a sweet date spot, but the restaurant is spacious so I can envision a comfortable larger party as well. AND with the small but surprisingly filling dishes, there's room for dessert. DEFINITELY get the black sesame creme brule. You will not be disappointed!

This. Place. Is. ?Awesome!! I wasn't sure what to expect. ?it's very rare, IMO, to find a purely **Japanese** restaurant, that doesn't solely cater to the sushi crowd. ?They have lots of small plates, and lemme tell you...it was ALL GOOD. ? First, my friend invited about 7 of his closest buds (myself included) for a night of sake and Japanese food. ?He took us into this basement shady looking place, that basically I thought we'd need a password or secret handshake to get in. ?WE didn't. ?But you should have a reservation for sure for larger parties. ? We had some of the best sake I've ever had in my life. ?I'm not giant fan of Sake, and some of it can be an off-flavor or bitter. ?We had a dryer one and a sweeter one to split. They were both so good that we could not decide between the two. ? Then the small plates. ?Oh Em GEEEE. We had some deep fried tofu, which I'm used to some of the sweeter tofu (with a peanut sauce or sweet and sour sauce to dip), but this had a more savory mushroom sauce. ?It was very good. ?Their pork belly is considered one of the best things on the menu. I'm not a HUGE fan of pork belly unless it's bacon. But this was good. ?I probably wouldn't order it again, but it was good. ? I took a look at the deep fried mashed potatoes (you read that right). ?They were deep fried in DONUT BATTER. ?Uh, what the heck? ?You wouldn't think they go together but they are like two birds and a feather. ?Not a state fair item? Should be. ? The shrimp balls w/ almond crust was a little overpowering with the almonds. Good, but would have liked more of a shrimpy flavor. We all had complimentary tea at the end of the meal. ?No one got dessert...because we were all too full!! You won't break the bank coming here. Man. I live on the Upper West Side. ?Getting to 3rd Ave in midtown is not easy. ?But I'll definitely bring my passport and go through customs to get here again. ?It was fab.

This is a mysterious Japanese restaurant that will transport you to Japan. ?It's hard to find, but I was introduced to this place by someone "in the know." ? When I want the serious sushi stuff, I go across the street to Yasuda. ?But when I want to go to Japan, I come here. ?There are so many items on the menu, you sort of have to sample them all. ?It's like Japanese tapas. ?Everything I've had here was amazing, and hard to describe. ?They also have a tremendous selection of sake. ?And service here is first-rate. The only time I was disturbed here was when a group of white people came and sat next to us and made a ton of noise. ?Just remember that when you come here, be ready to be transported to Japan, and enjoy the place!

Sakagura is a little hard to find - it's in the basement of an office building and you don't get very good service down there, so if you are meeting someone who may be lost I would wait upstairs. ?I came here for dinner with one of my professor's from college who was in town. ?The restaurant is really authentic, from the food and decor to the electronic toilets in the bathrooms! ?They gave us a big table, so it is good for groups and business dinners. ?We didn't really know what to order but everything came out great! ?I recommend reading other reviews before you go to get food suggestions!

The best way I can describe this is Japanese Tapas. I couldn't read the menu (because its hardly in English) but the food was alright. The service was pretty good but I'm pretty sure our table was the only group of white people in the restaurant. So its very authentic...I'll give them that. Its in kind of a weird spot in this random midtown basement but they've certainly decorated it nicely. Overall I had just an OK experience but I dont think I'll be coming back.

Came here for a family dinner, and got to try a bunch of dishes. Was not really impressed with the flavors and quality of the dishes, with the exception of the black sesame creme brulee which was out of this world! The kamo roast (sliced duck with scallion and basil sauce) was not particularly tasty, but should've been, given it came in such small portions... I also didn't find the sea urchin over soba noodles to be a particularly fresh dish (did not compare at all to Yasuda's sea urchin). My sister did enjoy the sake oyako don (salmon sashimi and roe over rice), and that was a good size and filling from what she said. Overall, not very impressed for the hype this place has. Seating is also a bit cramped; it's a huge place but they really do try to fit in as many tables as possible. My grandma kept on knocking over this temporary bamboo screen that the waiters had put up in order to create a weak semblance of privacy for two tables that were too close to each other.

I was very impressed by the quality of food at Sakagura. Everything was perfectly seasoned, impeccably served, and really delicious. The coffee jello dessert and the other desserts are a must try, simply amazing! I love trying Japanese dishes and straying from the usual sushi roll or sashimi plate, and Sakagura offers the perfect variety of small plates to indulge in. To me the portion sizes were generous/adequate and prices were fair. Can't wait to go back already!

This restaurant is definitely for those in the know - fortunately I was with someone who was... how else would I have located this basement restaurant in a random office building' in Midtown? Walking down the stairs and hallways normally dedicated to HVAC and conduits, the only evidence of a Japanese restaurant were a few silk screens and a discreet sign next to the entrance. Though walking through the entrance, our surroundings were completely transformed. The inside was trimmed with bamboo and adorned with demure, authentic Japanese fabrics and decorations. Our waitress was very helpful and navigated us through the extensive sake list. She chose a sake that was both fruity and dry, it was delicious... I only wish I could remember the name... I would order it again. We started with the tofu salad, the tofu was soft and flavorful and played well with the lettuce and miso dressing. We also got the fluke sashimi with olive oil, eat bite was perfection and the taste combinations were delightful. I would definitely order both again. The ebi sticks are a must, I really different way to serve summer rolls. The tamago with eel was okay, not our favorite, it was a cold dish, so the texture was a little off. Also the shredded beef, while cooked perfectly, was not unique or memorable. We also had the eggplant with bonita flakes, very good. Dessert is a must - our waitress recommended the black sesame creme brulee, not something I would normally order, but it was amazing. We saw the chef making the dessert at the bar and the focus and artful way he was firing the brulee, I knew it would be amazing, it was, the flavor of the black sesame was unique and not too sweet. Would definitely go back... next time will make reservations, it was getting packed and we left at 10!

Deep beneath the crust of the Earth lies Sakagura...an underground oasis of Japanese awesomeness - just be ready to answer three riddles and cross a rope bridge to get here! ?(But seriously, pay close attention to the street address or you'll wind up in either (a) the sushi place next door, or (b) nowhere/an office building) After almost coming here with a fellow Yelp-Elite, I found myself with another hungry foodie also ready to partake in the tasty small plates offered at Sakagura! ?We split six selections between two of us: Ika Shiokara - A small plate of sliced raw squid in a salty squid liver marinade. ?Although small, this is still good to split, as I would have probably found it too overwhelming in both salt and bitterness to down the entire thing myself. Hiyayakko - My friend chose this and ate most of it, but I managed to have a couple of bites. ?She really liked it, but I was indifferent (I'm not a big tofu fan to begin with so don't listen to me!) ?I did enjoy the crunch from the grated ginger and scallion flakes though. Sake Oyako Don - This was a bit larger than the first two, and one of my favorites. ?Fresh strips of salmon and salmon roe (eggs) with soy sauce was served over a half-sphere of sushi rice. ?The salmon was delicious and soft, and had nice stripes/marbling of the fat layers. ?The miso soup that comes with this was unnecessary, but definitely welcomed. ? Buta Kakuni - We ordered two of these, and, as others have described, this stewed pork is melt-in-your-mouth delicious! ?Along with the salmon, this was also a standout dish. ?I highly recommend getting this, especially since it's small enough to "squeeze in" with other choices. Kama Roast - Slices of chilled duck wrapped scallion with basil sauce. ?This was good, but not as good as the others. ?It's also $10, but a decent portion for the price. Onsen Tamago - Sea urchin and soft boiled egg in cold soup - This was delicious, but definitely an acquired taste (sea urchin is very soft). ?Even though this is a soup, it's still very "splittable" - chunks are small enough without doing too much cutting/piercing. With their exhaustive menu, I'll definitely be coming back again, but I'm thrilled we managed to conquer some great land and sea-based offerings on the menu. ?Service was friendly and expedient to boot, and they also have a legendary saki menu, although we stuck to beers.

I came to Sakagura once a long while ago, and I'm glad I came back recently. I didn't remember much of my first visit but just that I had loved the food. My friend and I wanted sake and we were nearby Sakagura. We ordered several plates to share between three people and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Ponzu hirame - fresh and direct, just exactly what I was craving. Tamago yaki - not just egg but had other things too, which added flavors and textures and I enjoyed it. Chawanmushi - this was one of my favorite of the night. The egg was cooked just right and I loved the sauce. Pork belly - the skin part melted in my mouth, so scrumptious. Salmon and roe - over rice. Yummy and fresh. Kani gohan - crab meat with rice. The rice was sticky and flavorful, another favorite of the night for me. I had such a delicious meal here, and I have many more items I'd like to try one day.

I didn't know what to expect because I never have very good food experiences based on what I pay, but this place really took me by surprise.

Very cool place. Excellent service, and the food was good too. It's hidden deep underground -- no cell service (which can be a great thing). I went by myself and sat at the bar. It gave me a lot of time to think and observe, and I was better for the experience, without having to glance at my phone every few minutes. Excellent saki selection. Agedashi tofu was fantastic. Perfect size. I had the Akira noodle dish (hot). Very simple, very good. The two together however, was too much, in my opinion. The noodles fill you up quickly. And so cheap! I'm a fan. Can't wait to come back, this time, not alone.

Sakagura is one of my all time favorite izakayas, ever! The restaurant itself is a little hidden. ?It's in the building that's immediately west from the Central Parking System car park. ?During normal operating hours, there will be a nice little sign set up outside to give you a little clue as to where you might find this little gem. ?Once in the basement, the room opens up into a beautifully decorated restaurant with Japanese decor, including pillars with cherry blossoms sprouting out of them. Now the sake list they have here is amazing. ?I'm not too knowledgeable about sakes in general and always ask for a recommendation for specials or seasonal offerings. ?But what I really want to write about, is the food. ?Oh the food... Ika shiokara, shiromi nanban, tofu salad, hirame ponzu, buta kakuni, gindara yuan yaki, ?sake oyako don.. just to name a few of the things I really love. ? The tofu salad's a must. ?The tofu is chilled and and put on top of some vegetables with a miso dressing. ?Its perfect for sharing, fresh, and delicious. ? Next for the raw offerings. ?The ika shiokara is great. ?It's cured squid in a squid liver marinade which definitely is not for everyone but I can't get enough. ?The hirame ponzu is fluke sashimi served with grated daikon with ponzu sauce (citrus soy sauce). ?Lastly the shiromi nanban is not exactly raw but fried pieces of fish w/ perfectly julienned vegetables in a vinegar-y sauce. Now for the more substantial parts of the meal. ?The buta kakuni. ?Done so well here. ?It's large pieces of pork belly stewed in a soy sauce based liquid. ?If you like pork belly, don't share this one, just get your own. ?The gindara yuan yaki is yet another amazing dish. ?It is fillets of cod cooked perfectly in a sweet soy sauce. ?The fish is so delicate and soft. ?I could eat this one everyday. ?Finally, I really do like the sake oyako don. ?It's rice topped with salmon eggs and salmon sashimi with a soy sauce. ?To be honest, it is not all that special but it is done so well and comes with miso soup, a perfect way to finish the meal. You can't go wrong at Sakagura. ?Try it all, go wild, leave happy!

This is a review for dinner. *tip: make reservations! It was pretty packed, even for a sunday night *tip: go to the toilet. They have the japanese toilets, so the seats were heated, and you can do all sorts of things like wash your ass. I wouldn't recommend washing your ass though because the next person waiting in line would have to wait forever. The dishes aren't that big, you might need quite a few to feel fulll. Now let's talk about food: -Homemade "nihachi" soba: We waited forever for this dish. Maybe the guy who was making it was tired or lazy. It was delicious though. They do not have sobayu at dinner time, only during lunch time. -Seaweed salad: can't go wrong with this. The seaweed (kaiso) tasted great with the sour vinaigrette dressing -Hirame ponzu: think slices of fish that were slightly sour. Amazing. -Fluke carpacio: not as good as the hirame ponzu. This dish came with salmon roe though, that was good. -Chikuzen Ni: one of my favorite dishes. Tender chicken cooked with vegetables- lotus, gobo, carrots etc. -Surumeika Yaki: I've never had squid cooked to such tender perfection. The tentacles looked scary though, so I did not eat those tentacles. They also have a daily special menu with a good selection of dishes.

This must be a New York thing. ?Tried to find this place while on business in NY. ?Ended up at Soba Totto (because it's the exact same address!). ?But no one will tell you that, because that's not cool. ?Sakagura is like the speakeasy of restaurants. You have to be in the know, you know, daddy-o? ?But you can also do like us and stand out front where you think it should be, and yell at each other for 10 minutes that the other person is wrong. ?That works up an appetite. So I give it 4 stars for just causing us so much pain to find. ?Because I am convinced it doesn't exist. But the food was great - in my mind. ?Happy hunting!

I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. In short, it is expensive, well made Japanese food served tapas style so that your mouth can have multiple relationships at the same time. I love when the ambiance of a restaurant matches the food that they serve. Cannot describe how many times a beautifully decorated restaurant with snobby waitresses and teetering crowd are eating and -pretending- to enjoy mediocre food that is plated "pretty". Sakagura is located in the basement of a commercial building with a doorman who points to the door automatically as you walk in. I guess he can recognize a hungry person when he sees one. And as you progress downstairs, you are greeted by a friendly hostess and traditional Japanese decor. Recommend reservations! My date and I had a reservation, but the couple behind us did not and was quoted an hour plus wait. Most memorable dishes: Daikon salad - While I love daikon, this is a dish I recommend you skip. Basically it's raw daikon with mayo. I could not really taste the spicy cod fish roe part of the mayo. Buta Kakuni - Stewed pork was tender, juicy, and melted in the mouth. Order. Agedashi Tofu - Flavorful tofu, with a great soy sauce infused broth that tasted like a serving of sukiyaki on a cold winter night. Ebi Shinjo - Interesting to eat almonds covered fried shrimp balls, unfortunately this combination did not work well. Almonds kept on falling off, so you were left with a very greasy shrimp ball. Chinatown dim sum does it so much better. Onsen Tamago - Great combination of runny yolk with sea urchin and roe. Definitely enjoyed certain elements of my dinner. Not every dish was a winner, but there were enough good ones that lead me to want to come here again. Presentation and service were excellent. Just avoid those almond shrimp balls.

I have mixed feelings about this place. I don't know if it was because I got too hyped up reading all the reviews before going here but I was definitely a little underwhelmed. Some parts were amazing. The atmosphere. It's beautiful and mysterious (due to the lack of natural light). The bathrooms! So adorable! They're shaped like a sake barrel and there's even a little table and chair instead with the super awesome japanese toilets. The onsen tamago. Delicious. How our dinner napkins were always refolded every time my boyfriend or I got up to use the bathroom. And some parts were not as amazing. I know this is a take your time to eat kind of place but we were still missing a dish (the uni soba, which we ended up just canceling) over 1.5 hours into dinner. It's sad because I was really looking forward to it. Also two of specials (washu-gyu on hot stone & grilled oysters) were sold out--at 7pm! Two of the things we wanted the most too. Other than that, nothing was that amazing. Service was just normal. It's hard to flag down a server--they're always so busy going back and forth. But our waters and tea were always refilled and requests always remembered. The food, too, was nothing amazing--you basically get whatever you read on the menu. We had the onsen tamago, tuna tartar, beef tongue, pork kakuni, jidori chicken, daikon salad, and grilled miso gindara (yeah a little too much food for two people). The onsen tamago was the standout. The best. The others were just--OK. The tuna tartar was kind of bland--the sturgeon caviar had no flavor. The pork belly is the same everywhere and is done better at a real Chinese restaurant. The jidori (free range) chicken was very gamey--not my thing and really, it's just grilled chicken, man. Daikon salad had no flavor--not even spicy mayo can save it. The beef tongue had flavor, but not my thing either. The grilled cod was good, but just like any miso cod everywhere else. I guess what I'm trying to say is that--I was expecting, I don't know, a little more than average and so I was disappointed. The food is cooked well and fresh but not amazing or adventurous to the tastebuds. BUT. The dessert. We shared the "spicy ume (plum) sake sorbet & jelly". Now THAT'S creative and adventurous. It's spicy but so sweet and refreshing. I can't even describe the taste and experience of it--it's like nothing else. Definitely try it!

I dine at a different Japanese place in Midtown east once a week for lunch, and Sakagura is as good as it gets. ?I ordered a special with herring and soba, and the herring was fresh and fishy in that herring way, and the soba was as good as the specialty places around here. ?The miso soup was excellent, in the top 10 miso soups I've had, and the sushi was almost as good as the top sushi places in town. ?All in all a great experience. And then I went in for the izakaya. ?Even better. ?If there's a better izakaya in NYC, I haven't found it yet. ?I could go here every week and be happy. ?The dishes are varied, flavorful, and quite inexpensive The decor is memorable, with the underground den of sake adding flavor to the experience. ?As others have commented, it's quite a trip into the underbelly of a office building to get there, but to be honest that just adds to the charm. Unfortunately, I have no sophistication when it comes to Sake, but I am told it is excellent.

Ika shiokara: SALTY squid greatness! I cannot believe that after all these years, the way to enjoy very salty food was to pair it with a nice bottle of sake. Assortment of fresh sashimi: uni, otoro, salmon, hamachi and a 5th I forgot. Onsen tamago: deliciousness...really tough to beat soup with uni, soft boiled egg, and salmon roe. Please order it. Buta kakuni: nice chunk of stewed pork belly. good firm texture in a slightly oversalted broth. Again, another salty dish that is good with sake. Black sesame creme brulee: yum. Pear millefeuille: yum, but not as yum as the creme brulee. No rolls available. Sorry gringos.

What an under-ground treasure... my favorite restaurants on the entire planet Earth. Would still be my favorite even if its $10-30 more expensive per person. Unlike Morimoto or Nobu, this place serves authentic Japanese food. If you have a better taste for fusion food, please go visit the other 2 I mentioned. The dishes that I always order: Fluke Carpaccio Tamagoyaki Ikura Oroshi ? Gyu Miso Nikomi Gyutan Yawaraka Ni They used to serve a rice bowl with Kimchi and raw Tuna (forgot the name), it was amazing!! Too bad its no longer available. I also like the soba here, tastes really fresh and smooth. The $50+ tasting dish with 5 different types of fishes is another killer, they come in 3 pieces of each. I would recommend it for at least a party of 3 people.

After a previous review of this restaurant was plagiarized, I've decided to make this review less plagiarizable (by a heterosexual female reviewer at least) and have compared dishes at Sakagura to actresses. I apologize if I offend anyone. Buta Kakuni - Mmm...you're like Minka Kelly? To keep this review PG-13, let's just say that my lips and tongue action stimulating your soft underside made for some explosive chemistry! My taste buds were going wild by 1-2 combo of looks and taste. Your smooth skin.... Your gentle tan line... Your brief, but memorable acting spot in (500) Days of Summer that saved everyone from Zooey Deschanel's awful acting. But, I digress. You're hot. And tasty. And totally worth coming to Sakagura for. Tori Tsukune- You're like Kate Upton. You have big jugs. But, that's sort of it. There's no depth to your massive, big jugs. Just like these meatballs, they're neither terribly novel nor interesting. The teriyaki sauce isn't terribly sweet, but it doesn't explode in your mouth either. Chawanmushi - The average girl, but marketed and priced like a B-list actress. I call you Aubrey Plaza. Rashida Jones (or ANN PERKINS!) is so much hotter, she's a HAA-vard grad and she was on Freaks and Geeks, but for some strange reason, you're the geek platoon's goddess. Steamed egg custard with bits of chicken, shrimp, and mushrooms is interesting, but I was expecting a heck lot more at $9. Not much value: shrimp, one chicken, one large mushroom, and bits of scallions and other random vegetables. Commoner food, but priced to compete with the other B-list dishes. Toilet- The toilet rocks. Japanese bidet function. I'll admit, I used it. And it felt really good having warm water squirting my privates and making them all clean. However, I couldn't find a warm dryer feature so I walked around with water soaking my undies-- not my proudest moment. There's only 1 men's room and 1 women's room. So be considerate when taking a deuce and don't get too involved in reading the financial section.

Sakagura was ... pretty good. ?The Mister and I ordered the radish salad, the tofu salad, the rich stewed pork, one chawanmushi and shared a sashimi platter. ?We wanted some "different dishes" and didn't want to be weighed down with anything deep fried (as much as we love tempura). ?Both salads were exceedingly fresh and had unique flavors. ?For example, the tofu salad had bits of preserved vegetable and the tofu salad had roe in the mayo dressing. ?The sashimi was surprisingly excellent; my favorite was the uni, which had a rich, sweet flavor. ?We asked the waitress to select some sake for us. ?I don't remember what we had (doh! forgot to write the name down), but it was really lovely, not too sweet, super smooth and beautifully presented. ?Service was decent. ?I didn't notice the decor much, besides that it was a huge cavernous space, which I actually don't like so much. ?The restaurant is subterranean, and you have to go through an office building to get to it. ?Why only three stars you ask? ?Though I don't usually make note of stuff like this, some of the customers were really, really obnoxious. ?You know the type? ?The "I lived in Japan for a month so now I think I know everything about Japanese culture" type? ?Yeah, there were a lot of those people. ?Overall, we had an enjoyable time.

i can't believe this place got 4.5 stars on yelp. this place was JUST OKAY. i've been to yasuda across the street, and aburiya kinnosuke only a short distance away and both BLEW MY MIND, so i had huge expectations coming into this dinner. i'm going to sum up my review in a sentence before diving into the details: if i had to pay the same price for this meal and had to choose between this place and aburiya kinnosuke, i would go back to AK in a heartbeat. i will probably never come back here again....it was underwhelming. why? first of all, this place was a pain in the ass to get a table at. the first time i tried to have dinner here, the hostesses told us there was going to be an hour+ wait on a friday night around 7pm. understandable, but crappy. when i finally made a reservation to return, it was painful to talk to anyone over the phone (their reception is terrible) and i had to settle for an earlier dinner time. i was happy once i arrived at the restaurant that we were seated at the bar since we got to interact with the bartenders and check out what else was happening in this place. what we ordered: -salmon sashimi don with salmon roe with miso soup the salmon roe was excellent. the salmon sashimi was just average, even a little dry. i was happy with this dish because of the quality of the salmon roe. it was tasty. -beef short rib this was good but the short rib was cut into tiny chunks so after you stuck a chopstick in the dish once, it was reduced to hundreds of strands swimming in gravy. could have been better. -cold, fresh tofu with ginger tofu was excellent. -onigiri with pickled plum this was good. be prepared for a helluva sour pickled plum! they also include pickled cucumber on the side of this dish that is pickled with oba leaf. if oba leaf is not your favorite thing in the world (it is not my favorite thing in the world), then you will likely not enjoy these. -tuna sashimi with 'grated' mountain yam this dish caused the most unexpected reaction. you would assume from the name that 'grated' implies something that is like, shaved/thin and resting on top of the fish. not at all. the mountain yam or whatever it is is basically turned into a slimy paste and the fish is buried underneath it. i would not have ordered this dish if i had known it was going to be served this way. the tuna was high quality, but i would definitely pass on this, unless you're into slime piles. -dessert: pear millefeuille average. i should have gone with the creme brulee everyone else was yelping about. pass. pros: -it really doesn't feel like you're deep underground in the stank basement of a a nondescript ?70s office building, once you're in the restaurant (is this actually a pro? i'm not sure) -bartenders have excellent knowledge of all of the sakes served here and are very helpful if you are new to sakes - they will let you sample lots of yummy stuff and make some recommendations. we ordered a sake called KEN and it was excellent. -as other yelpers mentioned, cool japanese toilets :) -good atmosphere - the restaurant is not overly crowded, the noise level is pleasant and they play some good jazz in the background cons: -this place is expensive for what it is. seriously. even though the sake was good, most of the glasses started at $11 and the stuff that was actually good (like the "Ken" was $25 a glass). -portions are really small -while the bartenders are knowledgeable and wonderful in terms of helping you choose sake, there is a SERIOUS disconnect at this restaurant in terms of bar service. we were served dish after dish with new bowls and utensils placed in front of us, without the last setting cleared. by the time we were finished eating, there were about 10-12 random empty dishes sitting in front of us. this was really strange and cluttered, especially since we were sitting at the bar. -dessert was just average. earl grey ice cream on the dessert had a strange aftertaste oh, did i mention that i was still hungry when i left this place? BAD SIGN!!!!! Tip for anyone willing to head into Brooklyn for excellent japanese food: try Hibino in Cobble Hill!!!!! Hibino's homemade tofu is amazing and made fresh daily. The beef short rib is my favorite and will not disintegrate before your eyes (and before it enters your mouth). It's worth the trip!!!!

Good gosh, I loved this place. Well, not the look from the street. There is just one teeny sandwich board sign out front of a generic office building. You go down the stairs to the windowless basement, but there you find a pleasant space. A long bar with tempting sake bottles. Small tables along a wall. No windows, but the food will fulfill all of your senses. The food was incredibly delicious, very reminiscent of Japan and arrived quickly at my table. Not a single complaint. I got the combo of eel donburi and soba. Yum yum yum! I so wish this place were in my backyard so I could go again and again. I do wish the staff were quicker about refiling the tea cups, but all in all they were fine. The food is incredible and should be enough to entice you to visit. Doo it!

Sakagura: Underground, magical entrance to Japan hidden near Grand Central? It might as well be. I don't even remember how we came about this traditional Japanese restaurant very late on Saturday night... but it was highly amusing to me to discover that Sakagura is in the basement of my old language class building in Midtown. Of all the buildings in the area, I was not expecting a secret subterranean restaurant in this one filled with bamboo decor, dim lighting and Japanese people furiously cooking away. What a surprise! I came here for a continuation of sake drinking and eating with two friends. I made no decisions whatsover regarding the choice of fare which was fine with me; I left everything up to them as I didn't care either way. Everything we ate and drank was excellent, so good job boys. I remember there was a large bottle of cold sake immersed in ice bucket filled with fresh flowers. I remember there was black and red roe covering a dish of who knows what that I could not have enough of. I remember there was scrumptiously salty uni which I had never eaten in such large quantities before. I remember there was hot and juicy beef tongue stewed in a bowl of miso that just melted in your mouth on impact. Other than that, you got me; that's all I needed to remember. I am making a mental note for myself to come back here during more normal hours to take another look at their menu. If you do choose to find the entrance and descend the stairs, prepare to be transported and have no cell phone service.

We finally got a chance to have lunch in Sakagura last Monday (11/5), and now I can see why it is such a popular place on Yelp! This place was a bit hard to find in the first place, but the good food and good service made up for the slight inconvenience. We made a reservation for 12 pm, and we were seated at a table with a good view of the dining room. Their lunch menu was very extensive, and a bit disorienting for a first-timer like me. I settled with the daily lunch soba set ($11.50): hot soba with tuna and avocado over rice. The food was delicious, and the portion was quite generous. Immediately, I forgot about Ise, Haru, and other places that I usually went for Japanese lunch specials. I wish I could come here more often! I also have to note that their rice was cooked nicely -- it was so appetizing that I finished the whole big bowl. My husband ordered the Jewel Oke Bento ($20). which was an assortment sashimi, rice balls, and other appetizers. It was a beautiful set, and delicious as well. The restaurant was filled up pretty soon. It was bright, vibrant, and warm. Everyone looked very happy and satisfied.

Maybe it was the Old Fashions, Beer and Sake much earlier in the night, but this place was top notch. The location is just strange but when you walk down the stairs and enter...you know you are going to experience something amazing. The two things that stood out for me was the ONSEN TAMAGO : ?Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup And the most spectacular dish of the night, the GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : ?Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato, Spinach, and Shiitake Mushrooms. I will be coming back soon to this place hopefully very soon. Thanks again to my dining partners which made the night grand.

I went here for lunch today for a "bounenkai" with my co-workers and ordered the $30 tasting set. Wow! First a plate of sashimi, then cold soba followed by tempura, fish, and steak. Finished the meal with the goma creme brulee. The food was very good and for that price we all were surprised. It looked light, but we were full.

It has become my new favorite Japanese restaurant in New York! The food was amazing! We had Onsen Tamago, which was a cold soup with soft boiled egg, sea urchin and salmon roe, ?super yummy! Buta Kakumi is stewed diced pork belly, tasted very rich in flavor and texture. Gyu Miso Nikomi was my favorite! It was a stew beef ribs with grated radish. It was sweet, salty, and the flavor existed in my mouth for literally Two days! I also tried the spicy plum wine sorbet and jello shot, it was quite special too! We'll definitely go back again. Actually, we'd love to go again today!

This is my favourite bar in New York. Not only because they serve sho-chu, but because the food is incredible! I adore izakaya style food, and Sakagura, hidden in the basement of a high rise, does some of the best. The atmosphere of the place is immersive, with lots of wood and bamboo, with a modern touch. It's a beautiful place to relax and sample the dishes. The dishes are small, so you can order a few and not feel too full. None were very expensive, although after a few drinks, it does start to add up. My favorite was hands down the Uzaku - a delicate salad made with lovingly prepared pieces of high quality eel. So good! There was also a tuna and mountain yam dish, made with such high quality tuna that it felt as if it were melting in your mouth. Everything we tried at Sakagura was memorable and top-notch, not one bad dish! We were seated at the bar, and the bar tenders were all immensely helpful, even making my favorite shochu cocktail, although it wasn't on the menu. I know it sounds weird, but make sure you visit the restroom - the toilet has heated seats and more buttons than my TV remote. An incredible find, you won't be disappointed!

Absolutely delicious Japanese food! Now I see why all the great reviews! My friend and I were able to get a reservation here for lunch and we ordered the special of the day, Uni soba and the Sashimi Don. The Uni soba was served cold and though I am usually not a fan of cold soups, this was perfection. The broth was rich and full of briny ocean flavor. The uni was not overpowering, it was just the right amount for the soup and went nicely with the soba noodles. This was truly a wonderful dish. The sashimi don was my absolute favorite though! I never usually order sashimi don, which I thought was just raw fish pieces over rice. I could not be more wrong. Each piece of sashimi had so much flavor that I almost believe that it was seasoned and marinated. The sushi rice was perfect and also flavorful with bits of seaweed strewn about. It was actually the Salmon Roe that brought this entire dish together and the flavor was super fresh and infused every bite with even more fresh seafood flavor. This dish goes down as one of my favorite Japanese dishes ever and I highly recommend it if you are here. I will definitely be back for dinner to try more dishes on their menu. I will also be back for some of that perfect sashimi don at lunch as well! Highly recommended!

I was introduced to Sakagura many years ago by a friend who discovered the place completely by accident. Since then, I've been coming here at least once a year. Sakagura is one of ?the pioneers that led the explosion of izakaya places in NY. The owners also own Sake Bar Decibel in EV and saying they know a thing or two about sake would be an understatement. Once you have made your way down to the basement and entered the restaurant, you will find yourself looking at the longest sake bar in NY*. ?Large bottles of sake line up along the wall behind the bar and that alone should give you a hint that this place means business. The sake choices are extensive and they keep changing. They usually start around $55/60, so they are not cheap but worth the money if you are a sake lover. Last year they had some sake from the Fukushima prefecture that ?wouldn't be available anymore due to the nuclear disaster and were raising funds for the victims. As far as the food goes, ?the menu seems different every time I am here but thankfully there are some constants. I would recommend: Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly) - Warning: this is a very heavy dish but damn it's good! Gyutan Yawaraka Ni (stewed beef tongue) - They have changed the dish over the years but the essence of it remains the same. The tongue is always perfectly cooked. Hirame Ponzu - Fluke Sashimi served with an awesome citrusy ponzu sauce Onigiri w Spicy Cod Roe (rice balls) - Cuz you always need a rice dish and who doesn't like spicy cod roe? Onsen Tamago (soft boiled egg) - I tried this for the first time last week when I came here with two friends and it was amazing. It was topped with uni and salmon roe. Highly recommended for izakaya! * I'm guessing here but I haven't seen a bar as long as Sakagura's in any of the izakaya places in NY.

Get to the Chase: Pros: 1) Fantastic individual morsels of food, that melt in your mouth, explode with deliciousness, or hit the spot you been craving for all week 2) Authentic Japanese cuisine and does the food justice 3) Quaint, classy, and fun ambience 4) Very courteous staff, and always attentive to your needs 5) AWESOME BATHROOM! LIKE FOSHO...it's kind of like hidden in this bamboo-esque wall, and inside is dim-lit like a romantic movie scene (so you're totally in the zone to calmly let yourself go and clean yourself up), and the toilet is like one of those japanese electric ones!!!!! hello bidet? (could'nt find that part) Cons: 1) Took off one star, because I left hungry and because my wallet was empty....I got hoodwinked yo! Usually if you go with a bloody group of 12 the costs should go down and the food should be plenty....but it's the opposite. We had 6 bottles of sake though...that might've done it too...but still I literally had 1 sushi and that's it....and spent $125+tip O_O

This place was great. The food was amazing, although a part of me thinks that I suffered from just a tad too much hype prior to coming here. In terms of the food, we ordered the onsen tamago, the smoked duck, the buta kakuni, and the gyutan all of which were great. My favorite was the Gyutan which literally fell apart at the tips of my chopsticks. The dessert of black sesame creme brulee was also delicious. The flavor so subtle, perfect with the ice cream. The service was so attentive and just perfect. We sat at the bar. The bartender made very helpful suggestions as to which sakes to order. The plum wine was a little too sweet but he had warned us of that. The restrooms all have bidets which, without going into too much detail, were interesting to use. Will definitely be coming back here again and bringing all my out of town friends. A true NY gem.

Sometimes it can be hard to get a reservation, and if you do, there can still be a wait. It doesn't matter what you order because everything on the menu is good. Which is a good thing, I suppose, since everything is tapa size- you can order a bunch of things. The desserts are also amazing, and I always find myself ordering more than one dessert. Place is a bit hard to find if you are a first timer. It's located inside a corporate building. As a matter of fact, it's in the basement.

Amazing! Ordered a variety of dishes - tuna sashimi, chilled tofu, salmon don, doughnuts, poached egg, dumplings, grilled cod, etc. Favorites were the chilled tofu, salmon don and doughnuts! Was less of a fan of the cooked dumplings and cod. Definitely preferred the raw foods! Overall, this place is a great Japanese restaurant in Midtown -- fresh food, great service, varied menu, and reasonably priced!

My friend and I came here for a celebratory dinner and we decided to try some exotic foods from the menu. This was my first experience at an upscale Japanese restaurant. ?Sakagura's food presentation and taste, and customer service certainly did not disappoint, rather they surpassed my expectations of a Japanese restaurant. ? The art of simplicity in the presentation of some of their dishes is quite astounding and the art of complexity in the presentation of their other dishes is just as fascinating. It was such a completely diff. exp.compared to the other Japanese restaurants I went to. We had 10 items: 1)One of the featured rare sakes from Japan: it was cold, not too strong, smooth, and refreshing. 2) HIYAYAKKO: Very simple - a block of tofu w/ a beautiful bonito flake garnish on top. The tofu consistency was neither too soft so it would fall apart when you put a spoon thru it, nor too firm so that it would be chunky. ?It was just right & your teeth can slice right thru the tofu. Finish the tofu w/ soysauce & you'll have a delicious & simple appetizer. 3) ONSEN TAMAGO:I had a bad experience w/ sea urchins before so I was afraid to try this in the beginning, but I felt pretty adventurous to give it another shot. The exotic ingredients, ?interesting concept, & simple presentation made this dish a delight. The sea urchin had a light texture, was salty, & fresh. ?As a salt lover, this dish hit the spot for me. The spoon had an incredibly shallow scoop so it can get messy w/ scooping anything in there. ?Patrons would have even a better exp. if the spoon had a deeper scoop so they can taste all 4 components together, rather than separately. ?The roe was one of my favorite- ?those tiny amber colored balls burst into a splash of salty water the second you bite into it or squeeze it between your tongue & the roof of your mouth. ? 4)JAGA DANGO: Not sure if this was meant to be a hot/warm/cool appetizer. ?Surely, doughnuts are meant to be eaten in its room temperature but mashed potatoes are meant to be eaten hot. ?The 4 jaga dangos were served on top of 2 white pieces of paper on a black plate, with a small side dish of salt, but not enough salt. I would suggest putting the tiny dish of salt in the middle of the 4 jaga dangos&MORE salt so it would be easier to get the salt. Interesting concept, but there were more batter than mashed potatoes. ?I liked the simplicity of it & the change in taste as soon as you add salt to it. Try it w/ & w/o the salt, it tastes like you're eating 2 diff. things! 5) BUTA KAKUNI: Another salty dish that my taste-buds liked!T his dish came w/ a REAL spoon! ?The pork had a great texture, delicious, tender, & even though it was in broth, the pork itself was juicy & not bland nor overcooked. I suggest to use less broth so the pork belly can stand out in the bowl more. 6) GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI: The presentation was wonderful, simple, & elegant. Hands down, one of the most fun dishes and experiences with food I've ever had! you get to cook the meat yourself! Once the waiter demonstrated how to work this dish before leaving us to it by ourselves, you'll be hoping more restaurants did stuff like this. ?Aside from the presentation and mini cooking exp, the beef tongue was lean, had a great texture when you bite into it, & very soft. If you squeeze some lemon juice while its cooking, the meat will become juicier and much more tender. LOVED It! 7) HOMEMADE " NIHACHI SOBA": The soba was served on a square plate & on a mini sushi wooden mat w/ shredded seaweed as the garnish, w/ individual dipping sauces, wasabi, & scallion. ?Great presentation itself. The soba was cooked perfectly so you won't have the exp. of it constantly breaking when you pick it up with your chopsticks if its overcooked, neither would have to chew through it if its undercooked. ?I suggest to give more wasabi. Some patons might like it more spicy. 8)HIRAME PONZU: Beautiful & careful presentation, & each sashimi slices were equal in size & had the right thickness so its not like putting a slab of goo in your mouth. Adding the diced scallion & roe on the sashimi gave it a good crunch when you eat it. 9)CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE: First time having a souffle & I was quite amazed. The chemistry of sweet hot melted dark chocolate mixed w/ the lightness of egg whites easily made me enjoy this dessert. ?It had a great balance in that the dark chocolate did not overwhelm so it would be bitter. Delicious! 10)BLACK SESAME CREME BRULEE: first time ever having creme brulee & i enjoyed every spoonful of it but eating the sugar torched top was the equivalent of someone asking for other people's pizza crust. You just want more of that ONE thing from it bc its what makes that dish so special, flavorful, & fun. The black sesame ice cream & thing on top of the creme brulee also gives a very aromatic aftertaste that kicks your senses. Great quality food & dining experience. Highly recommended!

Came here for lunch awhile ago and the food was just as delicious as the first time around. I had the Kaisen Don/Soba set - a warm bowl of fresh rice topped with all sorts of seafood goodies complemented by cold soba and oshinko (pickles). For one, the quality of the sashimi was excellent. The ikura (salmon roe) was especially fresh. I normally don't like to eat ikura because it has such a strong salty and unpleasantly fishy taste. However, the ikura on my Kaisen Don was so light and luscious - mixed with rice, they tasted like pure, unadulterated ocean. Honestly, I've only had fresher fish in Tokyo. I was also shocked by the size of the portions. Based on my previous dinner experience, I thought the lunch portions would be petite but instead, they were huge. Everything was served extra-large, which, if you're hungry, is a very good thing. ? Like the time before, this experience was excellent. Sakagura, in my book, you can do no wrong! Yuhe's Suggestions: - If you are starving and on a budget, get the Oyako Don! At $11.50, this gigantic bowl (as big as your head) of tender chicken, buttery eggs, crisp sweet onions and rice is a perfectly hearty meal. -Lunch doesn't seem to be as crowded as dinner. So, if you're dying to try Sakagura but haven't been able to get a good dinner reservation, come for lunch! They also have specials that you can only get during lunch time!

Had a great lunch time tasting menu here on my visit to NY to see my boo. Walked in around 1:30 and had a 5 minute wait. They are staring a new early-lunch club, where you get perks for eating before noon...not a bad way to save some cash $$! The food was very good, but not mind-blowingly memorable. Our $30 tasting menu included 4 courses, which i thought was a decent deal for NY! We left very full! Course 1: Sashimi platter was very good. Fresh pieces, good quality cuts of fish. Decent offering. Course 2: Udon with seaweed on top. Great mix of flavors, couldn't stop eating it. Course 3: 3 tiers, including tempura veggies and shrimp, seared butterfish with lotus root, and teriyaki steak in a sweet sauce. The steak was delicious. Definitely the best thing I had the entire lunch. Tempura was crisp and perfectly fried, without being soggy. Butterfish was strong flavored outside, but very good. Course 4: Dessert. We opted for the chocolate souffle with the raspberry sauce and ice cream. Delish but suuuuper decadent!

Great underground place. I like how the menu offers selections not usually seen in japanese restaurants. The hostess always says you have 1 1/2 hours at your table for your reservation but I've definitely stayed longer and never been harassed to get up and leave. Staff is very attentive and yet unobtrusive.

A real gem. I didn't know what to expect as I enter what appeared to be an office building and went down some steps. I walked in and was struck by the inviting and cozy restaurant. The list of sake was outstanding, as was the waiter who recommended different ones to try. For food we had the following which was excellent Hirame Ponzu (this was so refreshing, I could of had 3 dishes of it) Ebi Sticks Maguro Natto (my husband liked, it wasn't my type of dish, I realize fermented soy beans aren't my thing) Gyu Miso Nikomi (completely melts in your mouth) If you like authentic Japanese dishes and an impressive sake list, you won't be disappointed!

Fantastic place! It's in the basement of a place that looks like an office building, so don't get scared off. ?Went there in a group of 8, and they had a table reserved as promised. ?We ordered a lot of small plates, and everything was inventive and delicious. ?Staff was super friendly and helpful in recommendations. ?The fluke was my favorite. ?Fresh ingredients, nice atmosphere, and the bill didn't break the bank. ?With tax and tip, it was $40 each for the 2 people who didn't drink beer/sake and $60 per person for the other. ?Not bad for a fun night out.

The last thing you want to do on vacation is to hear suits next to you talk about "expanding business" and "increasing revenue." But the food is worth the nuance that comes with lunching around this area. I got the daily special of a bowl of soba noodles bathed in uni soup with uni on top. I was completely uni-ed out by the end, but in a good way. ? Everything looked good on the menu but I was really happy to have chosen this.

If there's one city in the world where a large space in the basement of what looks like a nondescript office building is too crowded to seat you, on what feels like the coldest day of the year (and really everyone should be in their pajamas under the covers), it's New York. In any case though, I thought I could waltz in without a reservation at Sakagura. A restaurant with 533 reviews. How naive. We did have a little bit of a wait to be seated, but ours was a small party of 2 and it wasn't too bad. My husband and I had already munched on an early dinner (partly due to the lack of vegetarian options here) and so ended up doing what we usually do at great restaurants with limited vegetarian options. Drinks + Dessert. My favourite parts of any meal anyway! We shared a couple of different kinds of sake between the two of us, and I found that our server's recommendation was on point. They do have an extensive list of sake so colour me suitably impressed at him knowing that like the back of his hand. The food at Sakagura, in all its limited vegetarian friendliness, is actually quite tasty. Undeterred by minor facts like we'd already eaten dinner, we went ahead and ordered a few appetizers to share anyway. Let's call it.. for the sake of research, hmm? The eggplant with three different kinds of miso(red, spinach and egg yolk) was delicate, understated and grilled perfectly. We also shared the seaweed salad with the citrus vinaigrette. The black sesame creme brulee was certainly interesting, and I might order it another day when I'm in the mood for something different, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the texture itself. Owing to the addition of sesame, the custard had taken a grainy form, though I loved the texture of the delicate caramel, which shattered upon the slightest little tap of my spoon. We also got the chocolate souffle, which was predictably tasty. We also got to live through the first date of the couple that was seated by us. Thanks for being so loud, it was quite the entertainment. We have a bet on how long it will last for you two but sadly we may never find out.

Sakagura has never disappointed me. They have small dishes so you can try a lot of things. Their specials are also always really good. My crab rice claypot was the best! My favorites are their sea urchin, duck, salmon don, and black sesame creme brulee!

Shady basements in New York City usually lead to: 1. A weird basement store that probably sells more than clothes, if you know what I mean. 2. Exactly where your imagination goes to when you read "shady basements." 3. Really, really, really good food. This basement actually wasn't shady at all, but, if I have to go downstairs from ground level for my food, my Metal Gear Solid codec alert goes off. But seriously, I am glad that I usually don't take my own advice, because this place was amazing. I came here twice, once with a friend with a friend without a reservation (! don't do this, we waited for over half an hour) and once with my cousin. The food is consistently wonderful, gorgeously plated, and perfectly proportioned. I mean, don't you just hate it when they give you too much rice and not enough of whatever was supposed to be supplying the flavor? Well, that won't ever happen here. The compartments of their rice bowls (especially the sake don) are perfectly measured, every time, from the rice to the sashimi to the roe. It's like happiness in a bowl.

I've been here maybe 4-5 times, and have always assumed I had already given it a spectacular review. Usually, the more you've been to a restaurant, the less you glorify it, but Sakagura has always upheld a certain standard. Every time I walk in, either all the tables are occupied, or the tables are reserved (I'd say 75% of them are marked, even if you do a walk-in on a weekday at the opening time of 11:30am). As a restaurant, hidden it is, but a secret it is no more. The surprising thing about it is, the prices are unreasonably reasonable. Our favorite items to order: Hirame Ponzu ($9): fluke sashimi with chives and diakon in a citrus vinaigrette; so refreshing! Buta Kakuni ($5): braised pork belly, juicy and tender, enough to share between 2 people. I've never seen it this cheap. Maguro Tartar ($16): tuna steeped in yuzu, very good. Bara Chirashi Don ($11.50 on the daily soba set lunch special menu, limited to availability): what an insane deal for this filling set! Other great dishes: Tori Karaage ($8): fried chicken, best when dipped in that daikon/ponzu mix from other dishes! We actually liked the fried pork more due to the meat being more tender. Tori Tsukune ($6): these chicken meatballs in teriyaki sauce weren't amazing, but it's been a tradition of ours to order. Gindara Yuan Yaki ($10): grilled cod in sweet soy sauce, but has a savory kick to balance out. A great selection of sake too; if that's your main focus, you need to sit at the bar. They offer tasting specials too. Fancy glassware and presentation to keep stuffs cold.

3 stars for having the best sake selections in town, 3 stars for the very polite and Japanese staff. 3 stars for the charming location. 0 stars for the food. The dishes were boring and tasteless. Lack of creativity and enthusiasm. The presentation was redundant. For the same amount you spend here or less, you are better off at Zutto Japanese American Pub. The price of sake and beer are way more reasonable.

The sake oyako don (salmon sashimi and roe over rice) is really great here and very artistically presented. I love how the salmon roe would burst in my mouth with flavor. I also enjoyed the agedashi tofu. We had some crab dish over rice, which I think might have been a special. It was delicious! What really stood out here were the desserts. The chocolate souffle was outstanding and perfectly moist. My sister really loved the black sesame creme brulee. Even if you're full, definitely order the desserts here!

As far as GOOD JAPANESE IZAKAYA FOOD goes, I Think Sakagura is as good as it gets here in NYC. Woodsy, comfy atmosphere, kind staff, and great food. It is in the basement, so kind of a hidden jem of the city. As a Japanese living in NYC, I would say I go here at least once a month. It does get a little pricy, but it's like any tapas, so if you eat about 3 small plates, it will end up being about $20-25. In aJapanese Izakaya, the whole idea is for you to share your food and DRINK. so the food is designed to be some what shareable, and to go really well with alcohol :) I am personally NOT a big drinker, but I find the food excellent anyway. you go with three other friends, and you will be able to try about 12 platestogether! Authentic, good quality Japanese bar food. my personal favorites are: Onigiri (with tarako and ikura), fluke with ponzu, daikon salad, tofu salad, karaage (fried chicken), onnsen tamago, and beef tongue. a must for a Japanese food fan!

Sizzling hot outside today, so what could be better than a bowl of ice cold, handmade soba and a buckwheat beer in a subterranean retreat? Nothing, except for the pristine sashimi dabbed with fresh grated wasabi. Sakagura is known for its extensive sake collection and limited edition fresh soba, but all the food is appealing, and I love the cavernous room, which is decorated like a Kurosawa feudal Japan movie set. Go anytime, but the ample lunch specials (which all comes with a side of soba) are a great value at $11.50. The frequent diner point system has a sadistic twist because you don't get a stamp unless you spend $12, but a beer or dessert will put you over the limit.

I came here for lunch with a group of 6 and it was an awesome place for lunch!! ?Super authentic, lots of Japanese people eating there, and all the decor and menu options seemed like the real deal. I got their duck curry udon (Kamo Curry Numban), and the duck was REALLY GOOD!!! ?Super moist and flavorful with the right amount of fat. ?I also ordered the sesame spinach salad (Gomaae), which was SO good- I would order 5 of these and eat them all at once, it's cold boiled spinach tossed in this light sesame dressing- delicious!! My colleagues got their vegetable udon which they didn't like as much as mine. ?It's spacious and they had quick service. ?Great place to check out if you're in the area!

Sakagura--located in the basement of a Midtown East office building with no cell phone reception--is one of the top sake bars in the United States. Founded in 1996, the restaurant has the nickname "hidden jewel" and, according to the website, the customers say that walking into Sakagura is "like walking into Tokyo." We ordered a bunch of appetizers to start off the meal. The first dish that came to the table was Hirame Ponzu ($9), or Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish and Salmon Roe Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette. The filet of fluke was melt-in-your-mouth fresh. The citrus vinaigrette gave a little tang to the tongue, while the salmon roe added salty flavor. Next dish was Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku ($12), or Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso (Eggyolk, Spinach, and Sweet Red). Eggplants is a vegetable that I love almost as much as squash. Again, I could probably eat three plates of this dish alone all to myself. The eggplants were cooked in three different kinds of miso that were a bit sweet, but it wasn't the artificial "Splenda" sweetness, but tasted very natural.The eggplants were so mushy and sweet. I loved the slightly burnt part at the end with the sweet glaze. The black sesame seeds were a nice touch. Honestly, I couldn't really taste the difference between this and the egg yolk eggplant. The third kind--Sweet Red--was the only one with very distinct, melted chocolate-like texture and flavor on top of the eggplant. Jidori Shioyaki ($14), or Grilled Organic Free Range Chicken Served with Sea Salt and "Yuzu" Citrus Pepper. We squeezed lemon on top of the chicken for extra tanginess. The chicken was grilled to perfection: slightly burnt on top and juicy inside. The waitress then brought Kamo Roast ($10), Slices of Chilled Roasted Duck Wrapped Around Scallion Accented with Basil Sauce.The thinly sliced duck tasted very similar to roast beef. I wished the scallions hadn't been cut so thinly because I wanted a bit more of the crunchiness from the vegetable. Next was the physically heaviest dish: Beef on Hot Stone Pot ($??). The plate underneath was made with stone, as well as the hot stone pot, so the waiter seemed to be struggling as he brought the dish to the table. After rubbing a piece of lard on the hot stone, we put strips of tender beef on top.This is a dish you have to eat quickly before the stone pot cools down. For me, it wasn't a huge problem because I like my meat rare. Give me some blood! The beef, which had no additional seasoning, was so tender and juicy. The best way to eat (good) beef is just plain and cooked on a grill. As though we weren't already full with all the appetizers, we each ordered a main course. I had Sake Oyako Don ($16), Fillets of Fresh Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe Steeped in Soy Sauce Served Atop a bowl of Rice and Served with Miso Soup. Because the restaurant was dark, I didn't notice the silvery skin on the salmon while I was eating it. If I had known, I probably would have freaked out and peeled that part off.The salmon roe on top was really salty, which balanced off the sushi rice underneath. The salmon was so soft and creamy (?), and perhaps a bit fatty.I am a huge fan of seaweed and rice, so I liked that there were flakes of seaweed on top of the rice. The Sea Salt Chocolate Homemade Sorbet ($6) wasn't too sweet or creamy like a regular ice cream with still the same amount of indulgence. It always amazes me how sweet and salty go together so well. The Chocolate Souffle with Vanilla Ice Cream and Raspberry Sauce ($9). My favorite moment when eating a souffle is breaking it with the spoon. The souffle had powdered sugar on top. It looked like there was matcha powder on the side. The souffle was quite decadent and had strong chocolate flavor. The raspberry sauce went well with the chocolate, and the vanilla ice cream gave cool flavors to the otherwise warm souffle.

Delicious food, abundant sake and an exasperatingly hidden location in an office building that makes you gasp when you descend into a sexy cavernous space. I have tried several izakayas in the city and this one is by far the best in terms of menu variety, unusual offerings and quality of food. There were no bad dishes, just good and better ones. Some of the highlights ONSEN TAMAGO - soft boiled egg with sea urchin and salmon roe - if the ingredients ?alone are not enough to make you salivate then maybe it's not for you. For fans of sea urchin, it's a briny symphony DAIKON SALAD - surprisingly simple and delicious GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI - Beef tongue in miso- I am not a fan of beef tongue but this was nothing like any beef tongue I had- a velvet texture of a filet mignon with much more gaminess and flavor

Great izakaya place, at an affordable price. ?It is a little hard to find, since it's located at the basement of an office building. ?Once you walk in, you'd be surprised to find a large and nicely decorated Japanese restaurant. You don't get cell reception when you are in the restaurant, so def make a list of what you want to eat from the yelp reviews before you get to the restaurant! ?We went right when it opened at 6 pm, so we were able to get seated at the bar right away. This is what we ordered: IKA SHIOKARA : ?Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade BUTA KAKUNI : ?Stewed Diced Pork ? TORI TSUKUNE : ?Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce GYU MISO NIKOMI : ?Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish GINDARA YUAN YAKI : ?Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce Also had the fried chicken, and the black sesame creme brulee and the pear millefeuille with earl gray ice cream. ? All of the dishes were solid, but my favorite was the gyu miso nikomi. ?The meat was perfectly cooked and it was a good balance between sweet and savory. ?I ?used my spoon and ate every bite of that sauce. ?The raw squid was definitely interesting and unique. ?It has a very buttery taste, and while it's good, I'm glad it comes in a tiny portion. ?The buta kakuni is such a guilty pleasure. ?It has a thick layer of fat which is what makes it taste so good. ?Just don't think about it and eat it. ?It comes in a single portion, but I ended up sharing it with a friend, and we both thought it was the perfect portion size because it is very rich and fatty. ? And for the dessert. ?the black sesame creme brulee is great, and a must try. ? ? ? ? ? I was surprised that there were a lot of empty tables at the restaurant, but had a long line of people waiting to be seated, probably those without reservations.

I lived in New York for 4 years and never knew about this place until I moved to Seattle and saw pictures of a friend's friend. The picture that drew me in was of the onsen tamago, uni and ikura in cold dashi. With something as inventive as that (I've been to many Japanese restaurants, worked in 2 and lived in Tokyo for 2 years), I knew I had to try it during my trip visiting NY. A few of my friends who have lived in NY for more than 4 years were all excited to try it since none of them have been there either. It's a little hard to find since it's in the basement of an office building. I was getting giddy as we entered the restaurant. Felt like we were discovering this secret hidden gem. We ordered A LOT of food between the 4 of us and everything was delicious, even the simple dishes, they made to perfection and had a slight twist to it. The seaweed salad was 4 kinds of seaweed. The nasu age came with different types of pastes different from the usual miso. The uni dish that made me want to come in the first place did not disappoint! We each ordered our own! I usually don't like Uni and maybe because I haven't had good uni. It melted like butter in my mouth and did not taste fishy at all. We didn't realize how big the pork belly was. We ordered one for each person and it was definitely way more than we needed. Probably 1 order is more than enough for 2 people. We had this pulled pork dish that was really tasty as well. BTW, if you go to the bathroom, make sure you look above for the doll to figure out if it's the men or women's bathroom! I went into the wrong one without looking!

Located on the B1 floor, this place was a little hard to find at first, but as soon as I stepped inside the restaurant I really felt like I had been transported to an izakaya in Japan; despite being in the basement, they did a great job decorating, and the ambiance was really nice. I went for lunch and got the lunch set, which included soba and a half-size tendon, as well as a pickled side dish and mugi tea. The food was delicious and tasted like proper Japanese cuisine, much better than some of the failed attempts by some of the other 'Japanese' restaurants I've visited in the past. The prices for the lunch menu were reasonable, considering I got a lot of good food. The service was very courteous and patiently answered questions, despite clearly being busy during the lunch-time rush. I'm not a big sake fan, so I didn't try any of the sake. I don't think I would eat dinner here or come here to drink, based on the evening prices. If you're a fan of Japanese alcohol, it might be worth it, though, as it looks like they have a huge selection. I would recommend making a reservation (for either lunch or dinner), because it is very crowded during mealtime rush hours. I didn't make a reservation for lunch, so my party had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but the bar had seats available the entire time I was there.

This place is darn pricey, but man was it good. We had some of their appetizers, like carpaccios and salads, also tsukune. We had their seafood donburi at the end with ikura and salmon. Their ikura was DELICIOUS! Sooo good! I think it was coated in some special soy-sauce like sauce to add flavor, but whatever it was, it was great! I can't go to these places without parents who pay for the meal... but man this place rocked. The atmosphere is also very cool. Saka-gura means "in the cave/den of sakes" and they live up to the name. Huge barrel-like objects are in the den-like restaurant to recreate what a traditional, sake-brewing den looks like in Japan. Overall a good experience here!

I came here for dinner 3 more times and it's amazing how much I love this place now. I think my last review was just based on a lunch experience I had here but now it's become one of my favorite japanese places. Pork belly was divine. Tuna tartar was really good. Even the tofu salad was pretty awesome. Cod was okay but the uni soba was by far my favorite. One thing to mention was the service was a little questionable. We were confused about the sake bottle sizes and she wasn't really good at explaining anything. Then she brought us this tiny little half bottle but we were expecting a large bottle and it turned out to be 90 dollars on the check. Each person barely got a shot out of it. I guess that would be my only complaint.

I came to New York on vacation, and my friend brought me to this restaurant. I cannot thank him enough for bringing me. The sake oyako don ($16) is AMAZING. The salmon sashimi is the best I've ever tasted, and the restaurant is located underground in the middle of New York City, which makes the dining experience even more awesome. The salmon roe is a lot larger than the one you normally find in sushi so it packs a little surprise every time you bite into it. The presentation is quite nice also. The portions are definitely a lot smaller, but I would recommend this place to people who enjoy high quality food and are willing to pay for it.

Came here with some friends after hearing about the "hidden" nature of the venue. tried calling to get reservations but no one picked up =(. i tried amex concierge and got a table for 8:30. thank you amex!! had a bottle of junmai ginjo sake that the waiter recommended (light and floral) it was good. they have a massive selection. I can't say the food was memorable - everything was good but not great. small izakaya type plates. I would come back purely for the sake and ambiance. oh yea it was pricey.

This place is great! ?My cousin brought my parents and me here when we were visiting, and we were curious as to where she was meeting us. ?When you look for this restaurant, you find yourself walking into this apartment/office building thing, then into the basement. ?Strange location, but it's kind of nice in that hidden gem kind of way. The food was amazing, and the sake collection was even better. ?Each different type of sake you get comes out in a different bottle with different sake glasses, and it was so much fun just to see what type of beautiful glassware they would bring out next. ? we got the: Gindara Yuan Yaki ($10) - very yummy if you like cod! Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku ($12) - all of the different misos were great...pretty small portions for what you're paying (especially just for eggplants) Homemade Nihachi Soba ($12) - with fresh wasabi :) Sanma Onigiri ($10) - how does anybody not like onigiri? Tori karaage ($8) - pretty much the same as other japanese restaurants' Karaage Hirame Ponzu ($9) Saikoro Steak ($12) - very yummy and if you feel like eating something more substantial this feels very filling. I forget which sake we got, but I think our waitress was spot-on with the recommendations and you can't go wrong with any of them. ? Our desserts: Black Sesame Creme Brulee ($9) - very interesting and delicious. creamy with a nice touch of sesame Sake Manju ($6) - I couldn't really tell any difference from the "Sake Lees Bun stuffed with Red beans" to any other red bean bao that you get at dim sum, but it was delicious nonetheless.

Had to downgrade Sakagura. ? Went a couple weeks ago for lunch again, and they rushed my dining companion and I like crazy even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. ?Granted, the food was great (we both got the bento, and split the green tea ice cream for dessert, I had sake my companion had beer) the service could have been better. ?I understand they were probably in a hurry to have their break and get ready for their dinner service, however, with two people just sitting and chatting (like the other two tables) was it that necessary to rush us? ?I'll be hesitant to go back to Sakagura for a leisurely/relaxed/unrushed lunch. ? I totally dug their rice balls/rolls that came with the bento box.

Food was OK, a bit too oily for me: - Eggplant w/miso (deepfried) - Grilled cod in sweet soy (also very oily) - Tuna Tartar w/caviar (wasn't very fresh, lots of tendons + fishy) - ?Chawanmushi ** THIS was good, small victories** Overwhelming sake selection. Cool, tucked away little japanese place -- seems like you probably should make a reservation. Quiet but loud enough for both a date spot or just a few friends. Very authentic. Overall would come back, probably more for snacks + sake than dinner though

This place was great! We passed it and had to go back looking for the entrance, but eventually found it! You must make a reservation for this place, else you have a very small chance of getting a table. The food here is excellent and authentic, yet sophisticated. Uni soba and salmon roe over rice is amazing!! I'm not a huge fan of uni, but it was soo good! The salmon was so buttery and creamy..delicious! The only think is that the portions are on the smaller side, but definitely worth it if you have the money to spend. We also got the black sesame creme boule which was great! Who would have though of black sesame (although it did look the black sesame creme by itself looked unappetizing, it tasted great)? Very creative!! I can't wait to come back and try more dishes here!

If you're looking for an authentic Japanese food experience, this is as good as it gets. From the sake to the Japanese toilets, Sakagura nails every detail. Every single dish here is subtle and carefully prepared, exactly as the best Japanese food should be. The sake list is extensive, and the servers are quite knowledgeable about the entire selection. For a "fine dining" experience, this is about as close to Tokyo as you can get from New York. That said, you should know what you're getting when you come here. I came here before visiting Japan and couldn't appreciate the quality. Just don't expect any Americanized flavors.

This was amazing. Really, not a single complaint from a table of five people with VERY different standards and opinions. We tried a lot of the items on the menu, and literally everything was outstanding. The items that got the most praise from my group were: Braised pork belly Creme brulee Kobe beef Sashimi sampler Fried veggies plate Everything else was outstanding as well. I could write a lot more about each thing we ordered, but I only can use the same "delicious" and "amazing" adjectives for each item. Bottom line - check it out. You won't regret it.

So far my favorite Japanese restaurant in NYC! Food was better than expected. Very traditional, spot-on Japanese flavors. Everything we ordered was excellent and full of umami: ONSEN TAMAGO : ?Soft Boiled Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup MAGURO TARTAR GINDARA YUAN YAKI : ?Cod in Sweet Soy Sauce - Highly recommended GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : ?Beef Tongue - Highly recommended SAKE OYAKO DON: the salmon was really fatty and oily (in a good way) I also highly recommend a BEEF FILET dish that I can't find on their website now. It's pieces of high quality beef cooked on a hot stone. It was probably the most memorable dish of the night. We also had the SESAME CREAM BRULEE to finish the meal. Their Sake selections were excellent. We got two carafes of different kinds of Sake (sweet/dry) and they were both delicious. Our server was attentive and gave good food recommendations.

The only reason that I'm giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 is the service. Mind you, there was nothing wrong with the service but it just wasn't spectacular. The food was AMAAZZZINNGGGGG. Everything was cooked to perfection. Out of the 10 or so dishes that we all ordered (6 of us, the dishes are small, like tapas style); there was literally not one dish that i did not enjoy or thought could have been improved. The place is a little expensive so i wouldn't go on the regular, but I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND it for special occasions or if you just ball out like that haha. It's also a true Sake bar. I'm not a connoisseur of sake but one of the people I was with is and said hes never seen such a comprehensive list and some of the really quality Sakes were cheaper at Sakagura than in the stores!

Just as delicious as I remembered-- the clear winners were the pork belly and beef tongue. We also got the kimchee don, which is still one of my most favorite dishes of all time. Service was attentive, as expected, and we were able to enjoy a nice conversation because of the cozy ambiance. My friend was sick (not because of the food), so he couldn't finish his kimchee don. And technically, we're not supposed to take any leftovers home, but the restaurant made an exception for us. (Thank you, Sakagura!)

This place is 2 of 5 stars for the following reasons: - Food was good, not amazing = -1 star - Supposed to open at 11:30am as the website, signs, and even security guard at the building said. ?They didn't open til 12pm. ?Kept people waiting. ?In NY, ?you should know better than waste someone's busy, precious time = ?-1 star - For a Japanese place that considers themselves premium, instead of nice chopsticks, they use cheap throwaway wooden ones that gave me a splinter and cut my lip. ?Hard to enjoy my meal when my lip was killing me = - 1 star

Indeed a hidden gem, located in the basement of an office building, it was a near miss. Based on some reliable rumours, some friends and I decided to try out their 30-sets-a-day Higawari Hayashi Rice Don, which was very competitively priced. The set itself looked impressive for $11.50, with a bowl of hashed beef rice and cold soba noodles with dip. The rice was cooked to perfection while the beef literally melted in my mouth. Though the soba was a tad over-cooked to my preference, the soy-sauce based dip formed a satisfying combination. With the right portions of wasabi, spring onion and orange peel in the dip, the soba's natural taste is brought out well, with the peel adding a tinge of freshness. They only serve this set on Fridays this month, so go early to have it. And if you are there between 11.30am and noon, you can get a stamp on the loyalty card which entitles you to free desserts and the like. Definitely a good deal, I think! The service was a charm, albeit the waiters were clearer better at Japanese than English. Nonetheless, the hot towels before and after the meals really completes the entire experience. It was a pity that we did not try any sake since it was the middle of the day but I'll update this review once I have tried the sake too.

It was kinda hard to decide at first because there were no pictures or phone service to check yelp. We had to pick food the old school way!! ?Thankfully everything we had was great and presented nicely. ? Pork belly- We each got one, which probably filled us up the most Duck wrapped around scallions- ?Duh, I ordered duck!!

Why are all the best Japanese restaurants in basements of office buildings? ?We were reminded of our search for Mizutani in Tokyo (one of the best, if not THE best sushi bar in Tokyo) as we were directed down to the basement of this office building by the evening security guard. ? We were not very warmly welcomed, as the maitre'd pointed out to us that we were more than 15 minutes late for our reservation, and asked us to wait a minute while she figured out where to put us as she apparently had given our table away. ?I was particularly annoyed by the welcome when I was led into the dining room and saw that there were plenty of available tables to be had. ? That being said, the actual dinner service was quite good, and the food was as good as advertised. ?Our favorites were the beef tongue (so tender and flavorful), the tori tsukune (chicken meatballs), and the jaga dango (light, just slightly sweet, mashed potato donuts, essentially). ?Yes, you can find tsukune at any izakaya or yakitori place, but these were maybe the best I've ever tried. ?The jaga dango was simply like nothing I've ever tried before. The gindara yuan yaki (soy marinated cod) and jidori shioyaki (grilled organic free range chicken) were other standout dishes. ?With so much talk about how small the dishes were, we definitely went overboard, and ended up with too much food. ?We were actually quite surprised at the healthy portions of jidori shioyaki and beef tongue that were served. ? Oh well, you can do much worse than leftover tori tsukune for breakfast the next day.

Tucked away underground, Sakagura is a hidden gem of a Japanese restaurant. Upon finally reaching the end of the stairs, you'll be greeted with an amazing ambiance that only a Japanese restaurant can really prepare for it's customers. Walls lined with fine sake and plum wine and Japanese businessmen hurrying in from work to cheer a beer. From the clientele and servers, you know this place is a legitimate Japanese restaurant. ? I just had Salmon Roe and Ume Onigiri and one of the specials of the day (Soba with Sea Urchin). It was one of the few times I've had sea urchin, and to those who haven't had it before, it's a bit hard to explain. Imagine a melt-in-your-mouth piece of salmon sashimi, ground into a fine buttery paste and that only touches the surface of flavor your taste buds will enjoy. Staff and waiter were friendly enough. For such a place, Japanese is obviously their first language so you may have to repeat your order once or twice, but they are helpful no matter what. I saw two Caucasian businessmen who seemed very new to sake and the waiter seemed quite helpful to them in explaining the different varieties and what they may enjoy. Overall, the decor enough leaves for an unforgettable dining experience. The food will set you back about $20-50+, but for a place like this it is definitely worth your money. They certainly don't have Japanese restaurants like this back in Southern California, so if you're ever out in New York and what authentic Japanese food, definitely try out Sakagura!

This is a rather average Japanese restaurant in NYC. We tried the Tuna Tartar for appetizer, Pork Belly, Soba, and for dessert, the Chocolate cake. The Tuna Tartar was very pretty and fresh, I loved this one! The pork belly was outrageously fatty, I've never encountered anything like it before. Almost a little too much for me, but at least it was well prepared. The Soba wasn't your average buckwheat noodle, but cold ramen?? It was pretty bad... But thank god for the dessert, chocolate pudding cake, with a side of ice cream and raspberry sauce, ended the dinner well. They also have a HUGE selection of sake, and I enjoyed it. Try their recommended ones!

I've avoided writing a review for long enough... I've been going to Sakagura now for over 5 years now. ?Over all they are one of my top 10 restaurants of NY because of consistency, service, alcohol (sake) selection, ambiance (true izakaya hideaway) and most of all food. ? I always recommend them with this preface in mine: ?this is not a sushi "joint", they don't do rolls, and don't do sake bombs of any kind here. ?This is solid Japanese food and drink for the connoisseur.

Sakagura, brought to you by TIC Group of Cha-An, Sobaya, Shabu-Tatsu and Decibel just to name a few, is tucked away where no one would expect a sake bar to exist-in the basement of a high-rise office building. Actually such subterranean establishments are pretty common in Japan, and once you step inside Sakagura, you'll feel like drinking chilled rice wine, accompanied by traditional izakaya fare, like many "salary men" do in the Land of the Rising Sun. The menu is vast, so prepare to be overwhelmed-with around fifty dishes and over 200 bottles of sake to choose from, it may be wise to study their menu a bit beforehand. Contrary to some reviews of Sakagura floating around on the 'net, the servers are literally just "servers"-their poor English speaking skills won't get you far in the recommendations department. But as long as you're not a picky eater, you can't go wrong with just blind-picking here, as most of the dishes are as good as they get in New York City. If you're dining with a significant other, don't get stingy-choose four or five items to share. Admittedly, a place like Sakagura is hard to review as the food menu seems to be all over the place and is reminiscent of eating at a Chinese restaurant without having a f*cking clue as to what you're ordering. However, what makes this place stand out among the plethora of izakayas in the City is that none of the dozen or so dishes we tried tasted bad. That kind of consistency in any bar's kitchen is rare and highly applaudable. Furthermore, Sakagura's expansive sake selection will encourage many repeated visits, especially for those seeking cold drinks during the hot months of summer who are either a.) sick of drinking white wine or b.) feel their sexuality is on the line when ordering glasses of rose. This sake bar is not without quibbles though-short operating hours and its desolate location almost guarantee a quick end to your night out. Perhaps Sakagura is the perfect place to have a blind date-if things start getting weird, you can always ask for the check and go home right away, without the guilt of not having taken your date elsewhere. One Drink Ahead

If you've ever wondered what it's like living in Japan, you might want to make a trip over to Sakagura in Midtown New York. Granted, you won't see the demographic of Tokyo, but it's pretty damn close. The authenticity of this place reminds me of a cozy japanese ramen house with an encyclopedic array of sake to choose from. It's interesting to note the different flavors on the menu, inspired both by authentic Japanese fare to more modern and Western takes on the classic dishes you might see in a Japanese home (a wealthy one). And then with a neat finish, the restaurant serves "tapas" style dishes so you could share with the whole crew. If you do decide to go, you absolutely need to capitalize on the entire menu by taking a holistic approach. Try the Kamo Roast (duck wrapped scallions) and then maybe have a little Gyu Miso Nigomi (miso ribs). Move on to the Yuba Shumai (pork dumplings) and finish with their homemad Nihachi Soba. As always, with japanese food, it never weighs you down. Get yo drank on with a nice carafe of sake (waiter/waitress can recommend which one) and end up wishing you were born in Japan :) Of course, it'll never be as good as the real thing... but for a restaurant that even has a robotic toilet.. it's well worth the trip. Enjoy! 5/5

Oh, how I heart you, Sakagura. ?Why must you always be so crowded? ?I know, I know, it's because you are so yummy. ?Stupid question. ?The food is excellent and the sake selection is fantastic. ?While I don't have a go-to sake, the servers are more than knowledgeable on the different sakes and which one would satisfy your tastes. ?I don't think I've had the same sake each time I have gone. Do try: ?Gyu miso nikomi (stewed beef), Kama roast (duck), Buta kakuni (pork belly), Daikon salad (refreshing!), Miso eggplant. ?I for one, am a huge fan of rice....so I never pass on a Mentai onigiri (spicy cod roe rice ball). ?The desserts are the perfect ending to a succulent meal. ?Black sesame creme brulee and the soufle are surefire wins.

You begin your journey meandering the streets around Grand Central, past the delis and the nondescript parking garages. Amidst the random midtown office buildings, and down the stairs past security, is a haven for Japanese expats and sake lovers alike. The ambiance is intimate, cool, and secretive. If the wood paneling, evening tea house decor doesn't faze you, the delicate small plates surely will. A whole grilled pike mackerel, tender and fresh. A cool and refreshing, yet savory poached Tamago (egg) in dashi with uni and sprouts. A kaisen kimchee don - chopped sashimi with kimchee over rice - was simply divine - spicy fresh fish that had the consistency of butter and unbelievable flavor. And to finish, a pear millefielle. The earl gray ice cream was superb - so much so that it almost overshadowed the juicy pear and crisp phyllo and cream. Now, being adventurous doesn't always pay off so do heed your waiter. The only dish I wasn't enthusiastic about was ika shikara - raw squid with squid liver. Not that it was poorly prepared but more because its probably an acquired taste I wasn't anticipating. That said, the waiter was kind, very knowledgeable and really enhanced our meal. While he couldn't dissuade me from trying the Ika, he did make a fabulous sake recommendation. In addition, the price may seem a smidge high - especially while partaking of the amazing sake selection - but I believe its worth every cent.

Great place to go if you're looking for Japanese tapas and want a slightly more upscale or mature environment versus the places on St Marks and you want more than just yakitori skewers. We drank a bunch of excellent cold sake from an extensive list. Stand out dishes included the stewed beef tongue, the grilled beef tongue skewers, the duck (though it is a cold dish and had a slight liver flavor hint to me somehow), the egg stews (Chawan Mushi - more silky than other egg stews, almost like a soon doo boo chigae silkiness). ?Assorted sashimi was also awesome - especially the uni, subtle and yum. ?Rice balls were not grilled, so not as interesting to me (they won't bring you just a bowl of rice for some retarded reason). ?The beef slices to cook at table on hot stone was fun but not mind blowing in flavor like the tongues. ?I believe I also had the Onsen Tamago (soft boiled egg with uni and roe in cold soup) and I slurped it down - yummy. Good spot for groups to share Japanese tapas, you can make reservations, and it doesn't feel cramped.

This is a definitely a hidden gem. It was downstairs in a basement. Inside was a posh and modern Japanese restaurant. They have many cool dishes and pretty authentic from what I've tasted. Portions were your typical tapas size...I would return if I was ever in the area for dinner.

Sakagura definitely takes you back to Japan with the "Irasshaimase" greetings! ?Everyone at the restaurant says it very loudly! ?I came here for dinner and it was quite pricey ($155 for two or $60 pp omokasa) If you make reservations for 4 or more, you are accommodated with a private room. ?Otherwise, you are like me and are seated by the grilling station which isnt that all bad. ?Your clothes do stink, but it's worth it! Sakagura is Japanese tapas. ?Their menu is always changing, but we had ordered : octupus with cucumbers in kimchi sauce, cold tofu (amazing), ?monk fish liver, and fried organic chicken (so crispy). ?I recommend being adventurous and sampling a little bit of everything. ?If you aren't too sure, ask your server as ours was extremely informative. ?I also suggest getting their house special which takes 40 minutes to make - their stone pot rice dish with anything toppings. ?We got eel with ours and it was delicious. ?Others ordered sashimi, but you can get that anywhere. There sake and desserts were outstanding (pumpkin cheese cake and fire creme brulee). Enjoy the experience and definitely give the bathroom a shot! ?It's electric toilet seat in the ladies room is quite exciting.

Came here on a Friday night around 930. ? Almost walked by the place. . you have to walk though a commercial building past the elevators and down a set of stairs to get to the restaurant. Although the restaurant was in the basement, definitely did not feel confined at all. ?I really liked the decor. ?Never been to Japan, but I would imagine that's what it would like if I visited. ? As it is a Japanese tapas place, be sure to order enough food since the portions are on the small side. ?I was with a party of five, so we each ordered 2-3 dishes each. Must order the crab and rice dish. ?I think it's the most expensive thing on the menu besides sushi sashimi, but it's definitely worth the price. It was served in a large pot, which the waiter scooped out for us into small rice bowls. ?With 2 orders of that dish everyone had a full bowl of rice. ?Without the rice I'm sure everyone would still be hungry at the end of the meal. Overall it was a solid meal, nothing spectacular, but with the ambiance, good food and service, ?a place worth returning to for dinner. ?The highlights were the washu beef , buta and tori karaage ( fried pork and chicken), uni soba, beef tongue, tuna tartar, and the sesame creme br?lée (Delicious). Everything else we ordered was 'okay'. ?As with any tapas place, the prices add up quickly. ?For 2 people, sake and food could easily add up to 100 bucks. ? The meal came up to 60 bucks each, including sake and tip- not too bad for a 5 people. I read on other reviews that they have a good selection of sake. Unfortunately, the only disappointment was our sake.. We asked our waiter to recommend one for us. ?It wasn't a hit for the table, but it wasnt bad either. ?Some people complained it was salty. ?No complaints from me. ? Anyway, sakagura would be a good place for a date or drinks. ?Will be back for a date now that I know what items to order.

I've mentioned Sakagura in at least a couple of my other reviews because really, it's the perfect benchmark, standing for a restaurant that consistently delivers. Seriously, should a restaurant provide comparable taste, service and atmosphere with Sakagura's consistency, I'd be a huge fan of it as well. I love, love, love my meals here, especially paired with one or two bottles/carafes of their recommended sake. ? The menu is extensive and the dishes are designed to be shared (~ 7 to 10 selections between two people)... although I guarantee that you'll find some that you'll just really want all to yourself (e.g., the fatty and delicious stewed pork and the onsen tamago (gosh, the brilliance of the mind that put together a soft boiled egg with ikura and uni!)). The eggplant with three kinds of miso, the fluke carpaccio, the tuna tartar, and the shrimp balls with almonds are also some of my favorites. In addition, there's always a seasonal specials page that should not be skipped. Reservations are good to have... this place is no longer a secret.

I've never been to Japan before. This is a saddening confession, but upon stepping into the basement of 211 E. 43rd Street, I think I've gotten as close to Japan as I'll ever be. First, a disclaimer: Yes, the journey to this restaurant is somewhat confusing. You may be tempted to turn around and head back, daunted by the dark passageway and the lack of signage. Don't. I called a few days beforehand to make a reservation for my group of four. Yes, I realize that there's an OpenTable option, but I've never had much success with it. Call ahead, earlier if possible, to secure your seats. Thus, my friends and I came here on Tuesday night for our planned dinner. We were seated in the midst of the main room, where we could see Japanese businessmen conversing in a booth, a few couples seated near the bar that was well-stocked with sake and other forms of alcohol. With the ambiance, the wooden tables set with chopsticks in front of us, and the ceiling dotted with dim lights, It felt like we had been transported to the other side of the world. The menu is, without a doubt, overwhelming. We stuck to some of the classics and between the four us, selected six dishes total. Our waitress was helpful in explaining some of the plates we weren't sure about and throughout the night, she checked up on us several times to make sure we had gotten what we had ordered as well as refilling our glasses. The only downside to the service was that it seemed that our plates came out haphazardly and too close together; I would have appreciated if they'd spaced them out a bit more. But onto the important part: the food. The Buta Kakuni was a definite must-order; the sizable piece of pork belly came in a small bowl and was as soft and tender as tofu; a true melt-in-your-mouth dish. We also ordered the Agedashi Tofu; three slices of tofu that had a slightly crisp-fried skin in a soy sauce-flavored broth. There were several bonito flakes scattered on top as well, and though it was a simple dish, the flavor really came through. We also had the Tori Karaage, which I thoroughly enjoyed; after all, who doesn't like deep-fried chicken? Finally, the onigiri were surprisingly savory for being what they were; I had the spicy salmon cod roe, and the addition of the nori and pickles that it was served with made for a great balance. There were some dishes that I didn't quite appreciate as much though. The Yuba Shumai also seemed delicious on paper, though was slightly disappointing in real life; they were more like meatballs than the shumai I was used to, and lacked any special flavor despite being dipped in the accompanying sauce. The Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku consisted of six small pieces of eggplant with sauces on each; I didn't really get to enjoy the flavor or texture of this dish either. I have experienced here a problem I have found at numerous other tapas or "small plates" restaurants; the portion to price ratio may not be worth it for everyone. I paid about $20 for my portion of the meal and felt like I could still have used another plate or two of food. Nonetheless, I had a wonderful dinner here and a greater appreciation of Japanese cuisine.

this place is a gem hidden in the basement of an office building. seriously one of the best japanese restaurants out there. 1) pork belly--to die for. it feel apart in my mouth and the meat just melted. also a huge portion for just $5!! 2) the sea urchin cold ramen....omfg. this is probably one of the best dishes ive ever tasted. absolutely perfect. it was delicious and the urchin soup was to die for. its got this silky flavor...yum. 3) duck app was pretty decent. ?it was a tad over cooked, but flavors were great, the saltiness marinated all the way through the whole duck. 4) rice balls--very fresh salmon roe, rice had great texture and had he vinegar and salt taste in the rice (huge plus) a must try.

It's rare that I'm hanging in this neighbourhood so I don't go to this restaurant as much as I probably should... The basement of an office building seems an unlikely place to find such a nice restaurant with such delicious food. I've enjoyed everything I've sampled off the menu - oddly something that really stands out in my memory is the chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert.

Simply amazing. Even though there's a sign outside the building, we still had difficulty finding this restaurant. Once you're inside, you go downstairs, and it's a different world. It's big, but still has that low-key, underground feel which I loved. I'm glad we sat by the bar - the bartender made great food and drink recommendations. Aside from St. Mark's, my sake knowledge is very limited. Based on what we thought we would like, he brought us three different cold sakes. It was crisp, semi-sweet, dry sake which I really liked - and I thought I only liked hot sake! We ordered the fried shrimp, Sashoku Nasu Dengaku (grilled Japanese eggplants with three different kinds of miso - eggyolk, spinach, sweet red), and 2 orders of yellowtail sashimi. I'm really picky about my sashimi - I only like it thinly sliced - but even so, the way it was fileted & the quality was absolutely delicious. It practically melted in my mouth. It's not a cheap place to go, but the price is worth the quality and service.

The food was delicious and we really enjoyed the sake tasting. The small portions give you the opportunity to sample many different dishes without breaking the bank. Our two three dishes were the pork belly in broth and the grilled squid. The Sashimi was a little disappointing. At $50+ for 10 pieces we would have expected more. Anyway, we had a fabulous evening and learned a lot about sake.

The service: ?Extremely friendly and helpful waitstaff. 5 stars. The food: Sake - We couldn't decide what to drink so the waitress was more than happy to give her 2 cents on the sake. ?We were pleased. Fluke carpaccio - " Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe, and Shiso Leaf. ?"AMAZING. ?It's a shame that this was the first dish that came out because everything that came after this were completely overshadowed. 10 stars. Onsen Tamago - Soft boiled egg w/ uni in cold dashi. ?5 stars. Grilled fish - This was off of their specials of the day menu. ?I don't remember what kind of fish it was. ?It was simply seasoned with some salt and a light dipping sauce. ?Simple but delicious. ?4 stars. Karage - Fried chicken. ?Nothing special. ?2 stars. Buta Kakuni - "Sakagura's Special" Gelatinous soft pork belly in a warm dashi broth. ?The pork completely fell apart. ?So good! ?5 stars. Kama Roast - Duck wrapped around scallions. ?It was ok. ?I would not get this again. ? ?3 stars. Gyutan Yawaraka Ni - Beef tongue stew - The menu didn't describe this dish other than stating it was beef tongue so I thought this was going to be a bbq dish. ?It was actually a stew. ?It was delicious and very filling and reminded me of Korean galbi jjim. ?However I wouldn't get this again. ?It would be great as an entree for 1 person but for me, if I am going to come to a restaurant like this, I want to try a bunch of small plates instead of eating 1 big entree. ?3 stars. Onigiri wrapped w/ mackerel - So simple but so good. ?5 stars. Black sesame creme brulee with ice cream - 5 stars. The cost: You get what you pay for! ?I expected the bill to be $200+ but it came out to about $120. Overall: ?I will come back! ?Everyone should try it.

So, I've been here twice and It's a mere MEH for me. First off, you better NOT be a big eater because MOST of their dishes are about the size of your palm (not shaquille o'neal palms, but average population) - some about the size of two of your fingers put together. They are more of japanese "tapas" so the portions are small and on average these tapas range from $6-9. The more expensive ones like the tuna tartar with caviar are over $10, but still about the size of your palm. I went to this place for dinner twice and surprisingly, they are pretty loud. The music is actually louder than what I expected of the ambiance because people come on dates to nibble in an expensive restaurant to impress their dates or group of friends who wants to venture a little out there. I do have to admit that their food is quite fresh, but honestly if I"m paying around $10 per dish about the size of my palm, I EXPECT IT TO BE TOP NOTCH! Their (raw) fluke and tuna dishes melt in your mouth as they marry with daikon and caviar. Their meat balls have tasty sauces that topped them. Hence, my rating is 2 stars because the portions are NOT satisfactory and for me (or normal people I think) to be happy, you would easily break $100 easy. Additionally, if I am going to spend THAT much money, I'd prefer a better atmosphere where it's more intimate and fish to be even better, because i have to admit that I have had better tuna tartar and fluke for about the same price, if not cheaper.

This is a very unique place. ?As you've read in others' reviews, its in the basement of an office building. ?During dinner/late night hours the place is crawling with Japanese business men and feels like you've taken a trip to Tokyo. ?Lunch is typical mid-town working crowd (not as cool). They have a very extensive sake menu and visiting this place really made me truly appreciate sake beyond my sake bomb exposure. ?Unfiltered sake is amazing! ?Like mothers milk. For dinner I got a bunch of sushi. ?All their fish is very fresh. ?I also gave sea urchin another chance...still cant do it. For lunch I've had their lunch special a few times, $30 tower of food. ?Pretty good, but their chocolate molten cake for desert is the best part.

Great izakaya / Japanese tapas style dishes. ?Pork belly was good, but not as tender as I would have preferred. ?Sashimi and the other dishes were all very fresh and well prepared. ?Average cost of dishes is also very reasonable. Only drawback: ?cell phone reception and location in a basement makes it a bit odd. ?However, sometimes it's nice to not be bothered by calls / texts during dinner with friends.

One star because there was no option for zero star or negative starts. I've been to this place a few times in the past and was not really empresses but was not bad to the point of comment either but this recent trip make me think if I have to go through that, I have to get paid to come here. Not worth it. I read some of the good reviews here and seems like written by Non- Japanese. I am Japanese. Some restaurant, like the one sushi place across the street from this one has excellent reviews but none of my Japanese like. Decor might be nice but you don't eat the wall and this place is totally lacks fundamental things like good services. *NYC sanitation rating is ?B. It's been a while since this program started and the restaurants had plenty of time to change the problem and get A as you might have seen. Some take out Chinese that got C now has A. This place still has B. I don't know if NYC agency wants them to grill sashimi to give A but someone does not want to change what government thinks health risk. * Avoid if you are group, they seem to like max 4. Tables arranged that way. We went there group of 6 and when we asked them to be group of 8, the hostess, two waiters needed to gather together to discuss about possibilities. They had huge attitude when they finally moved us to the bigger table but throughout the night, I saw more than 3 tables empty. If they don't want us to be a bigger group, just say it, we even offered them to be split up to 4x4 that attitude was very unnecessary. *food are good but nothing outstanding. Super overpriced. I feel sad that Japanese restaurant w decent food tend to be overpriced and cheap place, you'd only get microwaved dumplings and edamame. SHould be happy medium. I can have this type of food half or 1/3 in Japan but we're ny. I mean, I get how sushi becomes more expensive but some of the food here is like typical Japanese home cooking type which does not have to be that expensive....such as fried tofu, hijiki in a tiny tiny bowel, thin sliced daikon salad w mayo ?etc. Nothing spectacular at all. *Wat staff is horrible We have two wait staff here and there but both them had huge attitude. They might have misunderstood being arrogant and unfriendly would make them look like stoic ?old school male waiters? I asked "Have you tried this sake" "yes. I tried them all " "Then? how is it?" "This is better, pointing other one without specific reasoning besides that one was much more expensive." ?Another occasion, as asked them to bring one more glass, the waiter asked "Just one more? one, right ?" His tone of voice was "Are you definitely sure that you only need one more? I am not feeling like I am going to make one more trip to bring another glass, it's got to be the last one!!!" Seriously, No doubt this is the worst service that I ever had. ?I wanted to give least tip but since it was already big group, they already added 20% tip, they did not deserve. I would NRVER EVER go back to this place. ?I would only recommend this place if you want to impressed with the decor which I don't think its such a big deal and wanted to be treated second class citizen by their waiters, go ahead!

There really isn't much more that I can add to the hundreds of wonderful reviews other Yelpers have already left this great restaurant. I can, however, give some in sight to the level of demand. I had called to make a reservation for two a week beforehand for a Friday night dinner for two at 6pm. The woman on the other end of the line told me that the table was already booked for 8:30pm and we would need to give it back then. I was fine with that considering how we're both fast eaters. When we arrived, they were just opening but I noticed that every single table had a 'reserved' sign on top of it - even the bar seats. When the boyfriend and I left at around 8pm, a couple walked in and asked for a table. When they told the hostess that they did not have a reservation and asked if the wait was long, the hostess didn't even bother to answer. It's Sakagura at 8pm. Do you think the wait is long? Now onto the food - here are some of my must-haves: 1. Salmon Don - I don't usually like salmon roe but I gobbled every single last bubble up. 2. Pork Belly - get one order to share, it's not large but it's enough to get a good taste without feeling gross 3. Grilled Cod Fish - very flavorful and very unlike any other grilled cod I've ever tasted For a more in depth review and pics, check out my blog: http://cookiesandnoodles…

This is one of the nicer Japanese tapas place in the city. For you folks that only ever equate Japanese food with Sushi, you will be disappointed. ?The sushi here is fine, but it's a bit of a waste. As this place is in the basement of a building with no sign except at the top of the stairs of the basement, it goes on my Hide & Seek list. ? The food is excellent. This was my first try of Japanese rice balls. ?They do a great job here. ?The beef tongue skewers were great. I also agree with the dish choices of Franklin B's reviews. ? The saki selection is fantastic and the service is typically polite Japanese. ?If you're taking out native Japanese peeps, you'll do fine with this as a choice. ?Definitely worth a try.

We were randomly walking around on a Friday night looking to go to a good place for dinner in midtown. I looked this place up, and after going through some hallways we ended up in the basement that seemed like a world of its own. It was quite busy, and we were amused that there was such a popular restaurant in the basement. Firstly, the ambiance is great. Its a vibrant place with a rustic feel that ranges between traditional japanese and casual. The waiters were very nice and responsive. I'm vegetarian, and she was very helpful in finding something I would like. The sake selection is frankly overwhelming for a noob like me, and again she was very helpful in finding us something that we might (and did) enjoy. Food is tapas style, with lots of small plates. The range of flavors I got from my food were just outstanding. It was the fourth of july for my taste buds. To top it off, we had the chocolate souffle for dessert which was amazing as well. The icing on the cake was that the check was totally reasonable. I would surely go back to this place, and recommend it to my friends. All in all, a wonderful evening thanks to my discovery of Sakagura.

There's something about hidden places that really pumps me up. No, the entrance to this place is not dissimilar to getting your car from a parking garage. But once you glide down that staircase, you enter this magical world of delectable dishes. Japanese tapas style. On our Valentine's Day excursion, we easily ordered 8 mini plates. Among the top were the fluke and pork belly. We also got rice, which paired greatly with the succulent sauce from the pork belly. Did I mention how tasty this was? I can imagine my Grandma slow-simmering this dish all afternoon to intensify the sweet and savory flavors. If only my Grandma were Japanese....and lived close by. The decor is pretty major. What? Ten foot samurai mask hanging above our heads? We are totally not in Kansas anymore.

A friend recommended this place after she had what she claims to be the best souffle in all of New York. It was pretty darn good! Service was good, staff was friendly. The bathrooms were awesome! (you'll see what I mean). The only bad thing was that the table was too tiny when they served everything on giant plates! HAHA. Try the beef tongue and the waitress' recommendation of the most expensive sake. LOL ... never again. I do not know how to savor it so I gulped it. There goes $40 for 1/3 of a glass! I will definitely go back for the food, and souffle =)

Let's start with the drinks - Our server was a big help, we described what we liked and did not like - She brought us out two bottles and let us try it and then we chose the ones we liked (we did this two times so got a chance to try out four kinds of sake). Food - Delicious, the sashimi was amazing, the soba noodles with uni & uni sauce was great, beef tataki - awesome, pork belly - yum, the reason why i only gave four stars, one of the specials was a snow crab with rice item - it was only ok. Overall, would recommend - it is pricey but what isn't in NYC.

Love this place! The interior was gorgeous. We made a reservation at six when it opened and most other tables looked reserved as well, so I recommend doing the reservation. The place was pretty packed even for a Monday night. We had the wagyu beef (so tender and tasty), tuna tartar (this had a more subtle tuna flavor which I wish were stronger, but it was still good), the buta kakuni pork belly (amazing! It came in layers with the fat on top and the juicy pork underneath). The prices were very reasonable for the quality, especially the pork belly. And of course, the bathroom is awesome with an Asian bidet found in a little hut in the middle of the restaurant. Service was also great - we left something behind and they called us to let us know afterward. Just a reminder that the restaurant is down the stairs in the building and there's no reception.

a hidden spot, in a boring area of New York. Staff really friendly. we chooses some disches and asked waiter for some advice of more disches. She recommended only the most expensive courses, we chooses her advices. To be honest the disches that she recommend was out of taste and very boring and expensive The courses the we chooses was by our selves OK, but i think this place is def not worth such good reviews, try Ippudo instead so much better. We left the place without any tip! thats what happen when you fool vikings from the North!!!

I agree with Mona--4.5. Important tip: Zero cell reception at this place. The first time I went I was with a person who was on call and we had to leave because no one could get a signal. On to the review. I don't eat meat, just putting that out there, and every veggie and fish dish I got last night killed it. ?The edamame had this subtle smoked salt thing going on that was a great way to get things started. Then the eel. Yum. I thought since it was cold it might be a bit weird but it was great--firm and sweet and well balanced with the nori and cucumber. On to some squid--grilled amazingly with zero chewiness. The almond crusted shrimp rolls were heavenly with this nutty toasty flavor. You couldn't tell they were shrimp--it may as well have been chicken--and I actually think that was great and added to the dish. Their black cod was just what you'd expect--buttery and falling apart in your mouth. Two quarter fillets were just the right amount too. All throughout this experience our waiter/bartender (we ate at the bar) suggested two great junmai sakes. Since you can order half bottles and quarter bottles we took some chances and man did they pay off. We didn't try dessert but I'd imagine if we did we'd be equally impressed!

Really amazing food, no wonder it's packed on any typical night. It was a good thing we came late around 10 on a Monday night and it was nice and empty. Everything on the menu looks unusual and delicious, but I finally decided to go with the "Sake Oyako Don" which are fillets of fresh salmon sashimi and salmon roe steeped in soy sauce served atop a bowl of rice and served with miso soup. It was absolutely perfect. The salmon roe crushed into the rice was full of umami and I could not have asked for better silky salmon. The miso soup was also great, rich and nourishing. There was a side of cucumbers which I dumped into the miso soup, and some wasabi as well but I didn't use that. No need to mess with what's already perfect! I love that it's located in the basement of an office building - you would never think such a lovely oasis exists in such banal environment. Sake bottles line the walls and the blue cotton curtains and wooden furniture are wonderfully Japanese. The sake list is quite extensive, so for sake lovers, this is the place to go. Finally, we topped off our excellent meals with a chocolate soufflé. Oh my. A little spoonful of vanilla ice cream, a dip into the warm gooey chocolate soufflé and a little dab of sweet raspberry sauce on the side... I don't even remember what happened next.

Went in with high expectations, came out with a big smile on my face, my beautiful girlfriend by my side, and a very happy tummy. We sat by the bar, and were instantly greeted by our friendly waiter. Our sake knowledge was quite limited to say the least, but with the help of our enthusiastic waiter, we chose the perfect bottle of sake that complemented well with the fried shrimp, grilled eggplant, and the yellowtail sashimi we had ordered. Highly recommended, amazing girl, oops i mean food, a wonderful "underground" ambience, and a very memorable experience...walked out of the restaurant feeling like a million dollars, partially due to the sake, and mostly due to the great company :)

4.5. Fine dining hidden isakaya gem with endless sake collection and superb, flawless presentation of food and sake. Who knew sake could look so beautiful? Each carafe order of sake is distinctly presented with a flower petal and a special case. ?Since sake is so easy to drink, the carafe size can be quite deceiving. ?If you can drink, ordering the large is more worthwhile. Everything we tried tasted good, but by far my favorites were the pork belly, grilled Japanese squid, tuna tar-tare and their black sesame creme brulee. ?But if I could go back again and just choose two items, I'd choose their tuna tar-tare and the black sesame creme brulee. Their tuna tar-tare is heavenly, out beating all the fine dining restaurants in the city! Its perfection is attributed to its exceptional quality and freshness and unique two layers-- the tuna with yuzu (citrusy flavor) and caviar. ? And the black sesame creme brulee exemplies the magic of fusing Asian and French/English cuisine. There's nothing like it which is why is also so special and to die for! Did I mention how cool the restroom is? ?Sakagura is seriously all about pleasant surprises, starting with its location and ending with the restroom experience. ?Only reason why I am not giving this a five is because I can't come here as often as I'd like---it is the priciest isakaya in Manhattan and worth dining for special occasions. ? Note: Be sure you don't go out after dining here because you leave smelling like bbq.

What a hidden jewel. A great idea, Japanese tapas!!! ?The food was absolutely delicious & the staff was exceptional. ?I was in New York celebrating my 44th birthday and was craving Japanese food so we searched & found this little treasure. ? My mother, cousin and I dined on chicken meatballs, ?chicken with root vegetables, pork tenderloins, chocolate souffle, black cod & a couple of other dishes & they were all delectable. ?The next time I am in New York I will definitely dine there again. ?A must try!!

Hi there, I'm the guy you hired to be your guide for Sakagura. I'm not much to look at, but do you want the guy with the rock hard abs and chiseled jawline bringing all of you in and only half of you out? Or do you want my ugly mug to show you the way and make sure you're around to celebrate another one of your kids birthdays? Pleasure meeting you. Sakagura is a hidden paradise of dinery and I'm one of the few who've managed to find out that it actually exists, the building it's hidden under, and the path through the Maze of Hallways and false doorways inside. It's hard to find because there's only a tiny sign out front and you'll NEVER guess where it is in the building, but I'll get you there. But before we begin our journey, a word of warning: Know what you want to order. Do your homework. The sake is top-notch. If you're a veteran, you'll know the rice entrees are delicious and homemade noodle items will save you from hunger. The desserts, however, are the treasure trove that all the secrecy and inconspicuousness of this facility protect. Everything else in the menu is just a highly flavorful and pretty diversion. The chefs release their food less frequently than over-protective fathers release their daughters into the wild. Items ordered can be served with 15-20 minute gaps in between so be aware that if you weren't hungry when you got there, you will be. Oh you will be. Ok, let's head out.

Maybe it was because I had too high expectations for Sakagura due to the Yelp reviews or due to the fact that I recently (well about 3 months ago) had been to another izakaya that was in Hawaii that every dish that I tried was amazing and I wanted to find another one like that here in NYC but this one wasn't up to par. I'd brought my sister here for her birthday dinner. Sakagura doesn't do birthday specials just so you know. The bill came out to around $150 which included 5 dishes, 2 desserts and a carafe of sake. The only memorable dish was the beef tongue. Now that will be something I'll reorder again if I do come back. It's stewed in miso so it's very tender. It came in huge cubes which was a little different from my usual sliced tongues. The daikon and spinach and mushroom that came with it was all soaked with miso and oh so juicy. It's not one of their specialty dishes so one can have it at anytime. All the desserts are worth trying. We opted for the black sesame creme brulee and pear millefeuille. Yum yum yum. Japanese restaurants usually don't offer very many options for dessert (besides the usual bland green tea ice cream) but Sakagura had quite an impressive list. The sake we had were a special one, something about 12th year anniversary or 12th year something. The point is that it's very fruity and light. Good for white wine drinkers. I can't say that it'd still be on the menu though since it was "special". Oh the place wasn't hard to find at all. It's just a little more walking than just through a door like most other restaurants. Common sense is all you need to find it.

Attempting to find another tapas place I had stumbled upon in Midtown a while back, we typed in "tapas" and "Midtown" - and found Sakagura. ?Thanks fellow Yelpers - without your directions, we would never have found this place just walking around. ?Honestly, we were a little hesitant wandering into the office building and down into the basement (as there aren't a lot of signs pointing you in the right direction, we actually thought that maybe we had gone in the wrong building). ?This place is amazingly done though. ?The décor - you would not know that you were in a basement. ?In Midtown. We got here "early" (at around 6) on a Tuesday evening without reservations. ?The hostess seemed a little in shock "NO reservation?!" and seated us as long as we promised to be done by 8:15 as there was a reserved table. ?Almost every single table had a reserved sign on it in the area that we had been seated, and by the time we left at 8, the whole back area was complete full. ?If you're planning on coming here with a big group after 7, I highly recommend making a reservation. ? Dishes here are small, which is great because you get a lot of great variety. ?The waitress told us that typically people order 2-3 dishes per person for a full meal; we ended up with 4 dishes each plus dessert before we were ready to call it a night. ?Some dishes are slightly bigger than others. ?I recommend ordering a handful of things and keeping a menu on hand to order more if you're still hungry. ?We really enjoyed everything we ate here, especially the dessert: black sesame crème brule. ?It's not a cheap dessert, but it is really, really good. ? The service is really great here. ?Our waitress was amazing as was the other wait staff. ?Our table was bussed immediately after our dishes went empty, but we never felt like we were being rushed (despite having a "deadline" for having to get out!). ?Our waitress either served us or was supervising the serving from a distance. ?The one time we were accidentally served the wrong dish, she came by and took care of the mistake right away before I had time to poke and ask my hubby what he had ordered. ? I think given the location and quality of food and service, this place is worth every dime. ?For our 9 items + beer, our bill came to around $120 before tip. ?If you're looking for good Japanese and you're in the neighborhood, stop by this gem.

Favorite sake bar in US, great selection and izakaya dishes with attentive Japanese service. The food is fantastic, try the onsen tamago, a soft boiled egg with uni and ikura. The bartenders do a good job with recommendations on sake, as the list can be overwhelming with coverage across Japan. It's located in a nondescript office building. Walk through the lobby and past the guard to the basement restaurant. Quite a beautiful space.

Stepping into this place is sort of like teleporting to Tokyo. Partially because it's in the basement and partially because of the decor. The onsen tamago with uni is delicious, but in general it's a bit pricey and I've left hungry on a couple of occasions. If you're in the Grand Central area around lunch, the soba set or the bento are really good. The quality and presentation make it worth it.

4.5 stars I must have walked by this place a million times before realizing that it's within the basement of a building. I was little wearry walking down the dark stairway to get to the restaurant, but once you step inside, you're transported to what seems like a Japanese oasis... almost makes you feel like you're really in Japan. The tapas here are amazing and unique. I have ordered so many things off the menu that I cannot account for them all, but I remember that they left quite a great impression! The sake here is insane. They must house upwards towards a hundred different kinds or maybe even more. The service is superbly fluid! They bring out your tapas one at a time and are so precise... as soon as you are finished with one plate, they whisk it away and like magic your next treats are in front of you. Everything here from the decor to service is excellent. It can get a little pricey and you may leave feeling a little hungry, but it's definitely worth a trip for the overall experience and quality of food. I highly recommend this hidden treasure if you want to impress a date or group of friends. Reservations are recommended!

Everything about this place is amazing! The decor is fabulous, the servers are extremely sweet and on point, and the food is some of the best Japanese I've had. Don't be turned off by the fusion aspect of the menu, everything is fresh and wonderful. Pure, simple ingredients. I've eaten here with a small group a few times and tried a pretty large portion of the menu and everything has been terrific--they have fresh-made tofu! ?The black sesame creme brulee and earl grey ice cream are worth a trip alone.

Not easy to find but once uncovered it is a TRUE Japanese meal that you will surely enjoy! If you are looking for the typical Japanese menu then this is not for you. ? Yelp helped me find this gem, I was accompanied by my Japanese manager and two other co-workers. My manager was so impressed and excited about the menu that he ordered for us - through out the meal he kept complimenting and explaining that our meals were prepared the REAL Japanese way! ?ALL of our meals were DELICIOUS and I would certainly recommend this restaurant. ?

Love this place very much. I went to this place twice during my four days trip in NY. It's a bit hard to find the place as it located in the Basement. For lunch time. I love their soba, it's very tasty. Their sashimi is good quality as well. If you go there during lunch time, you must try their soba. There are a lot of people eating in the restaurant. ?The restaurant opened at 11:30am, and we made our reservation at 11:30 am too. I discovered that the restaurant was already full at 12pm.

Reviewers below seriously exaggerate the small size of the dishes, what do they expect from tapas?? I'm six months pregnant and I left feeling very full and content without breaking the bank. Here is what our group of 4 had: JIDORI SHIOYAKI : grilled organic free range chicken with sea salt and yuzu citrus pepper. Delicious! Moist and flavorful. One of my favorite dishes. SURUMEIKA YAKI : Grilled Japanese squid. Pretty good, light, tasty and not chewy. Good portion. EBI SHINJO : Deep fried shrimp balls covered with sliced almonds. Was okay, filling, and almonds are a nice touch. GYU MISO NIKOMI : Shredded beef back ribs stewed in miso topped with grated daikon radish. This was amazing. The meat is tender and so flavorful. A few nice bites for all of us. EBI STICK : Deep fried shrimp roll with "nori" seaweed and oba leaf served with a miso sauce. Pretty good! A nice crunch and the dipping sauce was yummy. Six pieces. We also had some edamame, standard fare and one of the specials a hot noodle soup that was delicious. The highlight of the night, as most have said, is the black sesame creme brulee. We split two and I could have scarfed done a whole one myself. Overall it was a really great dinner. We all left full and very satisfied. Bill was $40 a person including tip. I can't wait to go back!

WUT the WUT!? Is this place for real? Does it truly exist? Was it a figment of my imagination? Could it be the best sake bar in NYC? I'm thinking that answer is a "hells yea".. can I get an Amen!? I always wanted to go to Sakagura, I had heard it was the most authentic Japanese dining experience in the city... and for the first time in a while, the rumors were true. This spot is legit. From the makeshift Japanese village decor, to the 100s of bottles of sake lining the bar wall, and even to the basement location, this place reminds me of all those incredible random restaurants in Asia I've left behind. After dining on sushi across the street at Sushi Yasuda, my colleague and I figured the best way to end the night would be over a couple of bottles of sake at Sakagura. After placing our butts on the seats at the bar, we dove right in and went with some dry sake prepared in traditional Masu boxes. The sake was superb! Smooth, layered with flavors and with a hint of ginger on the nose. After a few more sips, we realized that side dishes were needed. We jumped into the deep end and ordered a traditional octopus in squid liver dish and the pork belly soup. The squid liver was an acquired taste, it was a very foie gras heavy flavor that lingered long after you finished eating it. Surprising, but delicious nonetheless. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and the accompanying broth was light and flavorful. The whole ensemble packed a punch and was visually appealing. Overall, this spot offers the best of the best in terms of traditional Japanese sake bars with a twist. The ambiance, the patrons, and the food are great. Good luck finding this spot, as it is hidden from the casual eye...but so worth it when you do!

Saka Gura is a hidden gem. Quite literally. It is located in the basement of what appears to be an office or apartment building. Only a discrete sign outdoors marks its subterranean presence. Walk in, make a left and head down the stairs to arrive at a very authentic japanese restaurant that serves unique japanese tapas and extraordinary, almost surprising desserts. The restaurant is dimly lit, mid-sized and has intimate booths that seat parties of four. The staff is very helpful and was patient as we tried to determine what to order from the wide-selection of dishes available. ?Our waitress gave us excellent Sake recommendations. We opted for the following: -Tofu Salad: By far my favorite savory dish of the evening. The tofu was so soft it verged on creamy. Coupled with the crisp greens and the citrusy carrot dressing, the outcome was refreshing and a perfect way to open the meal. -Duck with scallions and some delicious green sauce: The duck was cooked perfectly. My only qualm was the sliver of fat that didn't go down very nicely, but it's duck...it's fatty, I'm just a pansy when it comes to these things. Very good combination of the tender duck with the crunch of the scallions. -Grilled japanese eggplant with misos: The eggplant was very soft and the misos were such interesting additions to the vegetable. I love that the eggplant was grilled. It added a nice smoky element to the dish. -Beef slices with daikon: The meat was very lightly cooked and topped with a lovely mixture of daikon and a dark sauce. Beautiful presentation. -Shumai: This was the only disappointment of the meal. I was underwhelmed by the shumai which resembled more of a shrimp meatball than shumai. Perhaps because my expectations weren't met, I wasn't able to enjoy the shumai. -Buckwheat soba with shrimp: I love soba. It is so simple and almost cleansing. There was nothing extraordinary about this dish, but it hit the spot. The shrimp gave a nice punch to the ensemble. -Sesame Creme Brulee: This was an outstanding dessert. I have never seen or tasted anything like it and would have no idea to make something like this. It's nice to indulge in things you know you cannot make at home! The taste was complex and layered. It carried a faint peanut-buttery flavor and a decisive sesame undertone--so unique! I would absolutely recommend trying this dessert. -Coffee Jello: Another very interesting dessert. Although it was unusual and pleasing, I am not a fan of the texture of jello, so I mostly focused on the creme brulee! -Strawberry sorbet: This was exquisite. Very simple and refreshing with very strong strawberry flavors. Overall, this was an excellent meal featuring bold culinary choices. It ran us around $200, which is pricey but not bad to feed three at a fine dining establishment. If you're up for some non-run of the mill Japanese food, head to Saka Gura!!

Izakaya-fare rated on likability: Gyutan Yawaraka Ni: I like you, beef tongue. You made my frenemy wince in pain as he tried to stomach the concept of eating you. Your sympathetic side allowed him to discover you were delicious when he actually stomached your incredibly tender, stewed goodness. [1] Jidori Shioyaki: I think of you, neutrally, grilled chicken. You were perfectly crisp and salty but your yuzu-paste thing was a little smothering, like a clingy girlfriend. I think you should go solo; you're good enough on your own. Maguro Yamakake: ?I hate your guts, slimy mountain yam covering fresh tuna sashimi. You lingered in my mouth like a burst, slimy appendix or something foul, without being fowl. Satoimo Iridashi: I like you, fried taro, mushroom, and eggplant. You guys are team-players -- a true champ team, embodying crispy, light-hearted fun. My friend hates you, shiitake mushroom, but that just means I'll leave more room in my stomach for your battered presence. [2] Fluke Carpaccio: Whatever, fluke carpaccio. I thought you'd be delicious but you failed to impress, even though everything about you was situated towards a victory. Your plum paste and shiso flavor clashed and the roe that was randomly assigned to be your buddy didn't help you either. You are overrated on yelp, Fluke Carpaccio. Chawanmushi: I think of you neutrally, steamed egg custard. You were forgettable even though you were executed well. Sure you had a ponzu sauce, but I completely forgot you contained shrimp and chicken. I've had you better in other places. Sake Oyako Don: I strongly remember you affectionately, thick salmon sashimi lying with your roe friends upon a warm mountain of rice. You were the freshest salmon I've had on this side of the ocean. You're a bit promiscuous though, Don. Everyone wanted a piece of you and you easily fulfilled all of our desires as a last dish. [3] [1] You're like a dream come true [2] Just wanna be with you [3] It's plain to see, that you're the only one for me. Yelp Elite always make annotations like this. I decided to re-interpret annotations for the rest of yelp's non-benefit. Other hot keywords: Amazing decor, heated toilets, extensive sake list Last note I wanted to make and the reason why I chose not to give Sakagura five-stars is that the atmosphere of the restaurant felt more corporate America than relaxed, authentic izakaya.

I dream about this place sometimes. Since moving to Boston, I've made a number of trips back to New York, and it's almost become a ritual to come here for lunch from Grand Central first thing -- suitcase and baggage in tow. If a friend can't meet me there, it's almost a relief because then I can soak in the sublimity without distractions. I've done dinner here a few times, and the tapas and sake very satisfying each time. The izakaya atmosphere is in full brew then. But the real draw for me is the weekday lunch: the bar is quiet with just a few Japanese businessmen -- ?and the lunch sets, not offered later, are exquisitely done. Donburis, soba sets, and especially the jewel bako. Everything is cooked perfectly and plated with that thoughtful Japanese delicacy on top of wide leaves. The vegetable tempura is feather light and crisp. The ume rice is spiced and patted into neat cylinders. The squid is rolled with shiso leaf into little roulades of flavor. The bit of yam is soft and sweet, etc. etc. Even the obligatory miso soup is particularly rich. The service is also impeccable. Hot tea is poured alongside water. Steaming hand towels brought out at the beginning and end of the meal, with a little bamboo basket -- are luxurious touches.

This place may be hard to find, but it is worth the search! ?Amazing. ?Came to NYC for the weekend on mission to try a bunch of Izakayas. ?This was hands down our favorite. ?Everything was delicious, our two favorite: Onigiri w/ Spicy Cod Roe Onsen Tamag: ?Soft Boiled Egg with Uni

I wish I did more here so this review is very brief and topline if you will. So after my office holiday party, I met up with a friend and his coworker at Sakagura since we were looking for a drinking place situated near the 4/5/6 train haha. ?So his coworker (who deserves brownie points for creative problem solving) found this speakeasy-ish sake bar gem in the city. ?I literally walked past this place like 2 times as I was in search for some huge banner or board with the name of this place. ?Instead I should have been looking for a little sign near a ?parking garage entrance haha. ? The interior is so swanky and I loved everything from the booths to the bathrooms. ?Can't really comment on the food as I only ordered rice balls and our main purpose was to drink but what I had was presented nicely and tasty. ?My friend and his co-workers ordered dessert and who knew earl gray ice cream would taste so soothing!! Loved that. ?Sadly, as I was not in the right state of mind to know what sake we ordered, I can say that as not a huge fan of sake, I was pleasantly pleased. ?As sake has a strong taste for me, I liked how this one wasn't as a kick into your face lol. I would totally come here again just to chill and have a good time :)

It was a long day and night for me as this was the spot chosen for dinner. Taxi ride from Queens we came, and this location being downstairs was mmm. I like it. Walking in here, I thought wow; I like them Sake bar! It was a cool joint for hang out and it was not overly loud and would be a good place to have a conversation. ?Being that I already had dinner at a previous restaurant, I didn't care to order much. So the others order with what they know I would enjoy, UNI something. Here what we ordered. ONSEN TAMAGO : ?Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup ?$9. It was delicate. With maybe 2 pcs of uni, I was searching for more. The roe to me overpower the flavor of this dish. HIYAYAKKO : ?Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes ?$5.00 I have to say this was the 2nd best dish, and tasted a complete dish. All the component work together, as I love bonito flakes. MENTAIKO : ?Spicy Cod Fish Roe Imported from Japan ?$7.00 SALTY! That's really all I taste. Salt, salt, and more salt.. UZAKU : ?Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed ?$8.5 Why do they put cucumber slices for? This takes away the flavor of the eel and bland the plate up.. I think this plate was totally wrongly done. Design and sign, I would like the grilled eel to shine, my expectation. HIRAME PONZU : ?Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette ? $9.00 This is not so fresh fluke here, and the grated dikon radish tasted fresher here. I am disappointed with the sashimi plate. Don't order this! Food tasted below average for me, but I have to say their dessert was something to talk here. The flavor was good and being that I love black sesame, the dessert works for me. So maybe this is just a hangout for sake and dessert? BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?$9.00 2 bottle of sake and Sapporo was added to our ordered. ?All and all, I would come here to hang out for sake and dessert.

One of my all time favorite restaurants. I took the woman here for Valentines day. Everything we had was amazing and unique. The duck special that they had was the best duck I ever tried. It was absolutely perfect, it had a layer of fat on the top, not too much, but enough for it to melt in your mouth and taste like heaven. The fried mashed potato balls with salt were great. I dont like heavy starchy foods, but this was light and really good. Their fried chicken was very moist and delicious. The three different eggplants were the best eggplant I ever had in my life. I did not know which sauce was better, each one I tasted I said was "my favorite". The beef on the hot plate was good but I would not order it again, not too much of it although what I loved is that they used a cub of fat as "butter" for the rock. That was good. Service was good, and I liked that it was low key, the decor is really cool as well.

I love this place. If you need to go somewhere via random office building and into the basement and it's always full?!?! def worth it Umi soba was great refreshing not too heavy worth splitting with someone else so you can get other food, assorted tuna over rice with roe was great, the tuna tartar with the 2 different types of egg with cucumber is that I get all the time, and also the eel (3rd page of menu first item) was very good. The pork belly which is $5 per person is a huge fatty piece of pork belly in a soupy texture. They have reg soba there which was pretty good, the eggplant with miso was amazing sauces (one of them is a caramelized piece of heaven). The beef cooked on a hot stone wasn't really worth it. The yuzu cocktails was amazing... I would go back everyday if I could. Desserts remind me of spot where its not too sweet but good mix of black sesame, green tea, sorbet, and etc items.

Sakagura is consistently good. I can imagine the restaurant having a finely tuned kitchen akin to a kaizen toyota car factory.... never had a bad dish there. P.S. Stewed beef tongue is delicious.

I have taken several people here on many different occasions and the consensus each time is the same - Sakagura is sooooo good. The sake list is vast - really, something for everyone. The food is delicious. Try the maguro yamakake - tuna sashimi with grated mountain yams. Sakagura has an authentic Japanese menu that is consistently great. Love the atmosphere too.

If you're ever on the fence about the East 43rd Street Japanese joints, Sakagura is going to be a good-to-great bet for dinner - IF you have the luxury of eating a little for a lot. Its "secret" location isn't exactly low-profile; I'd venture to say it's even a little weird - clearly marked, but situated in a windowless corporate basement. That's fine, though, because the dining experience at large is good - beginning from the lovely, expansive dining room and its tasteful ?Japanese accents, and ending with (what else?) its excellent dessert selection. I've tried about ten of the regular menu items, and can confidently assure you that the food is solid, if only a little pricey ($6 - $20) for the minuscule portions.

Ah, 500. What to review for my 500th yelp? At first I thought I was set, had it all planned out that for my thirty-twelfth birthday, it would be Saka Gura. My hubby and I have done 2/3rds of the magic triangle on E. 43rd St. and would do the best day of the year as well as my 500th yelp at SG. The thing is though this is my 500th, SG was not all that to me and to us. There was nothing wrong with it we just prefer the other two (Soba Totto and Sushi Yasuda) more. First off, I do not think it is unique or fashionable to dine in the dungeon unless that is the point, like London's St. Martin's in the Field's Cafe In the Crypt. I felt claustrophobic and made sure to know where the points of egress were "just in case." I don't mind walking through a lobby area, such as at The Four Seasons, but not one where I am greeted by a nice but grossly underpaid security guard twiddling his thumbs. I like a little more atmosphere. Not walking down a flight of uninspired dirty stairs. And as the evening progressed the clientele became more dressed for an audition of The Jersey Shore. Who goes to nice restaurants wearing high tops, short shorts and/or hoopwear? Not I. That is the fault of the management for letting such riff raff in but I guess in this economy... But perhaps, it all comes down to the fact that I should have done a little more research when I picked SG since I could choose anywhere I wanted for this 30-12 occasion. That is not SG's fault. We are pescetarians so we were limited in what we could order. I have since learned that it is a top sake bar. I am all for sake but we drove in so... And it is not exactly a sushi joint. And I was wanting to be in a sushi way. So we made the best of it and ordered a whole mess of their small dishes, think Japanese tapas, LOL! First though we ordered a carafe of Ichinokura Sake which was presented beautifully but for the equivalent of four cups of sake was outrageously priced at $41! Whatev. Our first dish was Hiyakko, housemade Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes. It was so soft it was like a custard and a bit awkward to share since it was so mushy it was difficult to maneuver it but it was tasty. Then came the Tatami Iwashi, Dried Sardine Crackers Fried Crisp Served with A Spicy Mayonnaise Dip complete with the little fishies staring back at you when you went to eat it. I loved them but thought the accompanying sauce did not suit them well. I could eat those crackers all day! Yum. :))) My hubby then got the Uzaku, Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed and I am not a big fan of eel like him. He said it was "just alright." I liked the cucumber and seaweed though. The Maguro Tartar, Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviarwas the highlight of the evening though as it was not only super delish but more along the lines of what we had hoped to eat that night. Beautiful presentation as well (see picture). That would be well worth going back for if not for SY across the street. :) Our next to last item was the Jaga Dango, Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp. I think I will stick to Doughnut Plant for donuts in the future. Bland, doughy and not as interesting as I had hoped. The sea salt provided on the side made them more palatable though. Lastly came these giant balls of rice, Onigiri, topped with Spicy Cod Rose. Our ignorance on what to do with them befuddled us until we were able to catch someone's attention to explain we had to roll them ourselves. I mean they were big so I pretty much ate mine deconstructed. The spicy cod roe was spicy (yes!) and provided some flavor to the otherwise bland Onigiri. The service was not as attentive as I have come to expect from upper tier Japanese restaurants. And with the rather depressing basement setting and the lack of some basic dress code, I am afraid all I can offer is 3 stars. Indeed that is different from most other peoples' experiences but not every place is for every one. I do not anticipate a return visit to Saka Gura to sample their other offerings though am glad we tried it. With SY and ST right there and so many other competitive Japanese restaurants to try, Saka Gura just did not do it for us. :( And having just posted my pictures, I noticed that we were served our dishes in the order they are presented on the menu. Perhaps there is some logic in doing that of which, again, I am ignorant. Please enlighten me (you know who M!)! http://www.youtube.com/w…

We ended up going to this Sakaguru restaurant after a failed attempt at finding exotic grasshoppers to eat. Wait... do you know what I'm talking about? You've probably seen it on some TV show or Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/w…). I guess there are people in the world who will eat grasshoppers for fun! And not Bear Grylls-style, for survival. (You'll only know about Bear Grylls if you watch the show Man vs. Wild. If you don't know the reference, don't bother Googling it. It's too late, you can't get into the cool club...) So yeah... I went to this place with, in alphabetical order, because these people are all soooo... sensitive so I don't want to make them feel like I'm ranking them: #1 the greatest and bestest in the world Jenn L. (http://www.yelp.com/user…) Sandy C. (http://www.yelp.com/user…) Will C. (http://www.yelp.com/user…) Wing L. (http://www.yelp.com/user…) Veronica (Will's lovely girlfriend, a.k.a. the ball and chain) AH HA HA HA HA HA HA Ha! See what I just did there? I said I WASN'T going to rank them and then right next to Jenn's name, I put a #1 and how she's so great and.... Ah ha ha ha ha ha... You get it... you get it... I don't need to explain... Okay, okay... back to the review... So yeah... Sakaguru is nice. I mean, it's an interesting experience. I really didn't know what to expect at this place. I thought it was going to be a regular restaurant where you order something off the menu and it would be enough for 1 person. That's why I ordered like one thing off the menu. I figured, oh, okay, this thing here on the front of the menu, the imported Japanese octopus, that sounds good, I'm sure that's enough cause it probably comes with a soup and some rice or maybe a salad. Also, it was like $16.00 and in my life experience, if you order one thing that's $16.00, it's big enough to be considered an entire meal. HA! Was I wrong! No! That's not how it works here. The imported Japanese octopus was literally just a small bowl of like 4 small pieces of imported Japanese octopus. No frills, no extras, BOOM! [wait staff slams the bowl down in front of me and tells me to "Eat up, beotch"]. We're talking like 4, count them 1-2-3-4, United States American dollars per piece here!!! I think that's the only thing I ordered that night. I don't think I was paying attention to what other people were ordering, otherwise I would've noticed that everyone else ordered 3 or 4 different dishes, none of which were $16 each. L-O-L. What can I say? Me dumb... Alright, alright, prices aside, I personally don't know how I feel about the food. I really don't remember what I ate. I'm more of a meatball sub type of guy. I don't know how to enjoy the culinary masterpieces the world has to offer. On my good food/bad food meter, General Tso is way up top. That's probably why I can't get a sophisticated girlfriend. I feel like girls would like this place. Like, if I was one of those girly-guys who's all metrosexual-y and gets manicures all the time, I would be able to use big words and make orgasm faces as I shoveled this stuff into my face hole. I would exaggerate every bite and close my eyes and be all, "oh my god... my life is complete... I am ready to die... this is heaven... my balls just went back inside my body..." Okay, maybe not that last part. That last part was added for emphasis, to drive home the point that I am NOT that guy :D So anyway, thank goodness I had a $5 dollar footlong (Eat Fresh!) before I went to that place. I was really going just so that I could hang with these lovely people. They could've taken me to ANOTHER gay rubber spandex dungeon and I would've went... again. So again, it wasn't like I was hungry. Although at the time, they kept asking me if I had enough to eat and I just kept explaining I really wasn't hungry. But you know what? As I'm typing this now... I realize that they might've thought I was really cheap or something for not ordering more food. They were probably thinking, "Hey, this giant (I'm tall) guy doesn't want any more food? Is it cause it's so pricey and he's poor?" If they were thinking that... well... THEY WERE 150% CORRECT! LOL! No, I'm just kidding... I'm kidding! I'm kidding! I seriously wasn't hungry and I literally had a Spicy Italian footlong (the sandwich, not the euphemism for foreign man penis) right before we met up. So yeah, let me just make this review a little bit more clear. If you work the following jobs, you will not enjoy the food here: Sanitation Worker Plumber Lumberjack Construction Worker Gas station attendant Security guard Alright... so on top of telling you my experience about this place, now you also know my entire resume... :-\ HA! I'm just kidding... Ladies? Ladies? Where are you all going!?!?!? - - - P.S. I also had the coffee jello dessert. That was pretty good.

Sakagura, along with Sushi Yasuda and Soba Totto, all located on the same block of east 43rd street, form a holy trinity for Japanese food enthusiasts. ?I can think of no better place to be in the city than on this block. ?Sakagura though, if not the best of the three, is the most interesting because many people are likely to miss it. ?You have to enter a private building and go downstairs below street level to get to it. ?As such, it tends to be a place frequented by those in the know, and among those, mostly Japanese. ?Clearly exclusivity is auspicious in this case. I sat at the bar for lunch and was tempted by the rich selection of sake, and the sake flights they have available, but ultimately did not yield. ?I can't drink at lunchtime. ?The selection was impressive though. ? I ordered the tsukune for the appetizer. ?This consisted of 4 chicken meatballs drizzled with teriyaki sauce served over a bamboo leaf. ?These were delicious with nicely balanced flavors. ?Immediately after these were placed though, my main entree of the Kamo Namban arrived. ?Even more delicious. ?The soup came replete with generous rectangular cuts of tasty roasted pork, shiitake mushrooms, scallions, soba noodles, and a soy based broth. ?The noodles were ideal possessing great taste and separating with ease. ?The broth was lovely too. ?The vegetable additions were a bit chewy to be functional though, but the dish was otherwise solid and worth slavering over. ? For dessert I had their signature truffles which come in three different flavors. ?The black sesame with shochu flavor was decent but too evocative of alcohol to really pass for candy. ?The green tea flavor was excellent though. ? Highly, highly recommend Sakagura for Japanese food along with the two neighboring restaurants. ?Even when they are short of perfection, they are so much better than many other places.

This is the first milestone review that I was actually aware of, so I saved it for the most delicious dinner I've had in a while. ?You, Sakagura, get the coveted spot of #300. ?As I've said before on Yelp, I love izakayas and Sakagura has just made its way to the top of my list. My friend wanted to take me out for my birthday and after planning around both of our busy schedules, we finally settled on a date and reservations were made. I know that everyone talks about the "hidden" entrance, but I thought that Sakagura was plenty easy to find. ?Just look for the office building. ?They have a sign out front, in the main "lobby" and by the doorway of the stairs you go down. ?It's not that difficult people! ?Follow the signs! The walk down the stairs is a bit creepy, so thank goodness we were together already or I would have been reluctant to go on my own. ?I'm not one to venture down into the basement. ?Seriously, basements are all dark, dank and creepy. But, this is one basement I wouldn't mind entering over and over again. Imagine my surprise when I walk through the main entrance to find a beautiful, wood filled space. ?It reminded me of a small village, albeit a dimly lit village. ?Perfect for a date, I noticed. ?The long bar on the left glowed with all the bottles of back-lit sake. ?It was quite lovely. Our waitress led us to our table in the depths of the restaurant, winding past our fellow diners. ?We were seated and placed our order. ?My friend is tiny, but she can probably eat on the competitive circuit... ?At final count, 10 dishes were ordered and this didn't even include dessert. In order of what we had: Tofu Salad ?- a large cube of silky tofu on a bed of romaine lettuce topped with cucumbers, radishes and radish sprouts served with miso dressing. ?I love tofu and this salad was delicate but flavorful. ?It was a wonderful start to our meal. Uzaku - chilled, broiled eel and sliced cucumber with vinegar dressing, ?My friend's pick, so I had a piece and let her finish the rest. ?The eel was rich and the vinegar dressing paired well. Maguro Tartar - maguro tuna tartar topped with yuzu-steeped tobiko and caviar. ?Now, I love sushi, so I do enjoy most tartars, but the addition of the yuzu-steeped tobiko just made this dish all the more enjoyable. ?The pearls of tobiko the burst with yuzu flavor really enhanced this dish. Chawanmushi - steamed egg custard. ?One of my favorite comfort foods... ?This seemed like a very luxurious version. ?It was velvety smooth and had the hidden treasures of shrimp and ginko nuts near the bottom, but what I enjoyed most was the addition of the spicy grated daikon and scallions it was garnished with. Gindara - broiled cod. ?Another of my friend's picks that I reserved mainly for her. ?I tried some and although the sauce was a tiny bit sweet to me, my friend really enjoyed it. Tsukune - what izakaya trip is complete without the ordering of chicken meatballs? ?It's an izakaya standard and these were quite well prepared. ?Juicy and tasty, the way they should be! Lotus Root Stuffed Duck - this was on the specials list and was unfortunately one of two disappointing dishes. ?The lotus root is pounded into a paste, reminiscent of mochi, but not as glutinous, then stuffed with duck. ?It was okay, but the lotus root was bland and the duck was overcooked. ?There was no flavor and it was dry for duck... ?We had maybe half of this. Mentaiko Onigiri - another izakaya standard. ?A bit strange as the mentaiko was not stuffed in the rice ball, but no matter. ?These were still very good. ?I wondered if I could've ordered these grilled... Yuba Shumai - steamed pork dumplings. ?These were the other disappointing dish of the evening. ?Pork mixture wrapped with tofu skin. ?I love yuba and shumai is always a good thing, but these dumplings were offensive. ?The texture of the pork was like sawdust. ?I would've ate two of the lotus root-duck this than have any of these. ?Again, this dish was not finished. Soba - the last thing before dessert was the cold buckwheat noodles with dipping sauce. ?This were cooked perfectly. ?I couldn't have asked for a better end to our gut-stuffing meal. Since it was my birthday dinner, my friend insisted on dessert. ?We got: Black Sesame Creme Brulee - my pick. ?Delicious, creamy, rich. ?Each spoonful was like a nibble of heaven. ?Too bad dinner was so filling, because I think I might've picked up the bowl and licked it clean - hahahhaha! ?I probably had half of it and was really saddened to leave it. Green Tea Ice Cream - I didn't even bother to try this, but I'm sure this was a premium version and not one of those where you can barely taste the green tea flavor. The presentation of all the dishes was impeccable. ?As was the service. ?Even with two dishes that bombed, it completely deserves my 5 stars. I also ran out of room, so I'm forced to cut my review short... ?But, know this, I *HEART* Sakagura!

[-1 Star because service was wayyyyy off. ?I hate holiday seasons when the regular staff is gone.] I admire greatly people who know what the hell they are talking about, but who don't feel the need to remind you of that every 5 minutes. ?This leaves time to talk about other things, which of course includes more "airtime" for me. ? ? ? MeMeMeMeMe! ? Competency is critical for Japanese cuisine, and having an expert there saves ME the embarrassment of asking, when confronted by a statement from the server as: "We have fresh tako tonight." with questions like: "Are they two for 99 cents?" or "Oh, do you have lengua?" ? Hey, what do you want? ?I was raised as a SoCal kid who likes tongue... Luckily, I had such an expert on Japanese cuisine with me. ?Knowing he's modest and not one to seek attention, I'll save the laudatory praises for another review. I love the cuisine here, despite complaints people have about cost. ?Everything was fresh, deftly prepared and accompanied by just the right amount of seasoning. ?Japanese cuisine is all about subtlety, and people who complain about how little flavor their food has should probably stop eating poo and let their taste buds grow back. ?Seriously, put less salt on your food and give it a week or two. What we had (if you hate long reviews, just order the stuff marked with "*" when you take me): *ONSEN TAMAGO : Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup - $9.00. ?Duuuude, I dub this the "surf & turf" dish on account of the chicken egg and salmon roe combination. ?The uni was exquisite; truly the best I've ever had and even--dare I say it--better than Yoshi's, which was the first place I acquired a taste for uni ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/… ). ?Well, let's just say you never forget your first, but I'd highly recommend this if you're not put off by any of the various ingredients. ? IKA SHIOKARA: Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and Squid Liver Marinade - $5.50. ?There was a "pop" from the liver marinade, but it could be too pungent for inexperienced eaters--kind of like when you first eat raw fish of the female variety. ?My advice is to down a couple of shots of sake and then you and your squid will both be relaxed enough to enjoy it. *FLUKE CARPACCIO: Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil and Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf - $10.00. ?Me so in love with shiso. ?This was not outstanding, but very good. ?I will say that, like a good employee (but one who's not really necessary to the bottom line), this would be the last one I would cut if I were only to order HALF of the menu. *SATOIMO IRIDASHI: Taro Potato, Eggplant and Shiitake Mushrooms Fried in a Light Batter served Broth - $8.50. ?I'm Taiwanese and all about taro. ?This was some goood root. *JAGA DANGO: Mashed Potatoes Coated and Fried in Donut Batter - $6.00. ?The best way to describe this is to replay my stream of consciousness as I bit into it: "Hmm, there's a subtle sweetness that is definitelOMGISTHATMOCHIINTHEMIDDLE?!?" ?I'd imagine there's a Japanese version of Homer Simpson walking around in Japan somewhere, popping these babies into his mouth. ?I'd rate this a "Woo-hoo!" and a "must order." *MAGURO TARTAR: Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar - $15.00. ?What can I say? ?A good tuna preparation is hard to find. SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU: Grilled Japanese Eggplants with Three Kinds of Miso (Egg Yolk, Spinach, and Sweet Red) - $12.00. ?Eggplant is yummy, but I was starting to be full and didn't try this. *WAGIYU ISHIKAYA: Wagiyu Beef Cooked Over Hot Stone - . ?This was definitely a highlight of the meal, and I only wish I could have cooked the beef. ?However, after the last time I almost set the house on fire by trying to fry a turkey, I've learned to let the pros do it. TORI TSUKUNE: Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce - $6.00. ?The only "meh" part of the meal, probably because I don't like balls. CHAWANMUSHI: Steamed Egg Custard Served with Chicken, Shrimp and Gingko Nuts Topped with a thickened Ponzu Sauce - $9.00. ?My parents really love chawanmushi, and I'd love to be able to take them here to try this. *HOMEMADE "NIHACHI SOBA ": Cold Plain Buckwheat Noodle Served with Bonito Infused Soy Dipping Sauce - $12.00. ?Great, solid soba that had a significant bounce--just like your GF's fake boobs. ?I would order this at the beginning of the meal next time so I'm still hungry enough to eat it. ?ALL OF IT. INANIWA" UDON NOODLE from AKITA: Hot broth with Spinach - $11.00. ?I'm not normally a fan of udon, but this was a thinner version and very special. We didn't have the dessert here as we moved on to venue 2, Cha-An. As you will gleam from other reviews, this is a serious date place; out of the way and no cell phone reception. ?If you make it to date 4+, it's a good bet you'll end up taking me here.

As my boy Flavor Flav would say..."Wow, wow, WOOOOOOW"!! ?This is truly a Japanese experience. ?The food here was ABSOLUTELY delicious. ?This was a fantastic surprise which we owe to Yelp. ?There is NO WAY IN HELL that we would have ever found this place without the help of our trusted and true Yelp. When you first come upon the address you become a little leery, "is there a restaurant here"? ?You walk into the lobby of some sort of educational facility, there's a guard sitting there you ask, "restaurant", he says "downstairs", you begin to head down. ?The whole time we are walking down we are going "ok, this is strange". ?But once you get there you are transported to Tokyo. ?Just about everyone who works here is Japanese expect for a couple of bus boys and I would say 85% of the people eating there were Japanese! ?A very GOOD SIGN. The food here is OUTSTANDING, we were absolutely blown away by two dishes in particular the duck appetizer and the egg plant tasting menu dish. ?All our dishes we enjoyed very much and they have a huge sake selection. ?I could go on and on but to sum it all up!! ?The food, the drink, the service...OUTSTANDING. ?We will most definitely be coming back to Sakagura next time we are in Manhattan!

What's with restaurants these days? The quality does not justify the pricing and Sakagura is definitely one of them. The food is typical izakaya style, plated pretty. Attentive plating = jump in price. Sure it's authentic.... only because they offer more than bento box dinners with a side of California rolls. I've been here three times and all three times the food was mediocre with sky high bills. (avg $800 for 4-5 ppl dinner and drinks. no tax or tip) Yes they offer 200+ variations of sake but even as a full blown Japanese, I was confused as shit. I only knew 30% of the sake menu, if that. My heavy drinker friend from Japan was volunteered to order drinks and even he was stuck on stupid. We ended up asking the server for his recommendation and he brought one of the most expensive sakes.... it was fruity. What a disappointment. The second round, we ordered the recommended sakes written next to the dishes on the menu. But that didn't do it for us either. So for the third round and on, we stuck to what we were familiar with... maybe I'm too picky but Sakagura is known for its sake selection. And the website is all about the 200+ varieties of sake. If that's what they market, I expect my experience to be exceptional and unfortunately it wasn't. I went back a second and third time to triple check if our particular server was new or the chef wasn't on his game and/or other factors that contributes to unsatisfactory dining experiences but all three times practically mirrored my first. Unremarkable food, high bill, below average sake experience. Needless to say, this is one place I will never return to. Even if someone else is paying for my dinner... wait, for free food maybe I'll go. Maybe. p.s. since i ranted like a raging sake expert (which i'm definitely not. my full japanese parents are border line alchoholics. sake know-how was naturally instilled) i'll end this with a few tips. sake is just like wine. personal preference, temp, various types and bodies are factored into the experience so i'm not going to make any recommendations. what i can say with 110% confidence is hot house sake is equivalent to carlos rossi. that 10 dollar a jug cooking wine? if you've never tried it consider yourselves lucky. not to mention how much i envy you for not ever being a broke as a joke alkie like me. but i digress. avoid the hot house sake as your main drink unless massive hangovers and yacking like crazy is your thing. the end. jeez this is long

I was taken here for my birthday and I could not have asked for better food or dining experience. ?You will have to forgive me, my birthday was over a month ago, and I'm old. ?My memory is steadily declining as is expected with the aging process. ? We ordered the sashimi 5 piece sampler, which was a special of the night. ?Every piece of fish was thick, fresh, and screaming to be devoured. ?I'm not a fan of uni, but I happily licked a rock on the bottom of the ocean floor. And let me tell you, it tasted damn good. ?That clearly is a sign of good fresh fish, because Jason C. makes me eat uni and it never tastes like that. ? We next had a seared scallop/s with an egg yolk vinaigrette. ?I believe that was a special for the night as well. ?The vinaigrette was a little to strong for my liking and probably a little to cholesterol laden. ?I'd pass pass on it next time. ? If you are going to get anything get the fluke carpaccio and the other fluke dish, Hirame Ponzu. ?These two dishes are out of this world good. ?I could literally eat plate after palate of olive oil joy and citrus bliss. ?I would go back just for these two plates. Of course I had to get the maguro tartar because I love maguro and caviar. ?Only thing I love more than caviar is Champagne and gold. ?This clearly was a given, a delicious given. ?I would get this again as well. ? The fried shrimp balls covered in almonds didn't hit my spot. ?Boo. ?They tasted very dry and I would have preferred them in some sort of dipping sauce. ? We ordered more, however my memory fails. ?Every raw fish dish was fresh and the execution of flavors is on point, as well as the presentation. ?Not only did I receive dessert for my birthday, but was get sung to and had a nice Polaroid photo to take home with me. ? I would suggest going with a large group so you can sample as many dishes as possible from the vast selection of small plates. ? On a final note, the bathrooms are like little tikis with the coolest toilets on the planet. ?Not only was my bum warm upon sitting, but I was able to play with all the settings. ?I had my bum cleaned, my cooter cleaned, and I'm pretty sure everything dried. ?That is some high tech shit.

43rd between 2nd and 3rd has become my favorite block. Sakagura, Soba Totto, Sushi Yasuda make a holy trinity of amazing Japanese restaurants, brought to you by the letter S. Sakagura is a lovely, cavernous restaurant, and it quite literally feels like a cave once you start spelunking down the series of stairs underground and losing your AT&T reception on the way. ?My brother and I made last minute reservations on a Monday, and they had a 7:15 pm availability at the bar. ?We arrived ravenous and left with satiated appetites, full but comfortably so, ordering: HIYAYAKKO : ?Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes ?$5.00 (solid, nothing extraordinary) IKA SHIOKARA : ?Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade ?$5.00 (warning: this was good but very salty) ONSEN TAMAGO : ?Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup ?$9.00 (the waiter recommended we each get one, but the uni was decent enough of a serving to be shared) SEAWEED SALAD : ?Assortment of Seaweed Topped with a choice of Citrus Vinaigarette OR Sesame ?$8.00 (the sesame dressing is incredible) SANMA ONIGIRI : ?Cooked Rice Balls with Shiitake Mushroom, Pickled Radish and Mountain Vegetables Wrapped with a Whole Baked Pike Mackerel [3pcs] ?$10.00 (this was wonderful-crispy rice balls wrapped in crispy mackerel) UNI SOBA $22 (honestly loved this more than the Uni Soba at Soba Totto and Soba Ya- the broth sets it apart from the rest) SESAME CR?ME BRULEE $9 (solid, nothing extraordinary) Like most Izakaya places, Sakagura is a great place to try a little bit of everything, and I will definitely come back to work my drunken way through the extensive sake menu.

Such refined food! I feel.. blissful. It's in the basement of a building, although if you keep a look out you'll find the large sign that will direct you to this wonderous place. The interior of the restaurant is homey with bamboo-like furniture, mellow yellow lighting, and rows of sake for the taking. Not pretentious at all considering the plentiful sashimi, sea urchin, cooked seafood, raw octopus, bright eggplant, crisply fried tofu that's here to please you. Might I add that the restroom has a heated toilet seat to toast your bottom? The Izakaya dishes are perfect for those that want a little taste of everything, for a dance of flavors that together or separately tickle your fancy. The night's dinner order included: -onsen tamago: a soft boiled egg with gooey, flowing egg yolk with sea urchin and salmon roe in a cold, refreshing broth http://www.yelp.com/biz_… -tofu salad: shredded bright green lettuce and sliced tomato topped with cold, soft tofu and finely chopped salted pickle (an amazing contrast of soft tofu and crunchy pickle!); served with a side of creamy miso dressing http://www.yelp.com/biz_… -fluke sashimi: served with lemon and a vinaigrette dressing for a slight acidic taste http://www.yelp.com/biz_… -gindara yuan yaki: grilled cod fish enfused with a sweet miso based soy sauce and accompanied by little bits of sliced mushroom; the fish was thoroughly marinated and the sweet miso soy sauce was integrated fully with the flesh http://www.yelp.com/biz_… -sanshoku nasu dengaku: six pieces of grilled japanese eggplant, two pieces in each of three kinds of miso , the eggyolk (?), spinach, and sweet red sauce. I didn't taste those distinct flavors, but eat and savor each piece of eggplant slowly and you'll find that the miso sauces are distinct in thickness, creaminess, saltiness, and sweetness. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I absolutely loved it at sakagura.

We are eating once again. We as in Jimmy C, Jenn L, Wing L, Will C and his girlfriend. I mean what is there better to do than eat 24/7? Well naps are good too. So we arrived in front of this office building, got to the security desk and he looked at us, but no questions were asked and we proceeded towards the door way. The doorway led us down to the basement of this building and upon opening the door we felt like we were in a whole different world. It's something like A Wrinkle In Time, except we are not on a quest to look for Mr. Murry, but on a quest to feed our stomachs. We were seated rather quickly and we all looked at the menus. I don't know was it just me or did others get a little crossed eye from looking at this menu. There were so many things to choose from, but they were not categorized in any way to let us know what we were looking at. All the foods were very small portion, which seems like majority of the menu is made up of appetizers. There were some normal size portion foods, but we didn't really know which ones they were. With the 6 of us we ordered what seem like a feast, but it's a very small portion feast. ONSEN TOMAGO - a soft boiled egg with sea urchin and salmon roe in cold soup. This was pretty interesting because the sea urchin was squishy in this cold broth. UZAKU - grilled eel with vinaigrette served with thin cucumber slices and wakame seaweed. This dish was very flavorful, which I liked a lot. JAGA DANGO - Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp. This consisted of 4 fried dough's, but it was nothing too special about this particular dish. FLUKE CARPACCIO - Thin Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf. The fluke was thinly sliced and was very fresh. CHAWANMUSHI - Steamed Egg Custard Served with Chicken, Shrimp and Gingko Nuts Topped with a thickened Ponzu Sauce. I ordered this dish because the name was just so darn cute. This was pretty good, but the egg custard reminds me of a Chinese dish at home. KAISEN KIM-CHEE DON - Assorted Chopped Sashimi Mixed with Kimchee over rice. This dish was normal portion size and it was really good and not spicy at all. On the special menu, which I can't find the names on-line that we had ordered: Scallop with mango sauce - if you guessed if I ordered this dish then you guessed correctly. I love scallop and mango, so this was a must get for me. The scallop was fresh and the mango sauce only had a hint of mango flavor, so this dish was okay. Imported octopus, which had a springy texture to it. It was very fresh and it was pretty good. Steak with a hot stone, which I have seen on some travel shows and always wanted my very own hot stone to cook with. But never seen one in person until that night. Wing broke his stone because it stopped working for him, while he was cooking his steak on it. Luckily for Will's stone that was still functioning. This dish was interesting because of the stone, but the steak was just okay. There were some other things on the special menu we had ordered, but I don't recall the names, but I have pictures =) There were some interesting dessert selections at this restaurant, so we had to try some. CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with Vanilla Ice Cream & Raspberry Sauce, which the soufflé was very soft and fluffy. I like the soufflé a lot and the ice cream was just ice cream. BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream - my other weakness aside from mango. I really really like black sesame! So I definitely ordered this dessert. This dessert was incredibly delicious! ? ? ? PEAR MILLEFEUILLE with Earl Gray Ice Cream, this dessert was pretty good too. The pear went really well with the flakey cookie and the earl gray ice cream was really good. COFFEE JELL-O, which is Coffee Gelatin Dessert with Vanilla Ice Cream. This dessert was okay. I'm not really a fan of coffee. But this dessert looked really cute because the ice cream looked like a little turnip. Sea Salt Chocolate Sorbet, which was okay as well. I didn't find this dessert to be too special since I've had sea salt sorbet before. Again all the dishes were quite small resembling appetizer-like dishes and they were somewhat on the pricey side. But I think it's a pretty neat place to check out because of where it is located, the unique foods here and of course the bathroom. How can I not include this in my review. Well the bathrooms were interesting because they were kind of hidden next to the wall. Also, the toilet that has a controller attached to the wall for various cleaning and drying activities...Japanese people, they are so clever and witty! And honestly, I was afraid I did not know how to flush the toilet, but luckily there was a huge arrow with the word "FLUSH" indicating which button is to flush. And our quest to feed our stomachs concludes here, until next time.

What a neat place! ?Thank you, Yelp friends. ? I took a personal day on a Friday and met up with a few former colleagues for lunch. Location: Midtown East area. Sakagura is located in an office building. ?Once you walk into the office building, walk past the Security Guard, and he'll direct you downstairs into the basement. Food: Awesome! I ordered the Kaisen Don (assorted sliced Sashimi on top of sushi rice with cold homemade soba noodles (can also get the soba noodles hot as well). ?Both the sashimi & soba noodles were super fresh. For dessert, I ordered their famous Black Sesame Creme Brulee with Black Sesame Ice Cream. ?It lives up to its hype. ?If there is nothing else you get there, you MUST GET the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. ?You will NOT regret it!

Recommended for: ?Sake lovers, japanese cuisine, lunch/dinner with friends/family, a date. Food 5, Service 5, Ambiance 5. I'm picky about food, service, ambiance, the whole 9, even more so, about my sake, knowing this, my friends organized an outing to this place (though WHY on a sunday night... I have work the next day)... Walk into an unassuming office building, down a flight of stairs, passed the boiler room (feeling sketchy coming on...) and you arrive at this oasis! ?Decorated in light woods and earth tones, it is a pleasant visual experience. ?Led to the back a table for 6 (later 7) was set up for us. ?They have 3 menus, sake, special tasting menu (of sake) and food. ?I did not realize this for about, oh 3 minutes... yes, Sean is slow. ?I ask around the table if people want dry or sweet, I like dry, and no sooner did we speak our waiter arrives. ?I love good service, and I will say our waiter was exceptional! ?We started speaking in english, then I thought this is stupid, I'm going to speak in Japanese... we chit chat over sake and soon after he brings two bottles - gotta make everyone happy right? ?Glasses are as beautiful as the sake tasted *weeping* We ordered close to oh, 12 dishes (see Jade and Julie photo shoot). ?Definitely recommend the flying fish carpaccio, tamago yaki, and my personal fav, the Wagiyu Ishikaya... again, Sean is all about FUN! ?Yes, here our waiter first cooked this deliciously fatty tender oh so mouth water mooo; it was so good, I had to get it again, and this time I cooked :) Desserts were also delightful. ?While you may be underground you don't feel it. ?High ceilings, earth stones, light walls and natural woods and plants make you feel like your in suburban japan - I truly felt at peace. The only gripe I have is the discrimination at the bathroom. ?There are guys and girls, both are immaculate but its not fair that the girls get the japanese TOILET!!!! ?WTF, I want to have a heated seat, buttons to wash, etc... :( ? ?But seriously, its not a gripe, I just wanted to use it too... though the girls did let me go in and see the room :) Amazing service, sake (we had 3 big bottles) , food (fresh, tasty and delicious), atmosphere, and service, I will definitely be back again... though be wary, if you are eating with me, your bill just might go close to the 4-digit range!

I went here with some friends.. The menu is very different, there are no sushi or rolls and not such a great selection of sashimi either. I didn't recognize more than half of the menu, so I asked the waiter which are the most popular dishes and got them. The food was good, you just have to be careful with what you order to be on you taste. The service is ok.

The location in the basement of an office building was interesting. ?You'd never know what the interior was liked based purely on the exterior and that's usually a bonus for me. ?It was much bigger than I expected with a back room that would be good for larger parties. ? We started with flights of sake based on Jen D.'s recommendation (thanks, yo) and that put us in a good mood. ?We tried a number of things but my favorites were the cube steak, fried monkfish and liver, fluke sashimi with roe and shiso and black sesame creme brulee. ? Service was fine but it just wasn't the same without the SF hoodlums I usually end up at izakayas with. ?When did I get so sentimental (don't answer that, chubi)?

I took my boyfriend to Bohemian on his birthday, so he took me here on mine. Hidden Japanese spots with fancy Japanese toilets appears to be the random theme.. hmmm Atmosphere and food here are completely different from Bohemian though, so no real comparison. This cute izakaya-type place is tucked away in the basement level of a random midtown office building, which is neat. Food was undoubtedly good and filling. Of the items we ordered, these are the ones I enjoyed: - Kamo roast (chilled roasted duck slices wrapped around scallion)- very tasty, especially if you love duck - Tori karaage (deep fried chicken chunks)- deep fried chicken, what's not to love - Gyu miso nikomi (stewed beef back ribs)- very tender meat, yum - Onigiri (rice balls- we ordered it with takana leaves and salmon roe)- originally thought this would just be filler for our meal, but I ended up enjoying it a lot, especially the takana leaves - Buta kakuni (stewed diced pork)- tender, large fatty chunk mmm Items that you might want to pass on: - Jaga dango (mashed potatoes fried in sweet donut batter)- sounds like it would be good, but sub par in reality; the fried part kinda overwhelms the tasteless potatoes - Chawanmushi- I usually love steamed egg, and this one was good, just not great - Homemade nihachi soba (soba on a bed of ice, served with dipping sauce)- definitely want to pass on this, unless you love soba; it just felt very plain to me I didn't really want any more alcohol, so we passed on the sake, even though the sake selection is very extensive. The downside was that the service was very iffy. Our reservation was at 9:30, but we were seated closer to 10pm even though the restaurant didn't seem too busy. Also, after we ordered, we asked the waiter if this was enough food for two, and he said something like "EH.. maybe..." but it was DEFINITELY enough. The boyfriend and I were stuffed by the end and had to pass on dessert, unfortunately. And when we wanted to take some food to go, there seemed to be an issue with that.. so odd. Food is served quickly though. I went to the bathroom after placing our order, and food was already on the table after I got back from only playing with the toilet briefly, haha.

As my list of Sakagura favorites grows, I feel that I must rework my review. ?What is on this list? ?Please, to read: In Tokyo, I had a dish called Oyako Don, and try as I did, I could not find anything like it at "authentic" Japanese restaurants here. ?Most places just fry a chicken cutlet , throw it on a bed of rice and crack an egg over it. ?Horror. ?My search was becoming desperate. Sakagura prepares Oyako Don exactly the way I had it in Tokyo: tender chunks of organic chicken with a tasty mix of onions and egg over rice. ?That was my introduction to Saka. ?A couple of luncheons later, a friend turned me on to Sake Ikura Don, salmon slices with salmon roe, steeped in sake, over rice, Tori Tsukune, chicken meatballs, and then today, the vegetable tempura, which was unlike any other tempura I've ever had before: fresh vegetables, lightly breaded, not too greasy. ?I have stuck to my first two standards for a very long time with only one or two meanderings, but today, I tried the Kamo Nanban Soba, noodles (they are known for their homemade noodles) with slices of roast duck in a hot broth. ?The broth was not salty and instead, very smooth and comforting. ? For dessert, I love the pear millefuille, the black sesame creme brule, and the chocolate "lava" cake with raspberry sauce. ?Delicious! ?A new dessert item has been added recently, which I sampled today, a buckwheat "Mochi" filled with azuki, red beans. ?To drink, I had a new item, buckwheat beer. ?It is worth mentioning that this beer is touted as a great source of protein and vitamin B12, not to mention, very low in calories. ?You may want to search for this item in your favorite Asian market. ?I know I will. ? The portions are very much to my satisfaction, and can sometimes be too much to finish! ?The dessert menu is excellent, and made in typical Japanese style: with care, almost to perfection. ?The sake selection is also excellent, and the waitstaff is very knowledgeable about their wares. ?The owner also owns Decibel, so they have to be. ?The staff are very nice, patient, courteous, and don't have an attitude even though they know they can fill their restaurant to capacity every day. ?I used to be able to just walk in with my crew, but as of late, I've had to make reservations. ?Lunch prices are reasonable. I had dinner there only once so far, and this is where the meal gets pricey. ?Still very much worth it, though. ?Dinner there unwittingly put me on a lay away plan (not the restaurants) that took me approximately 5 months to pay off. ?However, I don't regret it one bit. ?I was with amazing company, and the food and sake was equally stellar. ?Wouldn't you rather spend your money on great food, great times and getting very elegantly liquored-up than buying some status symbol that you can carry around to make others think you are hot shit? ?I would.

I felt very lucky to get seated here last Friday night. I knew after reading the reviews that if I hadn't called a week in advance to book a table for 2, there was no way we were getting one. Thankfully we scored at least some seating by 1. sitting at the bar, and 2. arriving close to 7:00. The food was fantastic. I had no less than three dishes, all of which were very good or great. I'm not a fish-eater, so I'm sure that I missed out on the restaurant's main offerings. But if you prefer food with feet, here's my take: - The Gyu Mios Nikomi (shredded beef back ribs in a miso broth). Tender and flavorful meat, with broth you can drink afterwards! - Some filet medallion dish that is served with a hot rock and ponzu sauce. It was a special, so I can't find it on the regular menu, but $20 for the small plate is seems like a lot until you taste the meat. It's incredibly high quality. - Some noodle soup with minced chicken on top. It's not on their online menu but it was pretty good. I would probably stick to the beef plates though. Good service and we enjoyed a nice leisurely dinner. Sitting at the bar doesn't make for really easy conversation (I felt like I had to keep my body tilted at this weird angle) but it's worth it to be able to eat here.

This is a unique restaurant which gave me an unexpected taste of Japanese cuisine here in New York. I don't think even after reading the reviews and getting the recommendations AND seeing the menu I was really prepared for what I was about to encounter. First, their lunch menu is VERY reasonably priced, especially their daily special soba set at $11.50 for a limited amount of sets ... but even so most of their food is very reasonably priced and they give you a lot of food as opposed to most of Manhattan where you end up paying a lot for a little. I can't lie, I was totally expecting ... sushi perhaps? but the sashimi pieces that came with my meal and even on the donburi bowl were tiny TINY pieces. Yes this was the Manhattan sized meal I was expecting ... but only for the sashimi. The sashimi was nevertheless good but I was disappointed to find that basically there was not even much nigiri or any other type sushi menu .... however, their soba ... wow. I was never even a fan of soba, I got their tasting course for lunch and the steak ... OUT OF THIS WORLD. hello, unexpected, undecorated slab of juicy tender beef ... little did I know. But overall, I have to say this was probably one of the best Japanese food experiences I've had simply because it was *so* different and quite amazing at that. The whole meal after all the combo and tasting courses came out to be around $50 for two. Lets try to find THAT in NYC ... good luck! I highly recommend their hot and cold soba sets, highly recommend their tasting menu and their beef is amazing. Sashimi not so much ... great place for lunch in the city!

What can be said that hasn't been said already about this place??? =) My wife and I strolled through 1/4 of Manhattan to find this place. ?The directions are not clear, and it is in the bottom of a very generic office building. ? (of course we saw this on No Reservations w/A.Bourdain). We walked down a nondescript stairway, and was introduced to a very ornate floor and entrance for Sakagura. ? Lots of pretty wood, and decorations. ? We were greeted to a very spoiled, entitled chinese girl (who lacked perspective) complaining to the hostess, that it was the HOSTESS' responsibility to tell this girl, when her friend arrives at the restaurant so keep their reservation. REALLY? ?You want the hostess to comb through the 30 plus people sitting down and ask "Are you Christy Chan's friend? ?I serve her every need, eventhough she doesn't work here". ? ? I literally LAUGHED at the entitled girl, because of her inane request. Anyhow, happily, we were seated BEFORE the spoiled girl and smiled all the way to our table(and w/out a reservation). IF people don't know, Sakagura get's all of their sushi daily from the Tsukigi fish market in Japan. ? We ordered their sashimi sampler and it was AWESOME. ? Super fresh hamachi, toro, and shiro maguro. ? It's similar to the difference between fresh made to order tortillas and tortillas that have been sitting around. ? The fish just melts in your mouth like butter. When my wife and I experience really good food, it's more of an emotive experience for us. ? Really good food tells a story, and you can really understand the nuances of the culture and the food when it's high quality. ? The freshest fish like this, gives you a perspective of how necessary it is to eat food from the source and avoid processed food. We ordered shrimp infused rice to eat alongside the sashimi. Very subtle but distinct flavor, that just takes you to another place. THE DESSERTS at Sakagura were outrageous. We ordered a sesame seed creme brulee, that knocked our socks off. Normally creme brulee is very sugary, and quite overpowering in sweetness for my tastes, because of the camerlized crust. The crust from this creme brulee was moderately sweet, subtle, and totally complemented the custard. ? Again, strong, w/out pounding your chest. ? We loved it, and hated why there was nothing like this in California. We also had a coffee infused ice cream that has the essence of cafe, in every concentrated bite. ? Sakagura is a total flavor journey. ? If you can cleanse your palate, of the sugary, shiney, coming around the mountain theme rolls that you think is sushi, you will experience REAL JAPANESE FOOD, that touches your soul. Just try and keep track of your friends in the waiting line, and not blame the hostess for your iniquities =)

No matter how many white-bread friends of yours come up to you and say, "I went to this awesome place last week, Saragaku or something?"... No matter how many writeups it gets in the mainstream, or how many Yelp reviews it accrues... There will ALWAYS be something cool about entering a barely marked, slightly scuffed building lobby and going down a dirty stairway into the den of potential high-class iniquity that is Sakagura. Unlike many an obscure entrance (PDT's phone booth, the Burger Joint's orange curtain, La Esquina's kitchen odyssey, etc.), Sakagura's registers as more than a mere gimmick, since the restaurant itself has a furtive vibe that justifies the discreet entrance. It's of a piece with the establishment in a way that renders novelty obsolete. But what good is a killer opening salvo without the food to back it up? Sakagura cannot provide the answer to that question, at least not for me: it happens to be the place (along with Sushi Yasuda across the street) that jump-kicked my keen enjoyment of Japanese cuisine into full-blown obsession. Consider this: The onsen tamago, or "hot springs egg", is a common enough dish at hot springs in Japan -- an egg is simmered in a dashi broth at hot-springs-water temps, where it acquires a kind of soft-boiled/poached sheen. But it's virtually nonexistent on NYC menus, so for Sakagura to have it at all is a wonder. For them to up the ante by adding a tongue of uni and spoonfuls of salmon roe is brilliance: the subtle backdrop of the dashi broth is sharpened by the brine of the roe, the sea breeze of the urchin, all in service of this gorgeously heat-touched egg whose yolk bleeds into the dashi in wisps and whorls. The sanshoku nasu dengaku is three thin slices of eggplant, each topped with a different dollop of miso-based sauce. Very elegantly plated, very pure, very simple. You might think almost too simple, but then you take a bite of that perfectly grilled eggplant, accented by the yolk, or the spinach, or the sweet red sauce, and you're reminded once again that Japanese cooking technique need not take a backseat to the French, or anyone else. How about the buta kakuni, i.e., braised pork belly? Refinement is dropped here in favor of sheer Pig, the meat falling apart in a way that still frustrates my chopstick skills even after all these years. Sweet and salty and juicy and fatty, Sakagura's version is my gold standard not only of that particular luscious dish, but of all pork belly preps, period. Shall I go on? A recent hotate special, a scored, barely cooked scallop, had one of the most refined mayonnaise sauces I've ever tasted. Sliced of lightly fried whitefish sounds like a mistake -- the cold side of the menu? -- but isn't at all once it's dressed with a sweet vinegar marinade and pickled daikon. Hirame ponzu, or thinly sliced fluke sashimi in a citrus-soy sauce, is fanned out on the place like a glistening sunburst, with grated daikon for once imbued with umami, somehow. All are plated like miniature works of art, the details sweated out relentlessly into a Zenlike rarefaction. There are, as always, imperfections. The miso soup is oddly smoky. ?A grilled tilefish proves slightly dry. Tori karaage (fried chicken) errs with too much crust. In fact, I stand by my assessment in an earlier Yelp, that Aburiya Kinnosuke has the more consistent menu. And sure, you can bet that I'll be in full-on rhapsodic mode whenever I get around to revisiting Zenkichi for a proper review. But in the decade that has passed since I first descended that dank staircase, as increasingly authentic izakayas and the like have popped up throughout the city, I have still not found a Japanese small-plates spot that is unequivocally a more complete, transporting experience. A seemingly unrelated quote from Salon: "Johnny Depp is as close to being a '30s-style movie star as we've got these days... [offering] a peculiar mix of star quality laced with pathos: Even as he flashes that instant charmer of a smile, there's also something gaunt and haunted about him, as if he were living his life in reverse, as if he already knows how it's all going to end." There's something about Sakagura's darkly sleek lines, its handsomely understated bar, its cozy booths that recalls much the same feeling -- the sense that its walls have witnessed things much beyond its decade and a half of actual existence, yet will remain forever mute about it. And just as Depp successfully resisted the pretty-boy stereotype pushed upon him early in his career, Sakagura will always transcend any attempt to pigeonhole it as simply an exotic, romantic hideaway. Sakagura ranks with Peter Luger, with Katz's, with Per Se as an exemplar of its class, an experience that simply cannot be missed if you have the time and means to visit it. Man, I didn't even mention the sake. Probability of return within 1 year: 90%

Why doesn't Chicago have anything like this??? Oh Sakagura, please come to the windy city. ?I love you! ? What an experience!! ?First of all, the restaurant is hidden in an office building. ?You walk in, go down a scary stair well, and then enter a zen like relaxing restaurant with flowing water, bamboo, candles and beauty everywhere. ?This is the place for authentic Japanese cuisine and fantastic sake. ?The service was amazing with friendly servers, unrushed so you can fully enjoy your experience. ? We started with the Junmai Dai Gingo Sake (highest grade sake), smooth, dry and hits you about 15 minutes later. ?Freaking fantastic. My BF ordered for the table... we had the following delights: Fluke Carpaccio - buttery, fresh and melts in your mouth. Raw squid with squid liver marinade Seaweed salad with four varieties of seaweed - amazing and fresh! Egg with benito flakes and cod Chicken ball with sweet teriyaki - great hot dish! ?Falls apart in your mouth! Eggplant broiled three ways with egg yolk, miso and spinach. Ishikaya (cooked on hot stone) waygu beef (cut in thin slices) - best piece of moo I've ever had. Udon with pickled plum and seaweed. Tuna sashimi with grated mountain yam. Filet minon with horseradish sauce - I don't recommend it. ?It's kind of tough. Homemade tofu fritter in traditional broth - second favorite dish. Dessert: Chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream, Red bean and chestnut ice cream with mochi and my two favorites: black sesame creme brulee and homemade truffles (the green tea truffle is out of this world). After the decadent dinner, my BF made me go into the ladies room. After ?all the sake I had, I was so excited to see the bidet!! ?Fantastic!

Wall o' sake? ?Non-sushi roll Japanese food?! ?My cup runneth over! No, seriously. ?You know how you go to those fancy restaurants (read: Del Frisco's) and they hand you this giant tome of a wine menu - and your head spins because you don't know where to start? ?Yeah. ?This place is pretty much the same, except it's sake instead of wine. ?How can you go wrong with a veritable cornucopia of sake varieties? ?Plus, they offer service in a masu (the traditional Japanese sake box on a platter, with the sake poured so that it overflows, signifying good luck). Okay, now the food. ?I took an old coworker who was in town from India here a couple nights ago, and we totally chowed down on the tapas-like grub here. ?Highlights: deep fried chicken chunks (lightly seasoned, very crispy, but the chicken is still tender and moist), fried shrimp balls covered in almond slivers (hello, fried shrimp balls - need I say anything more?), and definitely, definitely save room for Sakagura's truffles. ?I'm especially partial to the black sesame ones - black sesame covered with white chocolate and a hint of rum. ?Mmmm. ?Totally devilish and decadent. Both times I've been here, the service has been impeccable. ?Although I had reservations for us, the hostesses had us wait a few minutes - I assume this was to ensure quality service in the dining area because there were numerous open tables when we were seated. ?Plopping ourselves down at the bar, we got to see the various drinks being poured, and there was always a wait staff ready to handle our next order. Let me repeat: wall o' sake. ?Delicious small plates of food. ?Great service. ?Classy, chic decor. ?Definitely worth checking out - more than once.

I went to Sakagura for lunch on a weekday with Maria M and Sean K. I don't leave the village much, so it was definitely a little weird to be surrounded by all these corporate types wearing suits and ties... but I digress. Sakagura is pretty hard to find if you don't know where it is: it's hidden in the basement of an office building, with just a little sign telling you it's there. But apparently it does not need any more publicity, since the place was packed when we got there. Thankfully, we had a reservation and were seated promptly. The restaurant is actually very large, with a very large and impressive bar along one of the walls. They have a bunch of lunch specials, and I ordered the chirashi, which came with cold soba noodles. It was very tasty, though I think I've had better chirashi before. Still... very good. And their desserts are not to be missed: as I remember, I got the black sesame creme brulee, and it was just amazing... definitely worth the 6 or 7 bucks that I paid for it. So... good food, and nice ambiance, but given the location (Midtown East!!), you probably won't see me there too often.

what a cute underground joint. we had a choice to sit at the table but opted for the bar instead, it was a more fun atmosphere especially with the different sake bottles in the back. our waiter was super friendly and helpful. we ordered the roasted duck, black cod, deep fried pork, Agedashi Tofu and topped it off with the black sesame creme brulee. i'm not a big sake fan but how can i not drink sake here, we shared a carafe. my friend has been to the sake tastings they hold here and said it's good. they hold it the back room and have around 10-15 sakes to try and they bring out some nibbles throughout. i would come back again to try out the other dishes!

This place is really wonderful. ?I've been here twice, most recently took my mom here and she loved it. Highlights were the tuna tartare, the eel, and the duck wrapped scallion (which I ordered based off other Yelp reviews -- was not let down). ?I would get these again without hesitation. ?The beef tongue was also very good but a tad salty. ?Grilled squid was nice, but not as good compared to other dishes. ? Dishes I would skip are the soy marinated cod, eggplant, and chicken meatballs. ?For the cod and meatballs, I feel like there are places that do them better. ?The cod was also oddly salty and not a dish that is really very unique. ?You can get it elsewhere, so I would skip it unless you are really craving cod. ?Chicken meatballs were somewhat dry and not memorable. ? I'm a big fan of ?sesame based desserts, so I was excited to try their sesame creme brulee with sesame ice cream. ?The creme brulee part was good, but I was a little disappointed that the ice cream tasted just like vanilla ice cream, because it only had streaks of black sesame. ?I did, however, enjoy the earl grey and green tea ice creams on my second visit. ?Nice light way to end the meal. ? I enjoyed this experience better than Aburiya Kinnosuke for some reason. ?I can't put my finger on it, maybe I ordered the wrong things at Aburiya. ?I will be coming back to Sakagura. ?Its proximity to Grand Central is a nice plus too, and I like that you can sample different things here, have a light dinner, and walk away full but not stuffed.

I haven't tried every sake bar in the city, but I'm willing to agree with the reviewers who say that Sakagura is the best. ? We were lucky to find ourselves in the hands of "sake sommelier", Momo, and if you're looking for a sake experience as well as a great Japanese dinner, I would go when she's working on Tuesday or Thursday night. ?Sakagura is a sister to Decibel in the East Village, but with a wider range of offerings from $6 glass to over $100 a glass. They serve a selection of sashimi, but Sakagura is a Japanese restaurant, not a sushi restaurant. ?We ordered the sashimi tasting which was amazing. ?Other favorites were the smoked duck, served cold with scallions, the pork belly, the miso cod and the black sesame creme brulee. Sakagura is next door to a sushi restaurant which can be confusing. ?Go past the sushi restaurant into what looks like an office building, head left past the security guard and down the stairs into the basement. ?"Basement" has negative connotations, but it actually adds to the the ambiance and the feel of stepping out of NYC and into Tokyo. ?It's a little tricky to find, but well worth the search.

Came here again this past Saturday, a group of 12, and called weeks in advance for reservation. They basically combine several tables to form a large rectangular table to fit all of us, and was pretty decent, we didn't feel crushed/crowded at all~ We ordered our usual favorites: chilled homemade tofu, sashimi platter (yellowtail, snapper, uni, toro, and macro), fluke carpaccio, ?surumeika yaki (grilled squid), black miso cod, beef tongue, and wagyu beef. We also tried two new dishes this time: Maguro Tartar (tuna sashimi with roe) and uni soba (a special our waiter recommended); both were delish! As for sake, we had our usual and for dessert, we cannot persuade ourselves to order anything else but the black sesame creme burlee! Yum yum yum...everything was so good and I mean EVERYTHING. Also, not an expensive restaurant to dine, so I don't know what you're waiting for! But hold on, I take that back, maybe you should wait longer to try this place cuz I'm already having trouble booking reservations! jk, jk ;) ENJOY!

Wow, you guys weren't kidding when you all reviewed this place. Sakagura is truly a diamond in the rough. As we entered the office building of 211, my boyfriend gave me weird looks as we descended into the basement. This certainly wasn't a place for a 4-5 star Japanese restaurant! Clearly, we weren't the only ones who knew about this little midtown secret. There were no tables available on an early Sunday evening, so we took seats at the bar, in front of all the glorious premium sake bottles. This place isn't cheap. Especially if, like us, you're used to going to Oh Taisho and Yakitori Taisho for your izakaya. However, the izakaya experience here is simply worlds apart from the little joints that line St Marks. Dishes will range from $5 to $15 a plate. Last night, we ordered the following: Buta Kakuni (Pork Belly) The fried sardines with spicy mayo dip The duck breast rolled with scallion The Kimchi and Sashimi Don The Tamago and eel and for dessert: The Chocolate Souffle!!!! OMG. And for a summer special, they had some premium sakes on sale. $12 a glass from $24. I had a divine glass of sake Jumai Ginjo Urakasumi - it was so fine and fragrant, nothing like i've ever tasted!! Mind you, I've never had a glass of ?premium sake in my life so this was tantilizing to my taste buds and so smooth! Going for $12 in a cute Riedel-ish glass, this was the good stuff compared to our usual $8 a serving of sake in the signature white bottle and 2 tiny cups. We had a fantastic dinner and I was very impressed by how fine the food was. The service was impeccable, as we sat at the bar, our bartender/server was attentive and knowledgable in his sakes. It was 5 star izakaya dining. The sake alone is worth the 5 stars. I'm bringing my folks here the next time their in town. The damage at the end of the night? $42 per person before tip. Not too shabby in my opinion... :D

Okay, Sakagura is a Japanese Sake Club located in the basement of an office building. That much said, an elevator or stairs down will take you to a place filled with Japanese businessmen and traditional waitstaff. A suggestion from the waitress on a not too dry, not too sweet sake ended up selecting the wonderful Uragasumi JDG, and that was delightfully light and refreshing for the three of us at dinner that night. Hot towels at the beginning and a very attentive staff with water and cleaning the table, folding the towels and more. The kamo roast - cold duck with green onion slivers was tasty (6 pieces), as were the hot dumplings - yuba shumai - (3 pieces) in a thin skin and special soy sauce. The gindara yuan yak - cod in special soy sauce was heavenly, flaking away and melting in the mouth (2 pieces), and the agadashi tofu came with bowls and spoons - served very well (3 pieces) with bonito flakes up top. ?The dengaku (miso) was eggplant, and had three different miso sauces (2 pieces each), and the natto with raw tuna (5 pieces) wasn't bad (although natto - fermented soy beans - is an acquired taste for most, and has really long sticky strings). The cold udon with mushrooms was a vinegary, cool treat, and the rice - sanma onigiri - wrapped in mackerel was tasty and filling. ?Hot fried chicken - tori karaage - (5 pieces) was excellent. The chocolate souffle topped off a great meal along with a side of ice cream and raspberry gel topping. Much a place to drink, talk, and enjoy one's self, it is expensive, but certainly worth it to relax and enjoy the company and drink great sake. A hot cup of tea at the end to finish the night. Dishes come as they're prepared, and certainly you'll want a few (2 dishes) at least per person, and maybe one rice or noodle dish for every two. While expensive if you have sake, price are much more reasonable if you don't drink liquor.

I seriously did not expect this. I wanted to be one of those happy reviewers, but I have to be honest to my readers. So please don't be mad, people. It was a special birthday dinner. A friend of mine suggested "Ninja New York", but I chose this place. 4.5 star rating? $$$? everything was better than Ninja NY! Sushi bar and all Japanese food is there? No question should be asked! I told my friends, "This is close to perfect! Just follow me!" In 5 minutes after we opened the menu, I was blamed. "THERE IS NO SUSHI? Thanks, man! We wanted sushi!" I was surprised too because on Yelp one of the categories was "Sushi Bar."(it must be taken down!) "Alright, sorry guys, but let's try something they have here." - Correction: The category says "Sushi Bar", but I was told that it's actually "Sake Bar." Now it all makes sense! For appetizers, we ordered Tofu salad and crab meat something. Both were good according to my friends. So Appetizers - OK! For entree, we got Saikoro Steak - diced steak, Buta Kakuni - stewed diced pork, Chawanmushi - egg custard with chicken, shrimp and gingko nuts, and Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku - grilled Japanese eggplants served with three kinds of miso. All my friends liked the food they ordered, but I have to talk about some complaints. 1. Portion was small. 2. Nothing comes with rice. When we got our food, we were waiting for rice to be served, and waited for a while. I finally asked one of the waiters, and the answer was "NO!" I couldn't believe that this Asian food doesn't come with rice. (Maybe I am cheap so I eat something coming with rice all the time.) Especially Buta Kakuni had very think stew, and I loved it. But it would be better with rice. And without rice the portion was too small. Oh here are some more complaints. 3. Food serving takes forever. We got two steak first, and after about 10 minutes we got the rest of the food one by one. At the moment we started eating, the steak was cold. :-/ 4. Sake? The bottles are not the small ones!! (and more expensive than what you think if you are not a huge fan of sake!) These are not usual sake you order at any Japanese restaurant. It doesn't come in the small cute bottle here. They actually have big wine-bottle size Sake bottles. And it costs about $100. Of course you can order glass, but it's still overpriced for normal people like me. :( I like the variety of sake there, but waiters weren't able to suggest any to us. :( I gotta wrap this up. I loved their food! REALLY! OMG, the pork stew? it itself gets this restaurant 5 stars! It's just because of the reasons I listed above. Tip: This place is good for a date. Food takes long time to be served, so you earn time to talk. Music is not loud, so you don't have to scream. Even though it gets crowded, there is enough space between tables, so you won't feel uncomfortable. so.. Good luck! :)

One word says it all - charming, just absolutely charming. (Not the last three.) The fact that Sakagura is located in the basement of an office building, makes it even more exquisite. Exceptional decor with the bamboo and plants, intimate with the low lights, and fantastic ambiance that appeals to patronage for both business and pleasure. The service is stellar thanks to an attentive and friendly waitstaff. ? Whether I come here for lunch, dinner, or simply sake and dessert, the robust menu never fails to impress or run out of things to try. Sakagura serves great tasting food at smaller portions, which leaves one fulfilled without overeating. With that, I can always make room for dessert. The Chocolate Souffle and the Black Sesame Cream Brulee left lasting impressions that kept luring me back time after time. (I can't say anything about the sake since I don't drink enough to know whether the sake is good or not.) Some of my favorite items include: Hiyayakko (chilled tofu) and Tofu Salad; Onsen Tamago (soft boiled egg with sea urchin/salmon roe), Tori Karaage (fried chicken chunks); Gyutan Yawaraka (stewed beef tongue); Homemade Nihachi Soba; and maybe I should just list the entire menu at this point :-) In summary, one star for ambiance, a second one for service, TWO more for the food, and the fifth star for cutting off cellphone reception. Undivided attention for comp anion(s) at the table is just priceless!

It's a big American tourism trend to want things to be legit, local, un-Disneyfied. Whether or not all of this need for "local flavor" has become touristy itself is another subject, but one thing is for sure, the Japanese aren't buying it. If you have friends from Japan or do business with the Japanese, you're probably familiar with the fact that they don't want our stinkin' hot dogs when they come to the States, they want Japanese food! Such was my luck when a Japanese friend came to visit from Tokyo and suggested Sakagura. Located in a brightly lit, typical Midtown office building, you'll walk down a flight of stairs to find yourself turning Japanese, you'll think you're turning Japanese, I really think so. It's amazing - 30 seconds ago you were listening to the security guard sing along to Marvin Gaye on a staticy radio, and now you're in Tokyo. Going with my Japanese friend definitely added to the experience as he took the reins and ordered everything for us along with the waiter's recommendations. The daily specials that we tried were amazing and fresh, but Daikon salad, jaga dango (mashed potatoes coated and fried in a donut batter - YUM), shrimp balls, cold udon, and rice balls are on the regular menu and were very tasty. I loved everything we ate, but the real standout was the sake and we had two bottles of the smoothest I've ever tasted. I don't know what was ordered, but it was so, so good and I'm not sure you could go wrong with anything your waiter might suggest. If you're going to get dessert (which, um, obvi, always get dessert) get the black sesame creme brulee. I had the sea salt chocolate sorbet, which was great, but I found myself taking advantage of my boyfriend's smarter ordering and ate an unfair portion of his creme brulee. What are sig. others for, right? All in all, a really fun, unique experience that I'll definitely be trying to replicate again, even sans friends from Tokyo. Oh, and PS: the smart toilets in the bathroom? Yeah, they work on a sensor, so try as you might to view a miniature Old Faithful, you're unfortunately going to have to be sitting . . . and I wouldn't recommend messing with that if you're on a date.

Traditional elegance, and "hotness", literally. ?Located in the basement of a desolate building, the place was like a sauna walking in. ?I walked a block or so, before realizing I had passed the place. ?It's kind of a little hidden treasure. ?Remarkable for sure. ? Onto the food!! ?I wouldn't recommend this place for sushi, but more izakaya or tapas style, not really traditional izakaya, but authentic nonetheless. ?Did I confuse you already? ?Whether in small groups or big, this place is a must for ordering a few different dishes and sharing them. ?Hot, cold, raw, cooked dishes... there is a great variety to choose from. From what I can remember, we got the fluke sashimi, tofu salad, uzaku "eel", tuna tartare (atop with caviar), grilled japanese eggplant and onigiri and buta kakuni. ?My least favorite was the onigiri, it was uninspiring and straight up boring. ?Highlights were the fluke sashimi, eggplant (eggyork being the best flavored sauce, sweet red being my least) and tuna tartare and their black sesame creme brulee is absolutely amazing. ?(Partial to this, because frankly, anything black sesame is pretty amazing) They have an overwhelming listing of sake as well. ?I mean, it was pretty unbearable. ?We had our waiter pick out 3 different types of suggestion, the next carafe better than the previous. ? Overall, this place is nearly flawless. ?The onigiri ruined it...and though I loved the tuna tartare, I think the caviar could have been fresher (hence tasted better than what I sampled). ?I've had a million versions of tuna tartare in my days (yeah I'm that old) and this definitely was not my favorite. ?Still, I "love" this place and I will be back for sure.

Finally got a chance to try this place out for the first time tonight after hearing so many rave reviews about it. ? The restaurant is a little obscure since it's located at the basement of office building #211. ?However, the decor and ambiance of the place was spacious, yet cozy. ?The waiter/waitress were all very friendly and helpful; in fact, our waitress was a "sake expert", which is no small feat given Sakagura holds over 300 sakes-- the most in the US! ? The dishes are served "tapa style", so one would easily need 3-5 orders to feel fulfilled. ?On the average, the price tags for each dish ranged from $7-$20. ?We asked our waitress for some recommendations (since the menu was pretty dense) and then we winged it with some random dishes. ?Unfortunately, we were in a hurry and didn't have time for dessert, but it's definitely on the list for next time. ? In conclusion: ?Remember the dishes come tapa style and be prepare to drop some serious cash; but that aside, the food did not disappoint and neither did the Sake!

This is basically Japanese tapas and they are known to have the largest sake collection in New York city. This is one of the few places that ?I would take out of town guests to talk and eat. It is near Grand central and the ?Grand Hyatt hotel. They do not rush you here. This place is a quiet oasis from the loudness of New York city. It has more of a Zen Ambiance. The quality, authenticity and variety are the highest.

The same people that own Decibal own this place. The walls are lined with different sakes and they have a multitude of menus dedicated to different tiers of sake (seasonal, exclusive, regular fare). Tonight we tried a carafe of Wataribune and Harushika (from the seasonal menu) and they were both refreshing and aromatic. DELICIOUS. Definitely try the Harushika sake from the spring sake specials, if you get the chance. That being said, when we came here last time, we got the karaage (fried chicken thighs) and they were large, chunky, and juicy. This time, we went for the shiromi nanban (white fish fried in a Japanese vinagarette marinade with sliced radishes, shiitake, etc..). Delicious and delicate tasting. My favorite appetizer is the hiyayakko (cold tofu with bonito flakes, ginger, and soy sauce). The grade of tofu was superb. The katsuoboshi was shaved in large chunks and was very flavorful. I couldn't NOT get the various sashimi donburis they had. I tried to hype myself up to get something else, but I kept thinking about the Sake Don and Sashimi Kimchee Don. My boyfriend claims that short of going to tsukiji market in Japan, this is the one place with the freshest ikura in town. Tonight, our dinner companion and I got the Sake Don and my boyfriend got the Sashimi Kimchee Don. Delicious. They line a mound of very lightly seasoned rice with thin slices of very fresh and fatty salmon and surround the thing in a pool of ikura. The Sashimi Kimchee Don features various sashimi pieces (last time I got engawa hirame - the hard end part that is DELICIOUS and quite coveted). This time my boyfriend had pieces of ika sashimi that melted in your mouth. Yeah. We go there for those donburi. We just can't go without them if we are there. For desert we got the black sesame creme brulee and the chocolate souffle. We broke the soufle and poured the raspberry puree in and it was DECADENT! The chocolate was warm, soft, gooey, and not that sweet. It was still VERY rich. The black sesame, though, was my favorite. It just has a very understated elegant taste. It is toasty and slightly sweet and just very satisfying. I am never disappointed when I come here. Get the sake! Get the donburis! Eat the black sesame creme brulee! For 2 appetizers, 3 donburis, 2 deserts, and 2 carafes of sake, the bill came out to $120. I would say that's reasonable for the sublime food you get. If you don't want to break the bank, don't get appetizers, get a glass/masu of delicious sake, and stick with the donburi. OR, go for their amazing lunch specials (and hand made soba). I think this week they are under $12.00. If I thought I could make it there and back in an hour, I would travel from work!

The food here is delicious and authentic, and going downstairs in some nondescript building in Midtown East to find Sakagura feels extremely Japan-esque to me. I've only been for lunch, but the lunch deals here are fantastic. The other day I had the soba special, which consisted of cold or hot soba and a rice bowl of eel and cucumbers. The eel was the freshest I'd had outside of Japan--maybe they import? Anyway, very fresh and make a note to visit the bathroom when you visit - it's in a giant sake barrel!

Two words: food orgasm This place is so flippin' fantastic, that during a one week biz trip we went here TWICE! First night and last night, baby. I still dream about the 3 way eggplant and the duck with pesto.... My first time there was a night of firsts: first experience with GOOD ASS SAKE, first time ordering the same dish multiple times (we ordered the eggplant 3 times) and first time with the heated toilet seat. Oh my. I didn't want to leave ;) Let's just say that this food was so damn good that my boss had to close his eyes and everyone at the table needed a "moment". Don't even get me started on the desserts... black sesame creme brulee, you are my hero. Oh, shyzzah! ?Sakagura, can I love you anymore? The service was amazing, but the food. OH THE FOOD. My pocketbook would probably hate you, but you will always have a place in my heart. See you in a few months for more food O's. RECAP: Go here & except to order a lot & spend a lot. Standout dishes: ?NASU DENGAKU (the eggplant), duck with pesto, the soup that comes in the big pot, seaweed salad, pork belly, organic chicken, the SAKE, black sesame creme brulee, pears with earl grey gelato, the dessert with mochi/ green tea/ other colorful things in the glass

After putting Sakagura on my long list of places in New York I want to check out, I finally decided to venture into midtown with my mom and Chris to see what all the buzz was about. ?I had a long list of things I wanted to try (especially because the portions are small) and we decided that everyone at the table would order two dishes (to start) and we'd add on as needed. ? We ordered the soft shelled crab (one of the specials of the night), eggplant, chicken, fried potato balls, ?shrimp balls, and one fish dish. ?Everything was delicious (especially the crab) and we all left incredibly satisfied. ? Sakagura also has a LOT of sake's to choose from (they also help you pair the sake with dishes you're ordering) and the waitstaff is really helpful. ?I'm trying to make reservations to go again, but they're always booked now!

The initial entry into this restaurant was somewhat tricky. ?There already is a Japanese restaurant on the street level at this address. ?To find Sakagura, you have to find your way through the lobby, down some ugly stairwells and finally to the entrance of the restaurant. Once you are there though, you will find yourself if a bustling Japanese shrine to Sake. ?The servers seat you and promptly bring you hot towels to refresh yourself before taking on the 200+ sake menu. My girlfriend, who is native Japanese, was put in charge of the ordering, and we had no idea what items from her quick and rapid description would show up at our table. ?As she doesn't drink alcohol, she was no help whatsoever in the sake department. We asked our server to recommend something, that would be appropriate to whatever just came out of my girlfriend's mouth and she pointed out a nice 'lively' choice. ? Presentation seems to be one strength that all upscale Japanese restaurants seem to have. ?The plating of dishes here are beautiful. ?The sake came in an art-glass carafe in a big bowl of ice with wildflowers. ? The tasty appetizers (well, the menu consists of small dishes, kind of like Japanese tapas, and the waitress seemed to distinguish 1st course and second by cold vs. hot) consisted of a rare beef with ponzu, pretty exotic greens, sashimi. ?All very fresh. ? Our hot dishes included several kinds of eggplant treatments, potato 'donuts', mackerel, a chicken meatball like dish and rice balls with miso. ? This is supposed to be traditional Japanese food, so don't expect to find California and Philadelphia rolls here. ? A trip to the bathroom is also an experience. ?You enter what seems like a giant sake barrel. ?There is a chair and desk ( I suppose if you just want to relax?) and on top of the desk is a users manual for the toilet. ?This toilet is one of those you might have read about in home/architectural magazines. ?It is has bidet functions, warm air functions, and other buttons I didn't immediately figure out. (I am one of the few people who prefers not to do my reading in the bathroom). As this was a night with the girls, dessert was definitely in order. ?We went for the tasting for 3. ?It started with a sake drenched orange compote with blueberry yogurt sorbet, light and refreshing. ?Next came a platter of sweet wonders. ?A black sesame creme brulee, mochi and anmitsu of exotic fruits, mille feuille of strawberries, red beans. ?The tasting ended with green apple cookies and black sesame/shochu truffles. ? If you are hungry and like to drink a lot of sake, prices can add up quickly. ?Did I think it was worth it? ?Yes! ?The food was great and the evening overall was with great company, so I expect to spend some money on a good night out.

Oy, i ate so much when i went here last weekend. ?The dishes are tiny, but deceptively filling. ?Or maybe we just ordered a lot. ?It's japanese small plates essentially, and accordingly I recommend going with a group to get to taste a bunch of the dishes. ? LOVES: the agedashi tofu melts in your mouth. ?the cold soba is perfectly cooked. ?Hirame Carpaccio - the fluke, roe and shiso combo is magical. ?Kimchee sashimi rice bowl - one of the more filling options and i can't say no to kimchee, ever. ?Spinach - delicious but teeny tiny. ?Black Sesame Cream Brulee - great sesame crunch. ? SO-SOS: the eggplant 3 styles - I tried two of them: LOVED one and the other was just ok. ? Mashed Potato in Donut Batter - conceptually super exciting but didn't taste much like potato and I wished the dip was sugar, not salt. ? MEHS: the chocolate dessert special - it was not that good and had some fruit cocktail thrown on top. ? Overall, a fantastic meal with a lot to excite the palate. ?Service was also outstanding. ?We had a water spill and a server showed up with a dishcloth in literally seconds. ?They have ESP. ?What a great find!

A fantastic izakaya that takes all the cozy elements of a Japanese drinking establishment without the cramped space of it all. Sakagura's specialty is in sake, if you couldn't guess by the countless sake bottles behind the bar. I have yet to try the sake, but I hear they make good recommendations, even if you're a sake novice or aren't so enamored by sake (the latter, I suspect, because most of us just haven't had very good sake). They were offering Yebisu beer when I went recently, which I haven't seen as frequently at other Japanese restaurants. The food is good for sharing for about 3-4 people at max (per dish). - Jagadango: fried potato/mochi croquettes; chewy and baby-soft at the same time... ?a little bland, and I'd rather they gave us a side of sugar than salt. But still very good. - Braised beef cubes with daikon: tender, flavorful chunks of beef in a broth with the lightness of grated daikon = everyone scrambling to get the last piece. - Nasu dengaku: 3 kinds of miso on eggplant. Nice mix of flavors--the green one was bland, the red was salty, but the yellow was perfect. They don't skimp on the eggplant slices either. - Chawanmushi: Steamed egg custard with salmon roe, shrimp, mushrooms. You'd think it'd be boring but the salmon roe adds a bit of needed saltiness. - Kimchi sashimi rice bowl: Ridiculously simple--it's just kimchi and slices of raw tuna over rice--but it totally hits the spot. Good combination. - Black sesame creme brulee: Not grainy at all, super creamy, super black sesame-ness. Pricey, yes, but it's okay: I felt like I paid exactly what I should have not just for the good food but the entire atmosphere. (If you've ever been to Sake Bar Decibel in the East Village, you might find it familiar here--they are sister restaurants, and you could say Sakagura is a slightly more upscale--but not stuffy, it's classy--version of Decibel.) Perfect for a low-key girls night out or a date spot. I

Eating out in New York for out of towners can be a big gamble even with some guidance and research. ?My decision to eat at Sakagura was a big score: ?it had a special ambiance without being fussy and my lunch was excellent, and seemingly authentic Japanese at an affordable price. ? I had a two flight sake taster for $10. ?It was lunch, but I was on vacation. Then I ordered the jewel bento box for $20, a treasure chest of snacks, which included a rich miso soup, sashimi, rice balls, fried goodness and more. ? I ate my brains out and had to turn down the dessert. A good reason to come back. ?This is a little trick I have up my sleeve now to surprise a dear friend with my saviness of New York!' * decent walk from grand central station * make reservations * highly recommended by me

My ex-boss wanted to take me here a year ago, but we ended up going to Donburi-ya. I finally checked this place out with a group of friends. I found out that Anthony Bourdain checked out this place in an episode of No Reservations. This place is 1st of all hard to find because it's in a work building. Inside the work building, you take a set of stairs downstairs and you enter a new world like as if you walked through the magical closet in the CS Lewis novels. We had a party of 8, and we only had to wait a few minutes to get seated. The place looks small but it actually is pretty spacious. The place has a very old school Japan look. The rustic look makes it feel like you traveled back to the old school of Japan. The food is tapas style. We ordered a bunch. We tried the IKA SHIOKARA : Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade. This was probably the worst dish that we ordered. It wasn't actually that bad. The 1st few bites were fine, but i got tired of it rather quickly due to the fact that it was pretty bitter, most likely from the liver marinade. IKURA OROSHI : Grated Daikon Radish Topped with Fresh Salmon Roe. This was acually a very refreshing dish, a palate cleanser i suppose. It was very tasty. ONSEN TAMAGO : Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup. This was really good too. The boiled egg was cooked beautifully, and it really went well with the sea urchin, salmon roe and the soup when it was all mixed together. HIRAME PONZU : Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette. FLUKE CARPACCIO : Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf. ?These both fluke sashimi dishes were quite pleasant and refreshing. GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato, Spinach, and Shiitake Mushroom. This dish was awesome. THe beef tongue was so tender. Tongue is hard to cook because you can make it very tough, but this was just so tender it was softer than filet mignon. This was probably my favorite dish. MAGURO TARTAR : Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar. This tasted great too but it was rather small. JIDORI SHIOYAKI : Grilled Organic Free Range Chicken Served with Sea Salt and "Yuzu" Citrus Pepper. This was my 2nd favorite dish. It was actually our group's favorite dish. It was so good that we ordered a 2nd order of it. THe chicken was moist and flavorful. The sea salt and the citrus pepper complemented the chicken perfectly. We ordered more, but to be honest, i don't remember what we got. I just remember the food was soo good, and i lost track of all the foods that we ordered. I only remembered most of them because I took pictures.

UPDATE 02/06/09: BTW, the dessert here are hidden gems. All are excellent, esp the pear millefeille and the black sesame creme brulee, which is to die for Serving lunch now 11:30pm-2:20pm. They have lunch specials for $10.95, a steal. Lunch specials change every month. I recently ordered BARA CHIRASHI DON [Assorted Variety of Chopped Sashimi and Dried Squash Over Rice Served with Soba Noodle] as a lunch special...what a deal! Pics: http://www.meetup.com/te… Also tried: -Sake Ikura Don ($16.00) Fillets of Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce Served Atop a Bowl of Sushi Rice,with Soba Noodles ( Hot or Cold ) - OUT OF THIS WORLD!, Ikura was huge and not salty at all, salmon was fresh UPDATE 9/25/08: Sakagura (Akinobu Suzuki, Hisaya, Kadoi) - 2008 Joy of Sake Event. Their featured dish was Smoked Duck - complex in flavor but a big tough for me, still like Kyo Ya's much better Pics: http://www.meetup.com/te… UPDATE 7/13/08: We decided to stop by after Tsukushi for dessert/drinks. Very impressed that they carry over 200 bottles of sake here. They even have Dassai23/50, Kubota Manju/Hekijyu/Senjyu! ?Even more impressed with the consistency of their desserts and the presentation of it.

My friends had: - Buta Kakuni ($4.50) [Sakagura's Special stewed diced pork] - looked damn good -Duck Negimaki - slices of duck folded negimaki style...looked yummy! -Chocolate Souffle ($7) [Served w/raspberry sauce & vanilla ice cream] - I tasted this, very complex, although no idea what kind of choco they use, not Valrhona

Gosh--what a hidden gem for real! This is my new favorite "local joint". I love their eclectic menu, proclivity for bringing together unique ingredients for a powerful (or perfectly understated) dish, and the care with which they prepare your food. The food and experience are both truly unique at Sakagura. Their sake selection is also extensive. I recommend sitting at the bar (the left side/closer to the entrance) for a great dining experience. You'll be able to see all the action, ie: the pastry chefs preparing each order of dessert with utter finesse and expertise, and you'll also experience the attentiveness of the waitress who will pour every few turns or so of sake into your glass. The space is also beautifully decorated--dining at Sakagura makes you feel like you're somewhere very far from the city and it's a great way to block out the rest of the world for an hour or so. I can't say enough about this place and all the wonderfully creative, delicious and fresh food they have to offer. Just go and find out for yourself!

We made reservations here with a party of 7 after not being able to get in last minute (i.e. three days beforehand) with any other sushi restaurants in the area for our planned trip to NYC. It was...not what we expected. But it was an amazing experience. I didn't read the fine print on the Yelp entry that clearly does not list Sakagura as a sushi bar, so my first thought when I opened the menu was "crud, where are the rolls?!" (hang my head as a shameful American!) But I'm glad that I opened my mind and went along with it. It reminded me of a tapas place-- you order many small dishes and share. So all 7 of us ordered one or two different things, and every one I tried was awesome. I ordered the sake oyako don (salmon sashimi over rice with salmon roe) which was droolworthy. And my husband just about exploded with glee when he saw that they carry Awamori. He's been craving to have it again since he visited Japan several years ago. It was $50, but considering it's ~25% apv, it's well worth the money compared to the price of other drinks in new york city. Just a suggestion for those trying to find the place, you have to enter the 211 E 43rd street lobby, follow the signs and go down an elevator to get there. My only criticism was that our waitress seemed like she wasn't used to dealing with customers that weren't familiar with the cuisine/customs and it came off a little snobby a few times, but not enough to impact our experience. Try this place! It's one of the places that makes me want to go re-review some of the other 5 star reviews I've written so when I do give them it means so much more.

I don't think I even need to review this place, but my meal was so outstanding that I will anyway. Located in the basement of an office building, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. After walking down the stairs and winding through some hallways that could have just led to a boiler room, I stood before the waiting area of a Japanese restaurant. My friend and I got there early, so we didn't have to wait even though we had no reservations. We had the Hiyayakko, Maguro Yamakakke, Gyutan Yawaraka ni and the Kaisen Kimchi Don. Appetizers: The Hiyayakko ?was the loveliest piece of tofu that I've had in a very long time, perfect texture, perfect amount of onion and bonito on top. The Maguro Yamakakke might not be for everyone, but I love mountain yam in all it's forms and hardly ever have it at home, so I had to order it, the flavors are very simple, mostly from the soy sauce that I added, but the texture of the yam and taste and texture of the tuna in it were excellent. The Main Dishes, I will definitely order these again!: Gyutan Yawaraka ni: Deliciously slow cooked pieces of tongue in a rich miso base accompanied by tender mushrooms and turnip and potato. The chunks of tongue were a bit large, but they were so tender that I was able to easily splice them with my chopsticks. Kaisen Kimchi Don: The kimchi was delicious, yet not over powering.The sashimi used was so fine it virtually melted in your mouth, half a week later, I'm still thinking about it. Waitstaff were very attentive, very well versed in the menu and suggestions for the food. All around a 5 star establishment!

I've been here quite a few times with friends and coworkers. ?They've never disappointed me!! The place is a bit hard to find, since it's located in the basement of an office building. ?However, once you get inside, you feel being transported to Japan. ?The staff is friendly and helpful, and the food is simply great. Sakagura is not your typical NYC sushi place. ?In fact, they don't do sushi or sashimi at all. ?Instead, you can find a large variety of delicious Japanese hot dishes. ? Their serving size resembles that of a tapa's place, allowing you to sample many items from the menu. ? For appetizers, their Kamo Roast (Slices of Chilled Roasted Duck Wrapped Around Scallion Accented with Basil Sauce) is heavenly. ?Their Seaweed Salad is distinctively different from that from other places, in terms of the seaweed used. ? For hot dishes, I particularly like: Buta Kakuni (Stewed Diced Pork) - Just beware that it comes with a thick layer of fat. ?I usually just pick out the lean parts, and leave the fat. Gindara Yuan Yaki (Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce) - A must-try item in my opinion. ?The fish is well grilled, and simply melts in your mouth. ? Gyuniku Ishi Yaki (beef filet cooked on hot stone) - This is a fun dish, as you get to cook your own meat on a stone. ?Just remember to rub the stone with the piece of fat they provide you with first. ?Otherwise you might have a hard time peeling off your beef. Now, I have a slight issue with their Onigiri (rice balls). ?Not that they're not good, but usually when you get, say a Meitaiko Onigiri, the fish eggs are supposed to be inside the rice ball. ?At Sakagura, all the fillings become toppings, i.e., they sit on top of your rice ball!! ?You also need to wrap the seaweed around it on your own. ?I still haven't figured out the best way to enjoy their Onigiri's, and end up making a mess every time.

To those who bash this place for its price and bird-like quantity but grudgingly admit there's a phenomenal selection of sake: COME HERE FOR LUNCH!!!! As with most authentic Japanese restaurants in Midtown, this place is jammed-packed for lunch with Japanese salary men and women! ?Come early, at Noon, and you'll be able to grab a seat. ?The lunch boxes/combos are solid, well-portioned, and reasonably priced. ?Most importantly, you still get to enjoy the great sake selection. ?If wobbling back to work red-faced is a problem, however, try the $9 sake tasting -- you can have two shots of good-quality sake to accompany your lunch. ? Beware of the location -- it's buried in the basement of an office building and there are no signs until you enter the building!

Came here on a brief NYC trip. Let's just say Sakagura plays a HUGE part in me wanting to move to the city. Poached egg floating on a bed of uni and salmon caviar. Summer set sashimi with fat, moist slices of tuna belly and uni, glistening in the light. Deep fried taro balls swimming in sauce and bonito flakes. Light-as-air wisps of potato fried in doughnut dough. A melty chocolate souffle that imploded on touch. I want my last meal to be from here. It was all so, so good. Indescribably so.

We had a really enjoyable meal at Sakagura last night. ?We tried two of their newly-arrived sakes and each had a Masu to ourselves (bigger than a carafe, smaller and much cheaper than the whole bottle). ?We are light to moderate drinkers and this was enough for us. ?The sake was delicious! We then ordered a variety of items off the menu, all of which were incredible. ?We are vegetarian, so there are many but not a plethora of options (unless you are a fish-eating veg, which we are not). ?We probably ordered one of most of the vegetarian items, about 6 plates in total, and this was a good amount of food for us. Finally, we ordered the chocolate souffle with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberry sauce, and the black sesame creme brulee with ice cream of the same flavor. ?Both of these desserts were excellent, but we LOVED the creme brulee! ?It ended the meal in an amazing way. ? We ate at the bar since there weren't any tables available (we called the day of our reservation), and this was just as fine as a table, although you see the wait staff working so hard! ? As you can see from all the reviews, this place is well worth a visit..or MANY visits!

Came here for the second time, with a large party. We ordered a few bottles of sake. I'm not a huge fan or drinker of sake so I thought it was OK (apparently it was kind of expensive, at $75/bottle). I tried sea urchin for the first time, which was OK. We had the gyu miso nikomi (shredded beef in a stew), the nihachi soba (cold noodles served in soy dipping sauce), the agedashi tofu, saikoro steak, beef tongue with radish, taro potato, spinach and shiitake mushrooms, and the tori karaage (deep fried chicken in sake and ginger infused soy sauce). Everything was pretty good, liked the cold noodles, steak, and fried chicken the most. Would definitely come back because I love the ambience and the menu is pretty extensive so there's always plenty to try.

I recently went there with friends. Overall, the food was good and I would def go again. However, the menu is a little overwhelming and not very organized. Same goes for the sake and (very limited) wine/cocktail list. Pay attention when ordering because the prices add up. Overall I would go again. The service was pleasant AND when I left my wallet there, I was called and everything returned promptly. They get an extra star for that!

Glad I'm finally in the know about this underground Japanese izakaya/sake bar! ? In the basement of a non-descript office building, you have to enter the building and go downstairs to find a lovely, Zen decor that I could say is Tokyo-like but I've never been to Japan. While they have a wide-ranging Japanese menu (no sushi though), I've just tried the sake (they've got a ton to choose from) and the dessert so far. ?Liked the sake. ?Had the green tea truffles and strawberry truffles - both were very good. ?I'd compare them more to bon-bons than traditional truffles since it was ice cream inside instead of nuts/caramel/wafer/etc. ?The chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream and raspberry syrup was fantastic. ?As Japanese as apple pie - I know - but still really good. While this place doesn't appear to be a secret - on a Tuesday night it was full and had a number of Caucasians! - it still feels like a find and I dug the vibe. ?5 stars...

the tori karage gave me a little stomachache, but maybe its becuase ive been eating popeyes for a long time, and my weak american stomach cant handle good fried chicken. DAMN YOU AMERICAN BELLY! the fluke carpaccio and fried persimmon were pretty amazing. especially the persimmon with plum miso paste. i do regret not getting the nabe, but maybe nexttime. also i had shochu instead of sake, because i perfer shochu. no offense, but maybe nexttime. theres nothing else that hasnt been said about this little gem in the corporate building (and no its not enron or merrill lynch).

If Decibel were my high school crush, then Sakagura would be my college fling... (See my previous review of Decibel) Sharing the same owner, Decibel and Sakagura, both specializing in sake, are very different. ?While Decibel has 70 kinds of sake to taste, Sakagura has a generous 200. ?Decibel, surrounded by dark wood, ?is casual cool,.. ?Sakagura, surrounded by golden bamboo, is casual elegance. ?Different, yet equally enjoyable, depending on what you prefer. The food is traditional Japanese. ?The sashimi super fresh. ?Notice the unique tableware. Beautiful decor, great sake.. ?what more can you ask for? Ikki ikki~!

Went for a girl's night out. Dinner for two included: 1) KAISEN KIM-CHEE DON : Assorted Chopped Sashimi Mixed with Kimchee over Rice [Served with Miso Soup] $13.00 2) KAMO ROAST : Slices of Chilled Roasted Duck Wrapped Around Scallion Accented with Basil Sauce $9.50 3) FLUKE CARPACCIO: Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf $10.00 4) ?BUTA KAKUNI : SAKAGURA'S SPECIAL Stewed Diced Pork $4.50 (Per piece) 5) GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato, Spinach, and Shiitake Mushrooms $12.50 ? 6) DESSERT:BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream $7.00 and TRUFFLES Amazing food and a great dining experience: Priceless My favorite dishes were: 3)Fluke Carpaccio and 1) Kaisen Kim-Chee Don 6) Truffles The truffles is very very good. It is very rich in flavor, yet subtle. At first they look very ordinary and if you were not savoring it, you probably won't even notice the levels of flavor that slowly come up. Service was good. We sat at the bar, our water was never empty. Plates were cleared fairly regularly. We had the opportunity to taste different sakes before we ordered and when we ordered one glass, our server was nice enough to have the initiative to put it in two glasses for us without us having to ask. Still thinking about the truffles. The subtle richness...Mmmmm!

Back in my management consulting days, Sakagura was a highly recommended restaurant by the client- who-shall-remain-nameless. It was pitched as a "cool place for noodles". Understatement of 2006. This place is in the basement of an office building (on 43rd between 2nd and 3rd). It's as hard to get to as you think it is. It's somewhere to the right of a nice Japanese restaurant, in the back, and down the stairs. The trip down gave me a shady feeling about the place -- lots of cinder block, exposed pipes, and must. The restaurant itself is a 180-degree turn. The interior is beautiful. Wonderfully lit, the restaurant features rows and rows of sake bottles, and just the right mix of Japanese art and cool artsy barness. It's definitely the kind of place you'd take someone just to impress them with your knowledge of hidden-and-cool restaurants. My co-worker and I sat down at the lunch bar, and were presented with the menu. They've got a number of lunch options between $10 and $17 dollars, and a load of sake choices. We started with some wonderful tofu soaking in some delicious sauce (sorry, I totally forgot what was in the sauce). I give it one ding for not being chopstick-friendly. The tofu literally disintegrated as we picked it apart. By the time we were "done", 20% of the tofu was sitting in the sauce, in pieces too small to grab with the chopsticks. Oh well. I ordered some sake (for lunch, yes), and the "daily special" -- which was a bowl of cold noodles, a bowl of sticky rice topped some sort of creamy goodness, and two small side dishes with unidentifiable vegetables. As you can tell, I didn't do a good job remembering what I ordered. But, it's not entirely my fault. The food was very bland, even though the quality of the rice and the noodles were good. I was served a miniscule amount of ginger and wasabi -- spicing things up wasn't really an option. I was also served what I believe was a box filled with lukewarm and cloudy water as something to cleanse my palette. Very, very interesting. Sakagura is way cool, and it reminds me that I am way moronic when it comes to Japanese cuisine. II hope to go back to learn more.

Best sake I've ever had. ?Hands down. ? You have to have your wits about you to find this place the first time around. ?There's a red herring Japanese restaurant above ground right near this address. ?Walk in there, and a weaker will done for. ?But if you see salarymen wafting out of an office building tipsy, follow their footprints back to Sakagura. A friend of mine who lived in Tokyo for 3 years got homesick for his old izakayas here. ?A mishap of spillage ruined one of our dishes, and they were polite and replaced it lickety split. ? Karage is hard to mess up, and they do a good job here. ?Daikon-based salad was delicious while it still had dressing, but it ran out quick. ? But yes, you come here for the glasses of sake. ?Ask for guidance with the types, and they are quite helpful (or so I think, my friend and the waiter were giggling it up in Japanesey)

This is a great little hideaway! ?Without the sign in the lobby, it took us awhile to find it, just ask the security guard and he's more than happy to point you in the right direction. ?Love the homemade noodles and the interesting smaller plates that usually accompany the meal. ?Its perfect in terms of portions and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket when you leave. ? Desserts were so-so, but I did enjoy the Chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream. ?One other perk that I as a man couldn't experience was the electronic japanese toilet in the ladies room. ?If its working, definitely give it a spin....I would.

Decibel's brother, grown up and sufficiently-well-paid to afford to splurge a bit on food and drink -- that's Sakagura Probably New York's greatest little secret sake bar that isn't really a secret at all. Afterall, 98 Yelp reviews, written up this week (together with other izakayas ) in the New York Times ?http://travel.nytimes.co… , how big a secret could it be? Well, secret or not, it's still great...and not terribly crowded on a recent Thursday evening (about a ten minute wait for two, without a reservation). It's a great pleasure to sit at the long, warm, wooden bar, admire the bottles of sake and glasses and sample their sake tasting sets. Try the tasting sets, enjoy tapas-sized items like beef tongue, grilled squid, or sardine crackers and sit back and be glad you're here!

I have been back to Sakagura several times since my first review and it has come to be my favorite restaurant in NY. Everything is prepared perfectly. The stocks are subtle and perfect. The sashimi is always fresh and amazing. The sake menu is HUGE. They use organic and free range stuff, which you can verify by ordering any of their egg dishes. They have the best Oyakodon in the city. Their servers do kind of such at times and if you are not Japanese be prepared to wait and watch Salary men be seated before you when they are obviously walk ins as well.

The infamous Sakagura. ?How this place eluded me for so long, I will never figure out... after all, it's hidden in the basement of a corporate building on an inconspicuous street in Midtown behind a few closed doors. ? So, I finally made way to this underground sake bar that I've been dying to go to for quite some time. ?In fact, we celebrated my birthday here not too long ago and I can't rave enough about it. ?I had requested a hole in the wall restaurant and I literally received a square. ?We were seated in the back within a square sectional. ? One steps into a sterile building, makes there way down a flight of typical stairs and behind two wooden doors lays this bar/restaurant that produces some of the finest sake bottles and Japanese bar food known to .. Midtown. We began the evening asking for sake recommendations and the waitress brought out her two favorite bottles. ?I liked both. Unfortunately, I misunderstood the waitress and thought she said the bottle of sake was $29 when in fact, that was for just a box. ?We wound up ordering the bottle and I'm sure the bottle was a weeeee bit more expensive than just the box. ?You are getting more after all. ?Thank you friend! and very very sorry ... um yes sorry. So while I will rave about the sake itself (smooth, flagrant, nice finish), I won't rave about the lost in translation prices. ?Please make sure you are asking for the price of what you would like to order. ?I thought I had that down pat many years ago too. As for the food, most of it was delicious. ?The seaweed wrapped rice balls was probably my favorite dish. ?The age tofu was silky and very clear in flavor. ?The pork and beef special combined flavors that are unique and hardly seen in your typical Japanese restaurant... The best part was the company received in a place I've been wanting to dine at for ages. ?That, and the awesome restroom! ?They have the techy toilets that you have to figure out how to use. ?I stayed in there for a good amount of time trying to figure out how to flush. ?Where else can you get that experience??!

This place was not good. Maybe it was because of what I ordered, or the atmosphere (reminded me of TV set for a japanese restaurant), but I walked out highly disappointed in Yelp NYC. Ordered: TAMAGOYAKI TATAMI IWASHI UZAKU BUTA KAKUNI TORI TSUKUNE Baked crab rice special Uni soba special Basically, I wouldn't order any of these dishes again. The crab rice was ok since it included large pieces of crab meat, and was delicate in flavor but not worth the price. The pork belly was good, but I would suggest ordering 1 piece per 2 people. I echo other negative reviews by saying the price did not match the quality of food. If you're looking for izakaya-type food, I would recommend Hagi or Yakitori Totto (best yakitori in NYC). Taisho also holds a special place in my heart.

If sake is your game, this place is so for you. ?And me. ?And one of the best selections and varieties to choose from. ?And I can honestly say I had my fix for months to come. ?But that is not all. I was invited last minute by a friend to try out this place after happy hour this past week. ?When we ventured over from happy hour to this restaurant, my first impression of walking into an office building intimidated me a bit, considering I just got out of work. ? But do not fear. ?When you walk down the stairs to the basement where this restaurant is located, it almost feel like you are being transported to a different dimension of Japanese culture. The decor is quite impressive I must say. ?And to see that most patrons are Japanese, that made it very encouraging. Onto the food. ?We ordered an array of dishes. ?Considering there were four of us, we had a great sampling of oysters, steak slices, edamame (I know, how cliche!), along with all the fixings. ?Yes, you know where I am going with this. ?What REALLY stood out were the oysters. ?Massive, succulent and perfectly cooked. ?And unlike Morimoto's, these were not overly saucy, and they were EXQUISITE! And top my meal with their version of creme brulee, I was in HEAVEN! ?Oh I so need to come back to get my fixing once in a while. ?And I highly recommend you come with a good group of friends!

When the upscale mood strikes, I trade in my flip flops for some killer heels and head to Sakagura. ?Decor is cozy and cool; the waitstaff friendly and super-efficient; the food stellar, although very expensive. The sake menu is intimidating, especially for a beer lover like me, but if you describe the type of taste you want (dry, sweet, unfiltered, etc), your server will find something to please your palate. ?The sake flights are also great if you can't decide on a whole bottle. At Sakagura, diners eat with their eyes first -- the presentation is dazzling. ?Our fresh sushi platter was a kaleidescope of color and texture, plated on a dark brown bamboo steamer with glass noodles and brightly colored mini-flowers. ?A blue saucer and a ceramic sake cup provided "beds" for the fish. ?It was a feast for the eyes...though more a sampler platter than an all-u-can-eat buffet. Sakagura's food quality does take precedence over quantity, so be aware that this is more about the overall dining experience than rolling out the door because you just had to have that last mint.

Happened to read the review and realized it's in the basement of where I normally go get my massage. figured out to try it out and see what's all about. I have to say with all the reviews I read. I am a little bit disappointed at this place. it's pretty hidden, and they have a similar restaurant on the street level. you need to go inside and downstairs to find this place Couple things I would like to say about this place 1. Not a typical SUSHI place( in fact no sushi on the menu) 2. Great sake selection 3. Good food, but not great. I can probably find as much authentic japanese food as herewith 30% cheaper in St.Marks This is the one time experience restaurant for me

Ah my Sakagura! ?We go back, way back like over 10 years. ?I've never had a relationship last even half that long. ?Your menus have changed over the years, but your sophisticated charm remains the same. The list is quite short, the number of places I've been loyal to for so long and Sakagura is near the top of the short list. ?It's hard to stumble into Sakagura given its nondescript location in the basement of a mid-town office building. ?The decor is modern yet traditional with surprisingly high ceilings given its underground location. You cannot miss with any of Sakagura's items. ?The menu offers both traditional izakaya dishes and offers some modern remakes to keep your tastebuds interested. ?But perhaps my favorite thing about Sakagura is their incredible sake menu. ?It was at Sakagura that I started my long time love affair for the rice wine. ?While the menu can be overwhelming to first timers, my advice is to pick a region or a style (e.g., ginjo, daiginjo, etc.) and sample different varieties to see what suits your fancy. ?The descriptions are often as entertaining to read as they are non-informative so go with your tastebuds. ?Once you settle into a sake you like know that Sakagura sells by the bottle. ?There's nothing better than being a regular and coming back to your well chilled bottle. It can get expensive. ?If Sakagura were a mistress, I've shown plenty of affection with the use of my Visa card. ?Oh, but Sakagura is worth every swipe.

I was visiting from out of town, and originally disappointed because we didn't get reservations at Sushi Yasuda across the street. ?My friend had sold it as "5 stars on Yelp from over 500 people" and "must have" sushi. ?Since we had already walked all this way, we looked up and down the street and a guy standing outside this apartment building recommended us to try Sakagura. This place doesn't look like much on the outside - in fact it looks like a standard NYC apartment building. ?Which is what it is. ?We walked down to the basement of the building, and I had flashbacks of doing laundry in my college dorm all over again. ?I wouldn't be surprised if one of those doors actually led to a washer & dryer. ?Going in, I must say I had pretty low expectations - I mean I started the night thinking I would have 5 star sushi, and now I was eating in a laundromat. ?While the waiting area outside the restaurant looks like a laundromat, once you get inside the actual restaurant - it's actually quite nice and comfortable. ?Nothing fancy, but clean and mellow. Sakagara has an extensive sake selection and the waitress was pretty knowledgable and able to pick one out for us given our inability to choose one ourself. ?The food - is where they knocked my socks off. ?A nice combination of raw fish, izakaya, and just homestyle Japanese food. ?Portions are small - the two of us ordered 6 dishes and two desserts and needed to be rolled out of the restaurant. ?The specials of the day were excellent (Ankimo, and some Scallop dish) - my favorite was the Maguro Tartar. ?Make sure to save room for dessert - the Black Sesame Creme Brulee and Pear Millefeuille were SO good. We were both full when we left and were surprised at how inexpensive the meal was - $120 with tax and tip. Thanks Sushi Yasuda for squeezing us out so we could find a gem like this one!

4 stars with reservation. Let me get the non-food stuff out of the way. The waiter didn't even know what was in the seasonal sashimi special. Also when I asked him what was good, he had very hard time recommending the dishes. He seemed new so I let it slide. (plus he was so nice). We had 9 dishes among three people (they recommended 3 per person). We were stuffed by 7th. Must-have: -BUTA KAKUNI : SAKAGURA'S SPECIAL Stewed Diced Pork (Belly)...simply the best dish in the restaurant...got one per person. -Seasonal Duck Special: Roasted duck, sliced, served with sea salt -IKURA OROSHI : Grated Daikon Radish Topped with Fresh Salmon Roe (very non-fishy salmon roe...simple and good) GYU MISO NIKOMI : Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish (very subtly sweet, it's delicious) Good -TORI TSUKUNE : Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce -(with reservation) MAGURO TARTAR : Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar. We got it because people on Yelp were raving about it. It was fresh and wasn't overly dressed (but I'm so sick of tuna tartar). Could have done without -Seasonal special sprouts with miso: I felt like I was eating miso straight up. Way too salty. If it came with a bowl of rice, I would have enjoyed it more -Seasonal special steamed octopus in consume. Too bland. we got it 2nd to last...we were too stuffed to enjoy it. -Seasonal special rice porridge with oysters (all chopped and cooked). We got it as last...we were too stuffed to enjoy it. But i prefer Cantonese rice porridges better. This one was way too watery. Overall, there were some amazing dishes and some not-so-much. If you order the good ones you can have an amazing meal. Also definitely do not order 3 dishes per person (try something like 7 dishes for 3 people and get some dessert).

Bottom Line: Come here for unique Japanese small plates and an impressive selection of sake. Ambiance: A hidden slice of Japan in the basement of a midtown high rise. ?They do their best to give an authentic feel. ?Case in point: the high tech bathrooms! Food: Selection for food and sake can be a bit daunting. ?There were so many delicious things to choose from. ?Some favorites: the fried chicken, cold egg and uni soup, tuna sashimi with mountain yam. ?For drinks, they offer sake tastings along with what seemed like hundreds of varieties of bottled sake. ?We had the sparkling unfiltered sake - very interesting and delicious. Service: Polite and professional.

Atmosphere nice, food sublime, cost more than reasonable. I especially loved the buta kakuni (stewed diced pork): melt-in-your-mouth delicious, every bite a pleasure, though not for those who shy away from fat. ?The fried tofu was also wonderful, and for dessert the black sesame creme brulee was also really delicious. I will say that the monkfish liver was not quite as good as at Sushi Taro in DC. My friend and I had a carafe of unfiltered sake, about 7 dishes, and dessert, and the total was about $100 -- a New York bargain.

Sakagura (if you can find it!) is consistently amazing. There's something about going completely subterranean, sans cell phone reception or linkage to the outside world, that adds to the overall character and authenticity of this place. I especially enjoy trying as many different small plates as possible each visit -- the uniqueness and variety are surprising in all the right ways. Food favorites include: sardine crackers, fried mashed potatoes coated in sweet batter, fluke carpaccio, stewed pork, and thin beef fillets slices (cooked on a hot stone). Desserts: chocolate souffle cake and black sesame creme brulee. Sake: An endless selection with staff "picks", which include descriptions and recommended food pairings. Service is great. Food+drinks can get pricey, but I always feel like it's worth it. Wonderful place for a special meal.

Food here is a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds. ?Portions are tiny but if you sip your sake and nibble in a leisurely manner, eventually you'll feel full. ?Remember, it takes ~20 minutes for your brain to register satiety so just think you're doing your health (and your wallet) a favor by appreciating food slowly ?:p I also love the miniature tumblers they use as ochoko. ?They ?look like a mini version of Riedel O glasses and are adorable. ?Quality sake deserves to be served elegantly. ?Note to self: ask where I can get a set of these next time I go. ? Some of my favorite dishes here are: jidori shioyaki, nasu dengaku, and shiromi nanban (correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't seen this dish in any other izakaya around here). ?I've never tried dessert here because whenever I eat out, I try to order alcohol or dessert, but never both in a meager attempt to cut down on calories. ?But if your metabolism is sky high, please do try the pear mille feuille for me and tell me how it is.

One of the best Japanese places I've been to in my entire life (I haven't been to Japan yet though). Here is what I ordered: KAMO ROAST GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI SANMA ONIGIRI CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE and several brads of plum sake names of which I no longer remember. Everything was perfect.

Went to Sakagura after reading the all of the raves and the hype on yelp, the internet, and the local "Japion" newspapers in NYC and here is what I took away from Sakagura. Please, take this review with a grain of salt. The restaurant had an intimate setting. Very calm atmosphere with the dimmed lights and semi-quiet crowd. As you walk in, you will encounter a long line of sakes (over 225 bottles they claim) that just takes your breath away. ?"Where do I even start??" was my first question after seeing the sake menu. Their sake list was, I must say, very intimidating. If you don't really know sake and you walk in to the restaurant, expect some surprises. They list their sake's by location (of where it was made) in Japan and by their grades (Junmai, Junmai Ginjo, Junmai Daiginjo and so on). I, not being a sake-fanatic, was puzzled by all of the different regions. The sakes can range from $6~$100 a glass so choose wisely. The food was honestly is not worth the price I have paid for. Flavor was great, but am not quite sure if the price that was paid was really worth it. My friend and I walked out of Sakagura spending $180 (with tip) to try 3 sake's each and some small side dishes. I do not understand the hype or the rave that people say the place is. The sake is great but their food is not something I would recommend here. I would come here for the sake. I would advise eating else where and then come in to Sakagura to have a small snack while enjoying the sake's on the list. Now come to think of it, when Anthony Bourdain did his episode in NYC. He did visit Izakaya Hagi with his guests before hitting up Sakagura. Maybe that should've been a hint?

Finding this gem took a little work, but I am so glad we finally came here for lunch. ?The underground cave feel was mitigated by the lively decor and heavy use of bamboo. For an appetizer I had the Tsukune - moist little balls of ground chicken covered in a delightfully tangy teriyaki glaze. ?My main course, the Oyako Don, reminded me of chicken stew. ?There were so many things on the menu, I didn't know what to order. ?I also sampled my wife's seaweed salad with Ponzu dressing, which had some really crazy textured seaweed in the mix. What I wasn't expecting was the gargantuan servings. ?My Oyako Don could have fed two people. ?I made it about a third way through before I waved the white flag. ?I'll keep that in mind the next time we visit, which will be very soon. Hooray for Sakagura!

I'll admit it - half of the appeal of Sakagura is the weird, almost secret location. I liked scurrying down some random stairs only to find a lovely basement restaurant. ? Clearly the other half of the appeal is the sake (which I didn't sample, but my dinner companions did, and they were both impressed). Think tapas. Most of the menu is small dishes, ideal for sharing. I fell in love with the Jaga Dango (basically doubly friend potatoes). The tori tsukune (chicken meatballs) was less exciting. ? The sake oyako don is delicious - fillets of salmon and roe served with rice and miso - ?and tastes like amazing comfort food. ?A bit less interesting (though very clean and fresh tasting) was the cold udon noodle - basically a plate of very plain noodles served with a bonito soy sauce that you pour on top of the noodles. ? As is often the case with tapas, your desire to prevent hunger can make for a steep bill -- we ended up dropping $85 for three people -- which isn't that much, but it certainly wasn't the most cost-effective eating. ?That said, scurrying down that flight of stairs made it all worthwhile. ?This place is worth checking out for the novelty factor alone.

First off, let me say that I don't have very refined taste. I don't need my food to look like a piece of art for me to eat it. As long as the flavors are there, I'm a happy camper. Anyway, Sakagura is a nice little restaurant that is located in a very unassuming location. It looks like a dull office building on the outside with no yummy food to offer. You actually have to go in, take the stairs down to the dungeon, I mean... basement. Lo and behold, there's this beautiful little Japanese tapas and sake bar right beneath the street. We ordered a huge variety of things since it was all small plates. So I'll just tell you what my favorites were: 1) Gyu Miso Nikomi - I'm sure the name doesn't explain itself. It is basically beef back ribs stewed in miso. The meat was really juicy, soft and savory. 2) Buta Kakuni - I love pork belly, enough said. 3) Black Sesame Creme Brulee - definitely delicious. You can't get this at many other places. If you're here you should definitely try it. Everything else was okay. This is one of those places where you spend over $50 a person and you still feel hungry at the end of the night. I probably won't come back again unless they let me order only the black sesame creme brulee :)

This was a truly unique dining experience. The location alone is intriguing (the basement of an apartment building. As one of my friends said, there is nothing elegant about the walk down to Sakagura, and you are likely to be confused and lost. The restaurant itself is cool and clean, and designed like an outdoor space, ignoring completely that ?it is in a basement. The sake menu is incomprehensibly long for amateurs, but thankfully there are several tasting flights to help you get acquainted with selections. (Be careful basing your bottle choice on your favorite tasting. Our top 2 of 6 were $400 and $200 per bottle.) The food was fantastic. There really is no sushi menu. The menu is arranged like Japanese tapas, and there is a lot of sushi and sashimi throughout. Highlights for us were the salmon over rice and salmon roe, and maguro tartare topped with caviar (which someone else pictured). We also had finely sliced beef cooked on a hot rock (always impressive) and chicken meatballs. Pricing is a negative. The sake menu is very expensive, although there must be a great deal of overhead to maintain such a long list. Also a selection of 5 types of sashimi was $50. This seemed high unless there were 2-3 pieces of each. (I didn't ask, but this would be unusual.) Most menu items were much more reasonable, but just be aware of this.

The BEST and most authentic Japanese restaurant in NYC. I would never claim a restaurant as the best unless the restaurant lives up to the title. I absolutely love this place. Been to this restaurant a handful of times and I have never been disappointed by any of their dishes. You can probably blindly pick the items and the food will still be amazing. ?Reason: the food is just THAT good. Atmosphere - very charming spot found in the basement. First time that I went, thought I might have entered into some underground casino but it was really a secret hiding spot with delicious food. Food - the pork belly seriously melts on your tongue. The idea of eating an entire piece of fat may not be appealing but it's worth the extra calories. Their soup base is sweet but not overwhelming. It leaves you wanting for more. Everything on the menu is excellent. I try to order different items every time and it's been great. Service - waiters were very attentive. it's an absolutely must try if you're in nyc. the japanese food won't get better than this.

Basement - sake! Interesting space. ?Good for Sake tasting and interesting Japanese cuisine. Not sushi. I felt a little like a CIA agent or an explorer trying to locate the basement residence of this restaurant, but it's well worth the confusion and journey. ?If you can, go with someone who has an expense account (like I did) and try everything! It's unlike any other sake experience I had ever had and gave me a completely new understanding of this often abused beverage. ?i.e. good sake should never be warmed, bad sake should never be consumed!

I don't know the names of anything we ordered because i let the table do the ordering. ?There are too many darn things on the menu! ?The decor was very traditional japanese, and is a great place to bring friends and family. ? I had some short ribs in some type of broth and daikon. ?I think this was my favorite dish of the night. ?Tender, flavorful, and simple! The uni noodles with an uni broth were a refreshing dish. ?The uni was fresh and satisfying, and the broth was able to bring out the sweetness of the uni. The tuna capaccio was very different from what I'm used to having. ?They topped it with black and golden roe. ?It definitely changed the taste of the fish drastically to a more refined sophisticated flavor. ?I'd rather have traditional carpaccio, but it was still an experience.

Came here twice and BOTH times were amazing! First time I came here was in 2006 with 3 dear friends of mine for dinner. One of them is a native Japanese speaker, so he ordered all the food for all four of us. My favorite dish of the night was the otoro. It literally melted in my mouth. The second time I came here was last winter(November 2011). The quality of the food again was excellent. The amount of food that was ordered was overwhelming and I would have thought too much would make us explode and not enjoy it as much. Thankfully I was still able to discern the kamo roast, maguro tartar, buta kakuni, gyutan yawaraka ni, and chawanmushi all made my stomach and eyes happy. I thoroughly enjoy food that chefs put a lot of heart and soul into making pleasant for all of our senses. The service was nice and the atmosphere hasn't changed much since 2006(it's a little dark but otherwise it's nice and clean). Keep up with the great food!

Ventured over last night after hearing about the place from one of the hostesses who also works at Maxie (see review). I used to live in Japan and plenty of great spots were in the basement of buildings or on the upper floors so this brought back pleasent memories of long nights of drinking and eating great pub food. Sakagura is a sake pub with a great selection of snacks, appetizers and main courses. They have plenty of dishes with umeboshi (good for hangovers or hangovers to be!) and some really authentic Japanese food such as ochazuke (a porridge made from rice and other ingredients--often with a green tea broth). Yum! And rice balls, too. (Yaki-onigiri)....The salmon oyako don was delicious. And the tofu was very fresh. The sake list can be overwhelming, but I respect the way they try to make it comprehensible. They also let you sample sakes; which is very helpful. However, they start with the premium ones which are very expensive--good salesmanship--as these are excellent sakes. So, it is very tempting to order them. They also have four different sizes of serving containers, so that's confusing and hard to calculate as the wait staff tries to upsell at all times. I would make a reservation; there seemed to be some confusion about how long it would take for walk ins to be seated. But the hostesses are very nice and gave us a sake list to prepare ourselves. I am planning to go here often for authentic japanese pub food and great sake...though I won't be upsold! (So he says)

Tough call on rating this place, as it really is a 4.5 star place. The other thing is that it's right across the street from the best sushi in New York, so tough not comparing to that even if it is a different type of food. I liked the location, buried in the basement. ?It did strike me as being like some of the places I've been to in Japan, where (like Manhattan) the premium on space puts bars and restaurants in all sorts of locations. The food menu, like any izakaya, is varied, and it will take you a while to figure out what to order there. But then you get to the sake menu, and your best bet unless you are a seriously refined connoisseur is to ask for recommendations from the staff. ?I didn't get exactly what I was expecting (I asked for a more milky, unfiltered sake), but I still ended up with an excellent drink. Of course, on that note, expect the cost of the sake to be at least half of the cost of your bill, it was for me. I started with some stewed, battered vegetables, which didn't quite match up to the description on the menu. I was expecting mushrooms, of which there were none. The downside is that it included a pepper, to which I'm allergic and just tossed aside. The taste was decent, not something I'd seek out again. Next I got the jaga dango, an potato doughnut with an almost mochi-like consistency. I've never had these before, and they were awesome. I think I could come back to this place just for this dish. Dipped in the salt they provided, I was a rather happy man at that point. Because of the chill outside, I had the ume chazuke next. This was delicious, but that's just my partiality to the dish. Honestly, their version wasn't anything special, no better or worse than any I've had elsewhere, but still a strong dish for me. I ended with the buta kakuni, a fat steaming lump of pork. If you like pork, it's worth ordering. It pulled apart nicely, fat and all. Not heavenly pork morsels that I have had before, but still a fine dish.

A slick sake bar that's somewhat hidden in the basement of what looks like a office building in midtown. Very nice ambiance and fantastic service!

I went here on a date and let the dude do the ordering, so I kind of feel like I would've liked this place a lot better if I got to pick the selections. Though my palette has come a long way from the chicken fingers days of my youth, some of the options like the sardine crackers and the monk fish liver were just a little too adventurous for my taste. Although I have to say the braised pork shoulders was one of the best things I ever had the fortunate happenstance to put in my mouth. (Insert dirty innuendo here). The free range chicken wasn't, in my humble opinion, worth its price. Also, I totally would have gotten lost had I tried to find this place on my own. Now that I know how to find it, I I'd likely go back and order for myself, thank you very much.

Just fabulous. One of my favorite places to eat in the city. And yes I'm definitely enough of a dork to still love the idea of walking into that dry office building and down that dingy stairwell to find this place. I always get the eggplant three ways and the black sesame creme brulee. From the rest of the small plates I've tried the only one I didn't like was the tori karage, not my favorite style of fried chicken. I never really met a sake I didn't like, but if you are lost with the plethora of choices the staff are knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Its a great date place but could also be perfect for business dinners. Hello expense account. If you are freaking out about the prices, my suggestion is to make a few trips out there for drinks and small eats. It only gets expensive when you try to fill your empty starving stomach with the tiny portions.

Sakagura was amazing! Food here is amazing and the dining experience is so much fun and unique. The staff here is also friendly and nice. Loved the atmosphere because you can wear shorts and still experience amazing, elegant food. The restaurant is located in the basement of an office building. So you have to walk into the office building, take the elevator to the basement and then the restaurant is right there. We ate here on Saturday night and I am still craving the food here. We had 2 of their specials for the day (the lightly seared toro with grated daikon radish and stone cooked filet mignon). We also got the Tori Tsukune (chicken meatballs), Jaga Dandgo (fried mashed potatoes), Gyu Miso Nikomi (shredded beef in miso), Black Sesame Cream Brulee, and the Mango Pudding. Every single dish we got was so delicious! We definitely come back here!!!

So one day my brother and I were walking with my dad in midtown when he asked us if we wanted to see something cool. He led us to a nondescript corporate building and headed into the stairs leading to a basement. Confuzzled, my brother and I gave each other looks that said "Dad is out of his mind." Turns out, not so much. Since then, we've been intrigued and dying to go to Sakagura to try the sake and the food. Primarily a sake bar, the food is tapas style- smaller portions but talk about delicious. We had the Saiya Sake sampler, which was a great trio of smooth, fragrant sakes. We also had the seasonal sashimi, grilled squid, grilled chicken, steamed egg custard, agedashi tofu, deep fried soft shell crab and the specialty steamed/braised pork...all were oishi (translation: delicious!) ?Dessert was equally good- we got the chocolate souffle, black sesame creme brulee and the coffee jell-o (though this was not that great, the other two were super tasty). Great hidden gem in New York- so cliched, I know, but totally worthy of the term. And the bathroom is apparently awesome.

Our waiter was very friendly and explained the many different kinds of sake and recommended some sake for us. Forgot what dishes we got but everything came out in very small portions and everything tasted every fresh. It is definitely not cheap tho, the sake were all quiet pricy at about $40 to share between two people and above couple hundreds for a bottle. the toilets they have here is super cute.

The menu may have some common izakaya elements but if you dig deeper you'll find some tasty eats. Try the Buta Kakuni. It's priced per piece but you won't need more than one. The menu on menupages doesn't do any justice. Sakagura recently ran a special on shochu, but the real treat is going to one of their special sake tastings. They'll offer 40+ sakes and a menu of traditional Japanese eats that'll make you think you're trying dishes made by the Ohta faction on Iron Chef. The original, of course. It doesn't hurt to call ahead - once in a while the restaurant is closed for private functions.

Went here for the first time last week and had a fabulous time. The portion size / price combo makes it expensive if you're really hungry, but we went for a late dinner.

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last weekend as a surprise. I had never heard of the place before since I never thought I liked Japanese food much. As a vegetarian, sushi wasn't my thing. But my boyfriend assured me as we descended down into the basement of the office building in Mid-Town where Sakagura is, that I would find stuff that I liked. I was skeptical, but intrigued. When we entered the restaurant, I all of a sudden became very excited. The place was SO COOL. I felt like I was in Disney World because here I was in the middle of NYC in the basement of an office building, and yet I felt like I was in Japan! The atmosphere in this place is just stunning. The food was amazing too. I've never had anything like it before, but I loved it! I had always wanted to try seaweed salad but had been hesitant to try it at your average Japanese restaurant. Sakagura was the place I thought I should try it if I ever was going to, so I did. And guess what? I LOVED IT. And I'm dreaming of their miso soup. My boyfriend and I split about 6 different dishes and we loved every single one! If you like sake, this is the place to be. They have the biggest selection in NY, and many are priced reasonably. In fact, the whole menu was priced very reasonably. For the two of us we spent less than $100 and we ate A LOT! It takes a lot for a place to earn 5 stars from me on Yelp, but Sakagura seriously is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my life and this is coming from someone who didn't think she liked Japanese food!

This relatively hidden spot in the basement of an office building (am I going into a boiler room?) has the best Japanese food I've had in this neighborhood so far. The food is very good, with muted nuanced flavors that don't disguise the original ingredients (I have a low threshold for overmarinated/seasoned food), and of course there are the requisite lunch specials, some with soba - perfect for summer. In the evening (Sakagura is open until 2 a.m. on weekends), the izakaya dishes and desserts are amazing - impeccable presentation and intriguing flavors, especially the black sesame seed creme brulee. Izakaya dishes run about $5-$15. The space itself is surprisingly nice for a basement, and is perfect for a low-key evening of sake tasting. Should I have to live in a bomb shelter for the rest of my life, I would be only too happy to eat here everyday.

I think 75% of the appeal of this place lies in the fact that it's 'hidden' in the basement of a random office building and it's sort of a secret. That combined with the decor centered around sake. Going down that unmarked staircase into a nondescript, slightly fluorescently lit basement and stumbling into this Japanese restaurant just gives you such a great little feeling. It's like you know a secret that 99.9% of New York doesn't know about. That said, the food didn't completely live up to the decor/awesome little feeling. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I wouldn't say that it was necessarily better than other izakaya places in the city. If compared to say...Aburiya Kinnosuke, I think I would choose Aburiya for food and Sakagura for decor/ambiance. I'm not a big sake drinker, so I can't comment on that, but they did seem to have a huge selection of sake and there were suggested pairings with all the dishes. I found all the savory dishes solidly good. The eggplant sampler was a tad disappointing, the miso far overpowered the slices of eggplant it was served atop. There was a beef ribs dish that was delicious, it had a distinct, comforting homecooked flavor. The pork special was fatty and very good, but definitely get one to share between two people as it can get a bit too rich. I really enjoyed the fried mashed potato dish, they had a highly interesting texture, a tiny bit of a mochi feeling almost. I would gladly eat those over french fries any day. And lastly, the dessert was the dish that was my favorite that night. We ordered the black sesame creme brulee that came adorned with a sesame crisp and a small scoop of sesame ice cream. I'm a big fan of black sesame flavored desserts (hence my trips to Sundaes and Cones for their sesame ice cream and Kyotofu for their sesame tofu). I have to say that Sakagura's sesame creme brulee kicks the s**t out of Kyotofu. Where Kyotofu's sesame tofu/pudding was slightly bland, Sakagura's had texture variation in in the caramelized top, the ice cream, the crisp, and swirled little ribbons of ground sesame throughout, providing an overall amazing dessert. I would definitely come here again just for the wow-factor of showing friends the hidden restaurant as well as for the dessert. The meal portion was very tasty too, so it gets 4 stars. The food simply did not amaze me.

I must say, I had high hopes for this place, which it failed to deliver. While the ambience was nicely understated, the saltiness of the food was definitely over the top. ?Every dish would have tasted perfect if they would have be a bit easier w/ that salt proportion. ?To compensate, I think I downed 2 big glasses of water and 1 green tea. ? But if you want to give it a shot, try their Maguro Tataki (tuna tartar w/ egg roe), chicken meatballs, and ebi sticks. ?Those were pretty good.

Its about time that I review this place. ?I've been here who knows how many times and have left satisfied and happy each. Lets start at 5 stars. Deduct half a star for dry chicken meatballs (consistently dry). Deduct half a star for occasionally slow service. Everything else, wonderful! ?Its an elegant izakaya worth the walk down the stairs.

I'm in New York wanting to try something new, something ethnic. So when Japanese gets thrown into the mix, I feel a little - eh, I've tried that before, maybe something else? But boy was I glad to have gotten the chance to try Sakagura. I am a big fan of Japanese food - whether it is sushi, ramen, izakaya .. you name it. I went to Sakagura for lunch (they have a special lunch set that is definitely worth trying!) and their service was really great. They have imported sake from Japan and a really nice interior that brought me back to Japan. (Their bathroom is so amazing! A must see! haha) Having soba with sobayu automatically racked up points for authenticity! & their sesame ice cream with sweet soy sauce. Yes, soy sauce was really great to try.

Sakagura typifies a certain yelp struggle: Do you share it to give it patronage so hopefully it'll stay around, or do you keep it because it's such a delicious secret? Fortunately, Sakagura is no secret. But it feels like one. Using the parking garage as your guide, walk somewhat confusedly through a seeming New York Office building, greet the ineffectual night guard, and warily descend the stairs to the basement where the mustiness opens up into this magical little world. The food is quaint, expensive and amazing. The waiters help you digest the staggering sake menu. And, though perhaps not very Japanese, the chocolate lava cake with raspberry sauce is my staple. As a concluding note, [women] have to use the women's bathroom. The toilet is insane.

Sakagura is straight out of a novel by Murakami. I am referring to Ryu Murakami- the Murakami that nobody reads. The "Coin Locker Babies" Murakami. It is in the basement of an office building. You go down a flight of stairs, and through a discreet door is a whole different universe. Japan has never felt so close to Manhattan. The place is beautiful. It's dark, atmospheric, elegant, stylish. The staff is Japanese and young-ish. The clientele is almost consistently Japanese- I watched four Japanese businessmen drink their way through several bottles of sake, and pass out onto each other. The food is great as well. I had the fried chicken, stewed diced pork (amazing), chicken meatballs and tuna tartar. I have heard complaints regarding the service. I sat at the bar, which I think helps considerably. I ended up bonding with my sake sensei- a lovely waitress who helped me navigate through the extensive menus- and had no problem getting her attention. On a busy night, I can see the service being slow. It's a surprisingly big place and the back room is very secluded. So if you are back there, and there are not that many people around you, you run the risk of being forgotten. I am also not sure about their reservation policy. I walked in with a friend and was seated at the bar within a few minutes. It does feel like reservations should be made in advance, however. The secrecy of this place is not a gimmick. At least, I don't see it that way. It's simply a nice way of setting the tone for the establishment: if you come here, you know about it because a) you are Japanese, b) you were referred to it by someone who has been, or c) you are a foodie. I can't imagine people stumbling into Sakagura with no prior knowledge of its location. The sign outside the building does little in the way of directing you to the main entrance, and I think the owners wanted it that way. Overall a wonderful, unique experience. Kampai!

Best, most authentic Japanese I've had in NYC. Or anywhere else. Period. Nothing more to say about this gem, except that finding it is a bit of a "Where's Waldo" exercise that only adds to the mystique. Great find. Oh, and trust me: get the chocolate souffle. (Yes, they have one and it is to die for).

A hidden gem. It can be pretty hard to find if you aren't paying attention. I used to spend many afternoons here (on the company's dime of course). You shouldn't come here for the food. Its not bad food but the purpose of Sakagura is the SAKE! You will be overwhelmed by the selection. Someone warned me ahead of time and I thought they were exaggerating. Little did I know they carry any brand/type/style of sake you can imagine. If you are looking for food click here instead http://www.yelp.com/biz/…

An authetic Japanese foodie's gem hidden underneath a nondescript coporate highrise. My favorite? The egg custard soup. Never have I had it so delicate! Definitely get the grilled eggplant served with 3 different sauces. So MANY different CHOICES for your tastebuds!!! We were so stuffed that dessert wasn't an option this time 'round, though the truffles were quite tempting!

You can't miss the big 211 sign on east 43rd street between 2nd and 3rd Ave, but if you're not paying attention, you might miss the entrance to this hidden restaurant. ?It's a converted office building, so you enter a huge lobby area and look for the sign to direct you down about two flights of stairs into the depths of the basement. ?Once inside Sakagura, it's like you're transported into a whole different place. ? The food is abolutely delicious and service is impeccable. ?For appetizers, we tried: - nasu dengaku (grilled eggplant with 3 kinds of miso sauce) - i love eggplant! ?it's grilled perfectly, not too mushy - buta kakuni (sakagura's special stewed pork) - yummy melts in your mouth pork - hirame carpaccio (sliced fluke w/ salmon roe, plum paste, shiso leaf and olive oil) - the fish was very fresh, they served this dish first so it wasn't overpowered by our more savory options For my main dish - I ordered a kimchee sashimi rice bowl - it was refreshing and satisfying. ?The kimchee was not super strong, so it didn't overpower the fish. ?The rice bowl also comes with miso soup, which I found to be too salty, but otherwise, it was a really good meal. I don't remember the name of the dessert - but it had earl grey ice cream, pears, and other assorted goodies in a pretty assembly. This place is quite spacious and good for groups, but it's a good idea to always call ahead (even on a week night). ?Sakagura is apparently related to Decibel (the sake bar in the east village). ?Since it was a weeknight, we didn't try any of the sake at Sakagura, but the restaurant has their own specialty sakes, so I would go back and try the different varieties. Overall, two thumbs up for the quality of food, service and ambience.

As authentic as it gets. In a basement of some kind of office building in midtown manhattan, the owners of Sakagura have recreated Japan. This place is a recreation of a typical sake restaurant in Japan. Most people come from the sake, get hungry and order dishes to feed that hunger (I know I frequented one called Bom Bom across the street of my office in Tokyo). Anyway, the difference between this place and the places in Japan is that they focus on the food. There is a huge menu here, so it might be hard to decide. But here are some of my favorite dishes for your first visit: Daikon Salad Amadai Saiko Yaki Buta Kukani Hiyayakko Gyu MIso Nikomi

This is more of a high end Japanese tapas restaurant than a sushi bar. The atmosphere is classy and the decor is simple, detail orientated, and embodies a sense of serenity that is characteristic of the Japanese culture. The dishes range from $6 to $16 but they are tapas portions so prepare to order about 3-4 dishes per person for dinner. I would say this restaurant is ideal for a business dinner or a weekday date. Very nice. Their sake selection was amazing. They have a little side room to hold all the chilled alcohol. Order a bottle and your wine is chilled in a mini bamboo bathtub looking bucket decorated with bamboo and white babies breath. The food is creative and authentic at the same time. Here are my recommendations: -The beef on a stone pot that is being offered as part of their summer special is awesome. It was delicious and so entertaining to eat. Raw slices of beef, a piece of fatty beef, and a stone pot are presented. The piece of fatty beef is used to coat the stone pot (one side was the coat, one side was to clean) prior to cooking each individual slice. It's served with a ponzu sauce as well as sea salt. Yummy. -Seared toro with a ponzu sauce. Generally I don't like toro because I don't like the fatty flavor that lingers on your tongue but this toro was delicious. It was light and flavorful and the toro still had that characteristic marbleized texture. -The tuna tar tar with two types of caviar was another one of my favs. Paired with the cucumbers and it was refreshingly delicious. Imagine a small cylindrical mound of tuna tar tar topped with a yin-yang decoration of black and yellow caviar. Cucumbers circle the cylindrical mound. -The fatty pork in broth was tender and delicious. It's a square slab about 3inx3inx3in but I would recommend sharing this. It's a bit on the heavier side. -The choc souffle and green tea ice cream is delish! Two things I didn't like: The Iku Shiokara which is a raw squid chilled in salt and squid liver marinade. The liver marinade just made it taste unfresh. The soba noodles, although hand made, just wasn't remarkable. I'd stick to the other dishes. Enjoy!

High-end izakaya hidden in the basement of a Midtown office building. HUGE selection of sake... The sake menu is about as thick as wikipedia so I never even attempted to go through it. If you know about sake, I'm sure it's awesome... But I just ask recommendations... which can be dangerous depending on the waiter. Last time I went, I didn't check the price and realized too late the one they recommended was $70 a carafe (a "carafe" is pretty small, you can easily go through 3 of those during a meal). No wonder it tasted so smooth... The bill sure didn't though. It's a sexy place (wouldn't call it romantic), great for a date. But you'll also see sararimen getting wasted there pretty often... As for the food, I won't recommend anything in particular because basically you can't go wrong. Everything is delicious. But that's also why it gets only 4 stars and not 5: I can't really single out one specific item on the menu that stands out from the rest. That said, I've been there a few times and I look forward to go back there every time. You should definitely check it out if you like izakaya style, it's one of the better ones in the City.

Irasshaimase! I'm about 5 weeks back in the US from two years in Japan, and I was positively shocked by the authenticity of Sakagura. The first thing that shocked me is that Sakagura is located in the basement of an office building, directly below the last place I would ever look for a restaurant. And just like Japan, it'd be almost impossible to find without the help of a Japanese person. And this is New York! Their resident sake connoisseur is from the town I lived in while in Japan, and she knows her stuff. ?She offered all sorts of different flavors of sake for us to try in our experience there. The food is the exact same stuff you'd find on a menu in Japan, and just as delicious. If you take a look around the place, you'll find lots of great decorations from festivals all over Japan. I can't wait to take my friends who never made it to Japan here to show them what dining in Japan really is!

Umm... Not really a fan. Nothing was impressive, from the really expensive menu to the forgetful waiter. Everyone is really nice, that's for sure... but as for a restaurant, it did not wow me the tiniest bit. I'm sure it doesn't help that I'm not a heavy drinker and wasn't really there for the sake. I ordered their special shredded pork dish that was OK, some mashed potato donut fried thing that ended up tasting like nothing (I was expecting sweet!) and then these fried shrimp rolls that was just OK. We also got their dessert, chocolate souffle and creme brulee... it was just OK. I don't know why everyone keeps talking about their great desserts and special dishes. Have they really never been to better places than this? The waiter KEPT forgetting some dishes and our drinks. (I asked for my diet coke 3x) and the food came out verrry slowly. Even though I tried my best to keep the costs low by only ordering 3 small dishes, everyone still paid $45 per person. ?You could eat a steak dinner at Houstons for that amount! I didn't drink but ended up still paying over $30. Sorry, but never again.

Came here for a friend's birthday. The food was DELICIOUS!! Ordered the popular tuna tartar (which has an amazingly beautiful presentation) and black sesame cream brulee, and I have to agree with the Yelpers - they were YUMMY! Other than that, I also loved the grill octopus, agedashi tofu, and Sanma Onigiri, which is rice balls with shiitake mushroom, pickled radish and mountain vegetables wrapped with baked pike macherel. One of the best rice balls I've ever had! ? Our waiter was nice and often checked up on us in a non-annoying way. He even let us sample the sake when my friend asked. Don't remember what kind it was, but I thought it was delicious considering I'm not a fan of sake. I took off one star because I'm just being picky. This place isn't the most economical way of eating out, but I would come back for special occasions.

Food: delicious. All the plates we had were good! I love their sashimi kimchi don - sooooooooo good: very flavorful and the right amount of kimchi and fresh sashimi. Their udon were good too - clean, fragrant, simple. Beef tongue was flavorful and tender. Their steamed egg custard and chicken karaage was the only dish that was good but not spectacular. Desserts: Mochi cake with red bean soup - nicely balanced without being too sweet. Black sesame creme brulee - so good. i love black sesame! Sake we had was good too - don't remember the name :( Will definitely be back for the sashimi kimchi don.

Sakagura is a hidden paradise, a jewel, a diamond. It is an exotic place, with the best sake selection in New York. Is more a sake bar than a restaurant, the dishes are made to be shared with friends and sake. ?I've been there more than 6 times, 4 times i ended very drunk, so be careful with the sake. The first time i couldn't walk straight and yesterday i was walking in zig zag. I treat sake like wine and sake is much stronger. Beware with what you order, some flavors can be very strong ?The Hirame Ponzu (Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi), is one of my favorites, the ponzu flavor rocks. ?Maguro Natto: (Fresh Tuna Sashimi Served with Fermented Soy Beans) is too strong, that fermented soy is to be careful. ? The 5 kinds of assorted sashimi, melts in your mouth like butter. You can change the sea urchin for salmon. I find sea urchin too strong. As good as it gets! ? The Ebi Stick (Deep fried Srimp Roll) is good, not to repeat it but once in a while is ok. ? I used Sakagura as a restaurant, i just discovered that is better as a sake bar, to hear the jazz, drink a few glasses. The jazz is very classic, like 70's jazz. ? $200, pricey but not bad. $75 the bottle of sake, the waiters will always recommend you the most expensive one, so decide what you want to spend ?without pressure. ? I will definitely go back. This is my neighborhood restaurant. i was a bit disappointed of Sakagura, but yesterday they demonstrated their essence ? One of the best sashimi in town, sashimi gourmet.

Sakagura is an excellent, clean sake bar - izakaya, if you want to call it that. ?We sat at the bar, which is pretty good for two people - though the bartender was less than awesome in terms of his sake knowledge/help. ?I'm a big fan of nigori sake - cloudy, unfiltered - but the choices weren't that varied. ?The special nigori sake was sold out. Huge plus is that they serve Yebisu beer, which deserves a half star in itself. Tomago Yaki (eel wrapped sweet egg omelet) ?- love this stuff - 4 pieces for 8 bucks is kind of ridiculous (a theme we'll see more of) Uzaku (eel, seaweed, cucumber salad tower) - awesome dish, my favorite could've eaten an entire one by myself Surumeika Yaki (grilled squid) - good, but nothing to write home about - and small Tori Karaage (fried chicken) - because come one, who the hell passes up a change at fried chicken? ? good stuff, but a little bit on the oily side, and literally took 40 minutes to arrive. Fluke Carpaccio - I tend to shy away from the carpaccio's at Japanese joints, but I usually can't resist the flavor shiso (was supposed to have shiso leaf) - shiso salad dressing could be better than fried chicken...maybe. Don't think you can go wrong with the food, sake is a given, and Yebisu beer is a frigg'n home run - but the price points are about 25% too high. ?Walking out after 2.5 beers a piece, a carafe of fairly low end sake, and the dishes above with a bill of $130 (with tip) seemed a little pricey.

Probably one of the best japanese meals I have ever had. Makes you feel like you have found a hidden jewel with it's basement location, and the decor is awesome. We had the white fish in vinegar marinade, teriyaki chicken meatballs, sake marinated deep fried chicken chunks, and one of the specials that night which was beef cooked over a hot stone with an amazing ponzu sauce.

Sakagura is fantastic. Tucked away in the basement of a corporate building in Midtown East on 43rd street between 3rd and 2nd Avenue, Sakagura offers Japanese sets. It is the only place I know to get good soba and cold noodles in NY. It's name (literally "Sake warehouse") explains the decor of sake bales. We also tried some unusal desserts of sake custard and sesame ice cream. Everything was delicious. You feel like you have been transported to Japan and yet don't have jet lag. I can't say that about many of the Japanese restaurants in New York. My Japanese visitors and associates from Japan have verified its quality. Definitely a favorite of mine.

Sakagura's rude and indifferent service adds insult to the injury of being served miniature portions.

Thursday night, 6/4/09 I follow my cousin who is taking me to a Japanese restaurant she loves. ?She also mentions that the duck there is the best her fiance has ever had, anywhere. ?I'm excited because she loves to dine, and she's paying tonight, haha. The place is down in the basement, and I feel as if I'm crawling a dungeon to discover a secret shop. ?Indeed, I find myself at the entrance of a bustling restaurant, dimly lit, with an old Japanese town feel to it. ?(Actually, the place really reminded me of an Edo-themed onsen I like to go to in Tokyo). I see that the staff is Japanese, and I can even hear the loud chattering of Japanese business men just inside. ?Usually, my cousin tells me, the place is usually packed and you need a reservation... but we're in luck and they have a table open! We are seated, and ask the waitress for a sake recommendation. ?We want a dry one, and she has a few recommendations. ?We order a cold one that she says is "very dry." Our first order comes out, and though I forget what it was, it was awesome. ?The second was the hirame ponzu, I believe, and it's delicate texture and flavors were a joy to experience. The sake was indeed VERY dry. ?The waitress knew what she was talking about, and I enjoyed the sake very much. ?It went down smooth, and I felt we could eventually handle a second bottle. ?My cousin laughed and asked me if I was sure I could drink more, cause the sake might creep up. ?But, we ordered a second one that was less dry anyway. The next dish was the duck (kamo roast) she had been raving about (though she doesn't eat meat, other than chicken, herself). ?Wow. ?It was good. ?The cut was just the way I like most of my meat, with a thin edge of fat. ?The presentation was very nice too, with each slice wrapped around scallion. ?Seriously, it was damn good. Next was the soft shell crab. ?It too was good, though I don't remember it being amazingly remarkable. ?I think we also ordered a walnut-encrusted shrimp ball (based on the picture I took), but I don't think it was too remarkable either (nor can I find something about it on the current online menu). The second sake bottle came out, as well as the eggplant (sanshoku nasu dengaku). ?It was less dry, and equally refreshing. ?The miso (of the eggplant dish) had a great flavor that cleansed the gritty nuts of the previous dish. Our final dish was a bit of a disappointment -- a bowl of hot udon. ?The udon had... vermicelli noodles it seemed like. ?I've never had udon noodles that thin. ?Also, the soup was rather insipid. ?But the warmth of the noodles did wash the meal down satisfactorily, and I walked out very happy. If I'm ever back in town, I'd definitely come back to try the other items on the menu. ?This easily ranks as one of my favorite meals. p.s. as I walked out, the sake really hit... and when I got off the train, I told my cousin to keep walking as I dashed to the nearest trash can to throw up. ?All in all, a great night =)

I was thinking about 4-Stars for this review, but I didn't want to be swayed by other great reviews and ignore the reality of the situation --- Sakagura is a fun place with quality food, but its nothing to write home about (but ok to write yelp about). The atmosphere is one of the best aspects of this restaurant. I've never been to Japan, but I assume it has to be something like Sakagura --- therefore maybe I should consider giving them 4-Stars for saving me on the expensive airfare. Service was fine, nothing out of the ordinary. We got a few bottles of sake, and I thought they were on the expensive side, but after looking them up online they seemed to be about 120% markup which is probably typical for NYC (if not on the lower side). FOOD, I'll try to break it down by what I remember we had (although I don't know the Japanese names): - Edamame - soggy and pretty tasteless - Scallops with egg yolk - interesting different taste, wierd consistency, little heavy on the sauce - Tuna Tartar - very good, two different types of roe on top - grilled squid - pretty plain, same as anywhere else - Eggplant w/ 3 diff sauces (miso, spinach, and egg yolk) - one of my favorite dishes and I am not even an eggplant fan - dumplings - eh had much better, pretty boring tasting - chicken meatballs - tasted like the dumplings with better consistency - steak cooked on rock - one of the better dishes, great panzu? sauce They served a complimentary green tea at the end of dinner which was very tasty. Overall, I think it was a good dining experience, but I was not blown away by the food. For the overall price, I probably won't go back again unless someone else really wanted to go there --- I am not opposed to it.

My boyfriend loves Japanese cuisine so I wanted to take him somewhere special and Sakagura was my top choice. ?I'm sure other Yelpers have pointed this out but the restaurant is hidden in the basement of an office building. ?Reservations are an absolute MUST. ?They have so many tapas to choose from and it can be quite overwhelming so we basically ordered everything off the specials menu. ?I am by no means a sake connoisseur but our waiter was so he selected sakes based on our preference. ? Unfortunately, the tapas and sake come with a hefty price tag. ?The service is superb and the ambiance is quite intimate so I will be a loyal customer but only if my bank account allows it.

I try to be sparing with my 5 star reviews, lest they lose their special meaning. After my 2 dinner experiences here I'd say it's a solid 4-4.5. However, recently my friend and I went here twice in a week for lunch, and there's no doubt that it deserves a 5 star when that is factored in. Literally the best lunch deal in NYC. You have to get there before 1:00 to have a decent shot at it. Each day they make 30 sets of homemade soba (they don't skimp on the portions) and a donburi of some kind (varies by day of the week). The first time we went the donburi was Bara Chirashi Don...again not a small portion at all. What makes this the best lunch deal in NYC is that their sushi rice is OUTSTANDING (in my top 5), their homemade soba noodles are better than Soba Nippon, and comparable to Onigashima. The absolute kicker is that this lunch set is only $11. That's right, for the price of either one at any other restaurant, you get both here, of superior quality. I'm so sad that we are back down in the financial district for work now and can't do this daily. Last word of advice, even though plenty of people have already said it...I'll reiterate, try the black sesame creme brulee and the green tea truffles! Water Refill Meter: 4/5 Generally it's refilled before completely empty, but sometimes I have to ask. Very rarely it's a little hard to get a server's attention.

I love this place because it has a certain "speakeasy" feel to it, in the sense that the restaurant is located in what is essentially the basement of a large office building. Their sake menu is extensive (I think there were three separate ones!), and each bottle/carafe is presented in such a unique and beautiful display that you expect from the Japanese aesthetic. As far as the food goes, nothing knocked my socks off as much as the braised piece of pork. To be honest, I don't remember what it's called on the menu. (It might be "braised pork," go figure.) Why did I love it so? The meat and skin are simmered in this unctuous, fatty, almost gravy-like broth, rendering the meat utterly tender. And the skin? Melt-in-your-mouth, almost gelatinous gloriousness. Disregard the diet for a moment and give in to this dish. We also ordered some kind of fish collar (I forgot which one it was now, but I do know it was neither hamachi nor salmon). The salmon one I had a few nights before was larger, but the one at Sakagura was still pretty good. I don't really remember much else of what we ordered, but if I can influence you in some way, order these two things: 1. Sake. Their expansive selection is their jewel in the crown. Try different kinds and ask your server for recommendations. Order the sake tasting, if you can. I didn't, but I would if I had the opportunity to go back. 2. The braised pork thing. Seriously. You have no idea.

This little restaurant introduced me to the concept of "Japanese Cuisine" as opposed to mere Japanese food. They also boast a great sake selection that I one day hope to properly appreciate. The entrance: makes you wonder if you're in the right place. You have to walk into what looks like an office/residential building. But walk a little further and you hear the clatter of dishes. The decor: a little quaint for my tastes, but not a bad atmosphere. The waitstaff: didn't blow my mind, but no problem The drink selection: excellent if you like sake The food: certainly interesting. I'm still not sure I'm 100% sold though. Basically it all tasted fantastic but not... special. Like when your $13 or so plate of eel omelet comes with pureed mountain radish on the side and it just tastes like someone threw a radish in a blender. Or when you order a plate of fancy edamame for $10 and you get -- well -- edamame. Some of their cooked meat dishes were outstanding, however, so overall I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. The bill: steep but won't give you a heart attack. Insider's tip - get on their mailing list; they have periodic sake tastings.

This place is absolutely amazing. I came here for lunch special for chirashi don, but they ran out :( I was so sad. Instead I got a mixed shashimi with soba noodle set. Their raw fish is very fresh and probably the best I've tried so far. The fish comes out in room temperature, and they literally melts in your mouth. For desserts, the green tea ice cream and red bean manju are awesome too. It's just the right amount of sweetness and you can really taste green tea and red bean flavor. I'm definitely coming back early next time to eat their chirashi don!!!!

Last week my husband and I had one of the best meals we've enjoyed in some time. The food was sublime, the service impeccable and gracious, the atmosphere tranquil and romantic. So, where is this lost paradise, this culinary katmandu, you ask? Answer: in the basement of an apartment building in the lonely canyons beyond Grand Central Station. Seriously? Seriously. Sakagura is indeed tucked away in an unlikely venue, but when you make the final turn around the staircase, you enter another world. It's like finding a secret doorway to a magical land. Sakagua is basically a Japanese tapas & sake house. Don't go here expecting sushi, because they don't serve it. Instead, you will find an extensive, authentic menu of Japanese small plates, all of which can be happily enjoyed with a selection from their incredible sake menu, or with a lovely cold beer. We tried a good handful of dishes, though I wish we'd had time to try even more (we had to rush off to the ballet). Favorites included: Hirame Ponzu, or Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette. The sashimi was so, so, so good. I could have eaten plate after plate of this fresh, delightful dish. For hot dishes, we loved the house special Buta Kakune, or Tender Pork Belly simmered in a sweet, salty, savory addictive sauce. This is one of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had. The entire portion of meat was incredibly tender and the sauce coated and clung to the whole fatty, glistening mess in a way that begged you to just pick up the delicate little bowl and pour it straight into your mouth. The Gyu Miso Nikomi, or Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish were also a big hit at our table. The meat, again, was really tender and the sauce, while savory, had some indefinable element of sweetness that was completely seductive. Other delightful bites included: Ijura Oroshi, or Grated Daikon Radish Topped with Fresh Salmon Roe. The radish was like a pillow, or a cloud perhaps, on top of which glistening orange roe were perched. A little soy sauce added just the right amount of flavor to this subtle, silky dish. The steak grilled on a hot stone was more fun than it was outstanding, but the beef was of extremely high quality and the novelty of cooking it on the hot stone gave the meal a playful element. Desserts at Sakagura are also excellent - we shared the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, which was creamy and not too sweet. Very, very good. Best of all, the service at Sakagura is top-notch. I was extremely impressed with their attentiveness, timing, and generally friendly attitude. It made me realize how often service at many NYC restaurants is lacking, or lackluster. In sum, we honestly can't wait for an opportunity to go back.

I have to divulge I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to Japanese food, only because I lived in Tokyo and the food there is so fresh and tasty (and affordable!) that few options here, even in nyc, compares. How delighted I was to find Sakagura! Hidden in the basement of what isn't even a very pretty office building, it feels like a beautiful, hidden gem. It's hands down the most extensive selection of sake I've found in the city so far, and eating in it's dimly lit, hush hush environment reminds me of the small, intimate restaurants in Tokyo. Their food is decent but not cheap (or I would've given it 5 stars). After the first meal, I only go there now for appetizers (I LOVE their chicken kagiage), sake, and some quiet conversation. And for their bathrooms. Even those are adorable. It's THAT kind of restaurant. You're almost guaranteed a great night of feeling pampered just the right amount :).

Mad love for Sakagura. Ive lived in New York for 6 months and ive gone 5 times now. I think that's pretty telling considering the amount of restaurants there are in NYC. What keeps me coming back here? First, its in a fun space, tucked away under a corporate building in midtown east. Once you walk downstairs, its like you are transported to Japan. Second, the food is authentic, and there are many options on the menu. I want to try everything here, and thankfully, the prices are reasonable enough that you can get 4-5 dishes (even for a party of 2). Get reservations. If you dont have reservations and you are a party of 2, they may have a space for you at the bar (which in all honesty, i like sitting at more!) What Ive ordered here: -Agedashi tofu -Chicken meatballs -Shredded beef ribs (this dish is something I would request as a last meal. Its out of this world and I order it every time i go) -Deep fried shrimp roll (comes with a delicious, unique sauce) -Grilled eggplants (im a big fan of eggplants, so this one is a favorite of mine. comes with three different sauces. its a bit of a high price point for tiny slices of eggplant, but its a fave for me) -Karaage -Chicken w/sea salt and yuzu -Salmon roe over rice -Rice balls -Duck wrapped around scallion -Chocolate souffle (my date says it was one of the best choc souffle's he's ever had) -Pear millefuelle -Coffee jello (i was skeptical at first, but a perfect light dessert after a meal) -Red Bean bun

Maybe 4.5 stars. The service was good, ambiance is comfortable(nothing fancy, but clean, nice somewhat rustic interior), and food was also good. Not unique or surprising menu, but all the food tasted good. If I were to pick one, I'd recommend fluke sashimi and karaage(fried chicken) which were again, not astonishing but simply tasted good. Unfortunately I'm not big fan of sake, but I enjoyed their beautiful way to serve the carafe sake. Tasteful bamboo bowl filled with ice and flowers for sake carafe made the drinking time happier. Yea, I'll come back!

Delicious Japanese small plates. After reading a bunch of reviews my first visit to this restaurant was for lunch with a couple of work colleagues. Was disappointed to the core. The food was nothing great, and the hype and the relatively expensive tab labeled a serious no-no for this place However went here for dinner (31st night) and what a surprise. Its as if the restaurant was schizophrenic. Completely different menus. Had about 12 delicious small plates a bottle of Sake and 3 desserts between 5 of us which cost about 60$ per person. Excellent. Recommendations: Roasted duck, Slices raw squid, Deep fried shrimp rolls, Beef tongue, Spicy Cod fish roe A must try if you are in the mood to share

Oh I absolutely adored this place! The restaurant itself is hidden in the basement of a corporate building, so it may be a bit tricky to find but definitely worth the search. Once entering the building, simply notify the concierge that you're headed to Sakagura & they're more than happy to direct you. I loved the decor. Very homely, intimate and mellow ambience. Dim lighting with bamboo everywhere. Definitely takes you away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Now onto the food; UZAKU : ?Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed GINDARA YUAN YAKI : ?Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce STEAK cooked on hot stones BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream There is not one bad thing I could say about the food. NOT ONE. So everything I've listed is definitely recommended. Bear in mind though that the portions are quite small. So if you're a hungry, hungry hippo, you might want to order accordingly and be prepared to pay handsomely. The eel was cooked to perfection and definitely was my favorite dish of the night. Incredibly light and flavorful. The vinaigrette complimented the eel very nicely. Also, the black sesame creme brulee was one of THE BEST desserts I've ever had in my life! Downside? service was a bit slow but that could be attributed to it being a very busy night. Nevertheless, 5 stars for Sakagura due to their amazing food.

Located in the basement level of a midtown office building, this is truly a hidden jewel in the city. ? Upon entering, you feel like you are in a restaurant in Japan. ?The decor is simple yet inviting and intimate. ? Service is attentive and our waitress made several great recommendations. ? The dishes, although small, did taste authentic. ?The chicken karage is a must-have. ?It's best to order many of these tapa-like dishes and share them to experience the variety the menu provides. ?Also, don't forget to try one of the 200 sakes they offer. ? In short, great place for dinner, late night snacks, and sake rounds with friends.

This is a great place to come with a group of friends. Order a few bottles of GIkyo or Wakatake sake, some dishes and watch the evening unfold. The food is good, but the real reason to come here is for the sake and for the uniquely authentic Japanese atmosphere. I feel transported back to my Tokyo days, as soon I start walking down to the Basement, where this restaurant is located. Servers are attentive without over-selling or acting overbearing. It doesn't merit five stars for two specific reasons: Portions are small and....at the end of the day, the restaurant is in the Basement of a Midtown office building. However, grab a few friends you have not seen in a while and prepare to linger...it will be a good night, but dont forget the sake!

SO amazing! We went here for my birthday and it was perfect! I loved that there was a coat check (in the winter this is a godsend!). Right away the staff was amazing and friendly. The Sake menu was vast and the staff gladly offered guidance. The food was WONDERFUL! Everything is ordered family-style. We all ordered something and picked and chose what we wanted. It was nice to be able to eat off of someone else's plate so to speak. Very good place to go with a group since the more people you have, the more food you can try (without stuffing your face!).

Damn! Damn! Damn! I wish I hadn't had so much damn scotch previous to going to Sakagura. My friend also was not a sake lover so I didn't sample any sake BUT I WILL BE BACK. And I will sample. And learn. And love. The food was perfect for what I wanted. But, yes, no sushi. Come for the udon and soba and pork belly and fried chicken. Actually, we did score a small sushi plate that was a special that evening. The pork belly was awesome (sing that last part). It was so tender and the broth was so tasty. Also had the baked Uni, fried pork dumplings, and a few other dishes which I have forgotten in my drunken haze. We sat at the bar and drank beer and relished leaving the stupid event we had just attended at the University Club. Thank you Sakagura for saving my Midtown evening.

Japanese food done in a truly Japanese style, with a kick ass selection of sake, waitresses who call me out on my crappy Japanese, and to top it off, the bathrooms are giant sake barrels.... the circle of life. So this place is indeed annoying to find, what with entering the darkened office building in a particularly uninspiring part of midtown (which is saying something). ?Once you go past the industrial stairway to the basement entrance, though, it's completely worth it. The decor is beautiful and fun. ?If you've been to Tokyo, you know how bland office skyscrapers host some amazing and lovely restaurants on random floors, and this is no different. ?The service is appropriately Japanese- overly formal, very quiet, etc, which actually is a nice change from more informal standard nyc style, if only for a night. ?I speak a smattering of Japanese, and they totally shot me down with complex answers to my weak Nihon-go questions, so point to them for putting a gaijin in his place. ?Srsly, pwned. The sake list is extensive, beautiful, expensive. ?Ditto the menu - looks cheap, but wait, there's more! ?Excellent 'real' Japanese food- sure, some sashimi and so on, but a ton of great and hard to find dishes. ?Example: Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade. ?I do love my dear mom's squid liver marinade, but this tops it.* ?Tapas style, delicious and small- so if you want a full meal, though it looks like you can grab a handfull of $5-7 tapas, it'll take a lot. It can get expensive here, but it's such a wonderful addition to the dark, terrifying food culture of midtown (o shuttered hawaiian tropic zone, we hardly knew ye!) that it's very, very worth a visit. * full disclosure: ?my mother is Italian and has never made squid liver marinade. ?Comment made for dramatic impact only. ? Any similarity to persons living or dead Is purely coincidental.

So I came here with a friend to explore the world of Japanese dishes (outside of teriyaki, sushi, and tempura). ?We ordered a total of 6 dishes: a duck dish, a cod dish, an unagi dish, agedashi tofu, pork belly dish, and tuna sashimi dish. ? The duck was awesome, the cod was delish, and the unagi atop a salad was also wonderful. ?The tofu was average, and the tuna sashimi one was with Mountain Yam, which the waiter immediately warned us was "slimy." ?My friend and I just assumed mushier yams and then found out what someone had already Yelped...it was more like cottage cheese than it was yam. ?Not all that enjoyable, but not terrible either. ?5 outta 6 dishes in, I spoke with my friend. S: Hey, are you still hungry? Me: Yup. ?Are you? S: Yeah. Clearly, the pork belly would not be enough. ?Fortunately for us and for fellow hungry Yelpers, I quickly found the solution. 2 Bowls of steamed white rice. ?Coupled with the Pork Bellies, this filled us up and saved the day.

With all the many different Japanese restaurants in NYC, this is perhaps my favorite one in NYC. Don't get me wrong, I still have a different #1 sushi restaurant, #1 fusion, #1 noodles, etc., but Sakagura holds the #1 spot for all-around best Japanese restaurant that I'd want to take my close Japanese friends to. You won't find sushi or bento boxes here. It's all about the sake and small plates. I love getting the Hakkaisan which is a jyunmai ginjo sake - cold - since it's really hard to find anywhere else. As for the dishes, gosh, everything is pretty damn amazing, intricately flavored, and thoughtfully prepared. I will ALWAYS get the butanokakuni - pork belly - it's like basically all fat when you look at it but my oh my, it's so worth the calories. And I like to finish the meal with a rice ball. Not rice bowl, but a rice ball. It's rice packed together into a little triangular shape with your choice of fish, pickled vegetable inside, wrapped with nori - seaweed - on the outside. Don't be disturbed by the fact that it's in the basement of an office building. I think it kinda adds to its charm b/c it's like a tucked away gem for true foodies and Japanese folks.

Well, I've never been out for Japanese tapas before - so I have very little comparison. But my problem with tapas is that I hate making choices. This results in my eating companion making the choices and it's hard to remember everything I ate. My friend and I sat at the bar, which on some level I like more than at a table (it's easier to talk to someone right next to you). Let me try to remember all that we ordered: a beef dish that cooked on a hot rock (very cool), egg custard (loved it!), a rice dish with those red balls (not memorable), a vegetable dish suggested by our waitress (very good). Overall, it was a good experience. Environment: It felt like any normal Japanese restaurant. I like that they have a waiting area apart from the eating area. Perfect lighting. Would be impossible for me to find on my own. Service: Decent. Our waitress was nice about us ordering sporadically. Food came out at a decent pace.

Nice little japanese place, with lots and lots of sake selections. ?The waitress seems to know a lot about each kind and which were good and which ones we should not try. ? Each dish is very small, and it felt like a japanese dimsum style kind of dinner where we all picked off a little of each plate. ?Just like everyone else who has reviewed this restaurant, the kaisen kim-chee don was great. ?the assorted chopped sashimi mixed with kimchee and rice was filling and satisfied my sushi cravings. ? The tuna Tartar is another recommendation i have for you sushi lovers. ?The Caviar on top of the tartar went quite well together. ?To top it off, we were celebrating 2 friends birthdays and the waitress knew, so she asked me for their names and then came out with a bday song and candles during the dessert. ?And whipped out a classic Polaroid camera to take our picture which we were able to keep. ? Also must have the dessert dish Black sesame creme brulee. ?you'll love it , I gurantee it.

I've been to Sakagura 3 times now and every time has been an amazing food experience. ?I'm not Japanese nor will I pretend to know what authentic Japanese food tastes like, but I do know that Sakagura has never disappointed me. The atmosphere in this restaurant is definitely not what I expected the first time I walked in. ?It's a huge space with high ceilings and giant barrels (which are actually the bathrooms). ?The tables are nicely spaced apart which I think is hard to come by in NY when sometimes you feel like you're having dinner with the table beside you. ?Reservations are recommended as this place has gotten to be quite popular and busy, but if you go on a week night, the wait may not be too long. The service is friendly and smiley. ?They're also pretty informed about the sake menu in case you aren't. ?The menu is huge and there are tons of choices. ?The list of specials on the front page are always good choices. ?Other good choices include the soft boiled egg and uni cold soup, grilled octopus, salmon sashimi bowl, grilled beef on stones and the cold tofu. ?There are so many options to explore that you can really get whatever you're in the mood for at this upscale sake bar. I'd put this in my top 5 places in NYC. ?Love it and will continue coming here.

Sakagura is probably my favorite place for sushi in Manhattan. There is an excellent choice of sakes that the server will let you sample. While the food and drinks are very pricey, it's well worth your money, and hands down better than Koi, and slightly better than EN. Only negative thing, or positive depending on how you look at it, is that there is no cell phone reception because the restaurant is located in the sub-basement of an office building.

Absolutely delicious. ? The walk down to the basement can be misleading. ?It smelled funky (basements have a smell!), and looked unpromising. ?However, once you get in, it looks like a hidden treasure, tucked away in secret, a heaven for your taste buds. Warning: the portions are undeniably small. ?Go for dessert somewhere else (to get that feeling of - aaahhhhh, now I'm full). Speciality: a wonderful array of sake. ?I've never seen a thicker, more extensive sake menu. ?They sure live up to their name (Sakagura means Sake Cellar).

Most previous reviews really summarize this fantastic Japanese spot. ?This sake list has yet to be beat in NYC and the food is a great match for drinking. ? Just two items I'd like to add: ?first, for those friends you bring not interested in sake, there's a nice selection of sake cocktails which are divine; second, Saka Gura hosts a number of tastings throughout the year. ?My favorite is the spring sake tasting, though they do sponsor tastings from a variety of producers and areas to give the novice a better nose. ?Their special sessions are quite reasonably priced! Enjoy!

Originally planned to give 4 stars. The food was fresh, seasoned well, just a little overpriced and nothing really blew my mind. The sake list was really comprehensive but wayyyyy too overpriced. The decor was interesting but not over the top, and the atmosphere is good for couples or groups alike because the tables are very nicely spaced. Bumped the 4 stars to 5 because the dude sitting two tables from us got on one knee and proposed to his girlfriend, and she said yes. =)

My 100th review--hmm, no pressure here, really. I've loved Sakagura for years--great food (one friend swears the soba there is the best he's had since Japan, and I'm addicted to the onigiri), an incredible sake list, and an amazingly serene atmosphere that drops your blood pressure by 20 points just by walking in. Not to mention the occasional, Insane sake tastings (think the -entire- bar lined with bottles). Plus it's owned by the same people who run Decibel (love!) and the quickly-defunct Megadecibel. They added an outstanding pastry chef a couple of years ago as well, so now it's even more full of win. ? Plus the coolest entrance ever. ?It never fails to amuse me to bring a new person there--their expression is all 'Umm, you're leading me down the icky basement stairs? Great....' then they walk in the door. ?It and Decibel are like Japanese speakeasies, only with excellent sake instead of bathtub hooch, and no police raids. My only complaint? Now there's the big sign outside the entrance, and everyone else knows about it too. *laugh*

Loved this restaurant. ?A bit pricy, but fresh food and large menu. ?The restaurant is in a basement with a very nice ambiance. ?Good sashimi and other small plates as well. ?The drinks overpriced even by NY standards. ?There is noodle house next door that has a cute lounge, that I would recommended stopping by for happy hour. ?Great Lychee martinis!

Totally unimpressed. After reading a ton of the reviews of this place, I expected a lot. I found our waiter to be bat-shit stupid, the food was hardly edible, reading and actually understanding what the hell the menu was talking about was frustrating, and I nearly died of thirst waiting for someone to refill my glass. At least I was in good company, or else I might have stuck my face onto the hot stone that my friends steak came on. For the high price, there are literally thousands of other places in NYC that will give you better service, higher quality food, and superior ambiance... save your loot.

We went here on a recommendation from a friend as their "best sushi in NYC" entry. ?It was only after we went that I read the rave reviews on here and I have to agree, it is pretty freaking awesome. ?Once you find the place, which isn't easy, and cross into the dining room, you step into a teleporter and enter into what feels exactly like Japan. We went super late (11:45 I think) on a Friday (far and away the best time to pound raw fish) and were almost the only people there so our service was great and the food was spectacular. ?The atmosphere is awesome. ?We had a great time all around, can't wait to go back and further explore the menu. I should say that this is not a place for people whose idea of sushi is a California roll right next to a mayo drenched spicy tuna roll. ?I'm pretty sure nothing like that is even on the menu. ?This is for hard core sushi aficionados who can handle some fermented soy beans on there perfectly tender maguro. ?There are things to tide over the less adventurous but you'll have the most fun if you can branch out and try some different stuff.

What can you say, if you've eaten here you feel cooler just for doing so. ?The place is marvelously cool, not for its over the topness, or for a 6 million dollar staircase. The experience tranports you to Tokyo. ?The sake prices if you go high end are outrageous. I can tell you that I have a better appreciation for good sake now more than ever. ?I would still trade a glass of 2004 Can Blau for any of the sake there but that's just me. The food is very traditional and very good, nothing visionary here. ?The experience and ambience is worth the price though, and this is something I usually would never say with regard to food.

Hidden in the basement of an office building, this place had the best lunch deals, an array of sake and the best black sesame creme brulee ever!!!!

I wasn't too pleased. ?We had tuna with mountain yam which looked like creamy, white spit. ? The soba noodles were mediocre, but the short ribs were good. ?My friend recommended the pork belly, which I didn't order because it wasn't listed on the menu! Kickin myself in the ass.

Feels like you are going to a speak-easy japanese restaurant! Food was fantastic and very varied in flavor. ?Service was fantastic. ? Food came out in a sensible order. ?Cold things first, then at a perfect pace, the hot plates, followed by the starches and ?then finally dessert was offered but not forced upon us. ?I really do appreciate a well-timed meal! Cold Highlights were the housemade tofu salad and daikon salad with spicy cod roe dressing - chef's specialty sushi platter was a great deal - 15 slices for $45! Hot Highlights: ?Agadashi tofu in a savory broth and grilled eggplant with 3 types of miso sauce. Starch: ?Soba noodles (cold with dipping sauce and wasabi and scallion) and rice balls (salmon roe and cod roe). ?The rice was perfectly textured. ?Not too moist, and not too dry. Dessert: ?The sesame creme brulee was amazing as was the earl tea ice cream with poached pear. Everything was beautifully presented and the final bill for three people was about $60 each with tax and tip. ?Wonderful meal at a great value.

After my soup at Arirang, I figured I needed to go to yet another "hidden" restaurant. ?This one had over 250 Yelp reviews, so I knew I wasn't discovering anything, but it's in a basement! That has to count for something! Maybe I ordered wrong -- I went with the Tsukune, a salmon onigiri, and the Maguro Tororo. ?The Tsukune was tasty although a little fatty and overwhelmed by the teriyake sauce. I've had the same dish at Aburiya Kinnosuke, and their version is far superior IMHO, coming right out of the robata. ?The salmon onigiri was fine. ?Not fantastic, very edible, and not expensive. ? A little too much rice for my taste, and the salmon was a little dry (again, I could favorably replicate this at oms-b). ?The soba in the Maguro dish was quite good, but it didn't knock my socks off. ?On a whole, the dish was good, fresh, and well flavored, but no better than anything else I've had. ? The decor is very cool and the service is good, so this was on the whole a positive experience, but I just wasn't blown away.

Not sure I can add much to the hundreds of yelp on Sakagura. All I can say is yum... and that I've had my share of soy based pudding as a kid, but the Tonyu Pudding is the best I've ever had. To die for. Also highly recommend the Zuke. Fantastic fish, fantastic flavor combination and fantastic value. Kake Soba is okay, and the homemade ginger ale is a little overwhelming, but overall great food. My only complaint - they had last call for food, and my yakatori order was placed about 5 minutes before that point, and 10 minutes later they told me they had already broken down the grill. I left hungry. Not cool. But dispite that, I would go back.

So I've always heard that the Italians pair great wines to compliment their food however the japanese ?pair great foods to compliment their Sake. ?This is the place that demonstrates that exact saying. ?A big menu of small dishes to compliment your oh so yummy sake! a perfect place to come with a few friends and chat the night away...

Excellent quality, freshly prepared food in Midtown. My salmon dish was excellent. My date loved his dish too which at the moment I can't remember what it was. All the fish was very fresh.

This is my bro's favorite Japanese place in NYC and I've gotten to try it twice. So delicious! Not sure I can remember everything I've ever gotten here but here are the highlights of deliciousness!!: JAGA DANGO : Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp $6.00 -- best thing in the world. so delicious i can't even put into words... GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato ---- really good if you like beef tongue, I can't get over the texture (and what it is, hello!) but my parents/brother liked it -- for Mother's Day, we also got this Kobe beef thing that was a special, IT WAS AMAZING. ok, onto desserts. i love desserts so maybe i'm biased but my brother normally doesn't like desserts and he is OBSESSED: BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE ?with Black Sesame Ice Cream $7.00 --- one of the most amazing things you'll ever eat CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with vanilla Ice Cream & Raspberry Sauce $7.00 ? with " DARUMA AGED SAKE " $14.00 -- yummy! this place is delicious and worth every penny (lots of pennies, be prepared, our bill each time has been pretty pricey)

The food at Sakagura is pretty outstanding. Enter through an unassuming office-space type entrance, go downstairs and enter a beautifully decorated izakaya. Best plates? Kamo Roast (sliced duck), Agedashi Tofu, Buta Kakuni (stewed diced pork) Will definitely be back - especially to check out the sake menu as well!

The four star is an average. ?5 stars for the atmosphere and the sake selection, 3 stars for the food. ? There were a few standout dishes, e.g. ?the chilled tofu, the stew pork cube. ?But really, we enjoyed the atmosphere and giant sake list. ?Once you walk in, you feel like you're in Japan!

This is well hidden in the basement of an apartment bldg.. if it weren't for the Yelp reviews, I might have shied away from finding it... but, it was worth the adventure! ? I probably never experienced Japanese food this way and was really happy with my culinary experience. ?Our server was really very nice and generous with her time, explaining what it was we were ordering and giving us good recommendations. The food is generally presented as a tapas style so you order lots of little dishes to be shared. Would definitely come back to experience some more..!

Sakagura? ?A NYC sake bar? wha? Coming from DC where there is NO decent Japanese restaurants OR a sake bar for the matter, I didn't hesitate to try this place out after seeing that it had 4.5 star reviews from yelp. ?So how good is a 4.5* place in NYC? Pretty damn good. Atmosphere: The interior design in a lot of hip Japanese restaurants and bars in the US give a fake "western-fusion" type of feel. ?Sakagura reminded me of a traditional sake bar in Japan with an authentic contemporary twist. ?I loved it. Sake: I'm no sake expert and for the most part, my experiences have been limited to Junmai sake. ?Do I know all the subareas of Junmai? Nope...so...I had to go with the recommendations of the server. ?Was it pretty good? Yes. Was it the best? No. ?Did I spend everything in my bank account for it? No. ?So in the end, I can't be too critical about this. Food: Sashimi platter was a mix bag. ?The uni was an absolute standout and was probably the best uni that I had in the US and I mean THE BEST. The rest of the sashimi platter? Eh....very good but still not comparable to the best I've had in Japan. some other things that were ordered that were standouts: GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : ?Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato, Spinach, and Shiitake Mushrooms ?$12.50 Sliced beef....(it's not on the website menu). ?This was the standout dish along with the uni in my opinion. One thing I found was very interesting about this place is the way they pour sake into your boxed cup. ?Sake is overpoured into the box and is allowed to overflow into the dish below the box. ?I have never seen this done before. ?I guess there is still something new to learn from Japanese restaurants and sake bars... So in sum......I would have to give this place 4.5*...can't quite give it a 5* b/c the some of the sashimi slices were slightly lower than my expectations but everything else was simply fantastic.

This place is awesome!! My coworker and I stumbled upon this place for lunch the other day and we had such a great meal. Only minor complaint was the service was a bit slow, but I guess what can you expect on a busy Friday. I was somewhat rushed to get back to work after our 1.5-hour lunch though.....Definitely deserves at least 4 stars though. This place has awesome lunch options and just delicious amazing food overall. I went with the combo of salmon sashimi and roe served over rice with cold soba noodles on the side. The soba are served with dipping sauce that is very delish, along with some pickled vegetable that was tastey... but I'm not quite sure what it was. I will definitely be back for their sashimi, it is very delicious. My coworker had the hot duck served in a hot soba noodles soup. She also loved it and we vowed to come back here. The ambiance is also really cool. It's underground in a random building, but when you walk into the restaurant it sort of has a cave feeling. It feels like what I thought a traditional Japanese restaurant should. I really wished I'd taken a picture of the place and the food. Great experience.

A stunningly good Japanase place. I am not an expert on Japanese food but it seems very authentic (about half of the guests were Japanese, yesterday) and the sake collection is also very nice (if you have not yet had sake with Japanese food this is the place to do it!) They do "tapas-style" dishes and my favorite dishes were a grilled squid and a delicious wrap of prawns and algues.

Came here with my boyfriend a couple of days ago and it was definitely the most legit meal we had all weekend. We went July 4th so it was pretty quiet but I can imagine it being a restaurant filled with tons of Japanese people on regular weeknights. It's in the basement of an office building and the walk down the stairs and such is quite sketchy, which shows all the more that the restaurant has to only show for pure quality in its food. Our waiter was very nice, attentive, and gave us a heads up about certain dishes we ordered such as the tuna sashimi in grated mountain yam (kind of sticky paste that we were not ready for), and other things. He also gave us great recommendations for a sake list that is intimidatingly long. A couple of the servers explained our dishes while others did not. All in all, it was a very quiet and peaceful meal and the food was solid. The braised pork belly, yum. Sashimi with daikon radish, great. Sake berry, awesome.

I first went here with my ex. She's a huge sashimi fan - so it was either here or Yusada. My friend finally convinced me of this place saying it was nice quiet, intimate and spacious place. If you're trying to get to know someone, or want a quiet night with someone special without having people eavesdrop on your conversation. ?This would definitely be the place to go. Taking the elevator down an office building basement felt like I was being transported to Tokyo. I've been here twice since the first time in 09 and its yet to disappoint me. Everything I had here has been delicious. Not the best place for sashmi selection but everything they had was super fresh! The Chocolate souffle was the best in NYC I ever had. Actually might be the best I ever had period. Their seasonal Mango souffle is super dupaaaaa fly but only available late summer/early fall. GET THE JIDOR SHIOYAKII!!! Best everrrrrrrr besides that I'd recommend the Ebi Stick and SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU! Actually, I haven't had anything disappointing here exceptttt the Udon and Soba! It makes sense its a izakaya ("beer" food) place and not a noodle shop. So avoid them! Sake is selection is the best in town but a ?bit overpriced but what do you expect? You're in a Mid-town restaurant and not drinkin rice wine in Chi-town Anyway, great spacious place to hang out for a quiet date, or pregame dinner with your buddies. I'd recommend going to Yasuda first if you had a craving for sushi, and strictly desert at Sakagura.

Sakagura turned me away a few years ago, when we all showed up in shorts and t-shirts. ?Perhaps something was lost in translation, because this time the place certainly seemed casual enough. Fast forward to an evening with a bunch of Japanese people, and we had a great time. ?Ordered one bottle of sake and got another one on the house. ?All sorts of random japanese dishes that I didn't understand that weren't on the english menu. ?Thank god for japanese speakers. Atmosphere is great. ?Love this place. ?It's in a pointless neighborhood, which means the opportunities to go here are fairly minimal, but it's possibly even worth a ride on the green line..

Sakagura is truly an amazing spot if you manage to find it. It is located in the basement of an office building and upon entering feels like you've been whisked away to a typical japanese spot in tokyo. ?The sake selection is endless and the food is out of this world. ?Keep in mind however that izakaya (japanese tapas) tends to serve very small portion and that is consistent with japanese customs because they believe in quality over quantity and they also hate to waste food. If you are a big eater like I am then I suggest the following: 1) be prepared to shell out about $50-60 pp , drinks not included. 2) have a light snack before you come here. Don't forget to finish off your meal with their chocolate souffle. it's probably the best i've had in the city. ?Cha-an (japanese tea house) in the st-marks area serves desserts straight from sakagura and we'll leave that magnificent tea house for another review, another day. ? Overall, a great first date place or business dinner spot and if you are a guy you will definitely impress your date/ associates with this hidden gem. very cosy and casual.

I found Sakagura via Yelp and was very glad I listened to my fellow yelpers. ? The basement location added a little fun and mystery to the evening. ?The cool decor incorporating sake jugs and bamboo made for a nice atmosphere. ?We sat at the bar and I was pleasantly surprised to note that we weren't seated too close to other customers (which seems to happen often in a bar situation). ? As for food, we ate a lot but what stuck out was the balls of mashed potatoes fried in doughnut batter and the sashimi. ? It's been a few weeks since I ate there but I had a great time and of all the restaurants I went to during my NYC trip this was one of two favourites! ?I would go back again.

If you're never been there you should take the low ratings with a grain of salt -- No, this is *not* a sushi restaurant. It's a izakaya and all of the food reflects that. If you're not familiar with the concept, a izakaya is essentially a "Japanese pub." This place is basically translated as... sake ground, just call it "drinking hole." As for the people complaining about the price...I'd take that with a grain of salt as well. It fairly priced, like a typical izakaya should be. Our party consisted of three, we ate a lot of food, I drank two beers (the money waster), and the bill hovered around $70. Check out the pictures, these are things you will have trouble finding in most "Japanese" restaurants in the U.S. (though those of you in NY are generally lucky given the high number of Japanese-owned businesses in Manhattan). The layout and atmosphere does feel like you're in shinjuku--even the building, once you walk in, reminds me of Japan--so if you've been to Tokyo and are nostalgic for an izakaya, I'd check this place out. Or maybe if you're in the mood for a free Japanese lesson. I know this place advertises their sake; if you're concerned about the price then here's some advice: don't drink it! But if you eat out often or have common sense then you already know this... I wish they had a few more items on the menu such as takoyaki, or maybe even katsuo sashimi, but I'll come back!

Amazing amazing food. Went here with my mother in law last night (she is Japanese) and I think it was the happiest I have ever seen her :) We got (3 of us shared) (all wonderfully delectable): --Gomaee (spinach in a tahini dressing - dressing was so creamy and good - I need to figure out how to make it like this) --Gomuku Kinpira (lotus root, burdock, some other stuff, little bit of beef - tiny portion, but also really good - couldn't really taste or see the beef) --Tofu salad (just lettuce and tomatoes with a block of soft tofu, topped with some sort of Tsukemono - very simple and very yum) --Seaweed salad (a bunch of seaweeds over a some lettuce - best dressing ever - dressings come on the side and you pour them on btw) Then: --Saikoro steak (small pieces of steak in a minced oniony sauce... tender and flavorful) --Tori karaage (fried chicken - best karaage any of us had ever had - and we all eat Japanese food a lot!) With: --2 orders of the Homemade Nihachi soba (best soba we've ever had too!) (these were for my husband and his mom) --Miso yakionigiri (grilled rice balls brushed with miso - OMG - crispy exterior, perfectly cooked rice, really delicious - the server recommended it) (this was mine) Dessert: --green tea ice gream - perfection! came with a cute little sweet cracker thing. To drink: --1 sake (I don't remember which one... it was recommended by the server when we said "cheap and sweet" - $10 whatever it was) --1 sapporo! Highly recommended - enjoy!

I still don't know much about sake and this is still a favorite for my out of town visitors (see my previous rating). ?The only reason I'm docking a star is because I'm rescaling my ratings to reduce star-inflation. ?That said, Sakagura continues to capture my imagination but the food is not outstanding enough to retain 5-stars in my revised system. Be sure to try the steak on a stone (you cook steak pieces on a hot stone) and eggplant with miso.

Ok No Joke!!!! This place is the BEST BEST BEST Sake you will ever drink! BEST BEST Uni soup you will ever have!!!!although the uni soup could have been served warm not chilled....But still fantastico!!!! So went here for Xmas dinner last year with my best friend and her fam....about 8 of us! We had the blue bottle sake i'm sorry dunno what its called but it runs about $200 per bottle...I know i know really steep...but seriously soo soo soo worth it!!!! Never will you taste sake soo light, so refreshing...so utterly orgasmic!!!! want an orgasm from Sake go here!!! The UNI soup is chunks of uni in all it's glory with a perfectly poached egg sitting in a broth of miso seaweed and what tastes like ginger sesame soy a sauce....sooo ridiculously good....I never liked UNI until I had uni here!!! We also had a sashimi sampling: yellow tail, tuna, white tuna, fatty tuna, salmon, white fish, toro, octopus, ami ebi, tamago, various fish roes....all fresh and super delish!!!!! Ok heres the thing about this place; its inside the basement of some school! so if you aren't in the know about this place you shall never find or know about it....typically reservations are necessary...cuz it gets packed like a sardine can real easy! in the end ladies and gents: ?Go here for Food ORGASMS!!!!!

I've spent a lot of time in Tokyo, and this is the closest I've come to a Tokyo sake bar--outside of Tokyo. ?The experience of walking into the painted cinder-block basement of an office building to find a restaurant-oasis was just like back in Shinjuku. ?The sake list was amazing. ?The food was tasty--especially the grilled eggplant with different kinds of miso paste, but also the various preparations of tofu, pork dumplings, all sorts of snacks. ?Come here with time to graze and several friends so you can try a bunch of different things. By the way, I think this works for kids who are even a little bit adventurous. ?We brought two 9-year-old boys, and the great thing about having a lot of little plates of food on the table is that if they don't like one thing, they can move on to the next, and if they like that maybe we get a second plate for them. ?Our kids both tried things they never ate before and were proud of their efforts to try new things. ?We were seated in the corner so the minor chopstick/sword fight went unnoticed by the other patrons who were happily tasting/swilling their sake. ?I don't know if everyone would consider this a "kid's" restaurant--there was no one below 25 in the room besides our two guys-- but we made it work great!

If at first you don't succeed, try try again. After a failed attempt to walk-in at Sakagura a friend and I nabbed a Friday night res at their bar seats. Through a seemingly anonymous building lobby, past a dozing security guard, down some industrial stairs to the basement level you'll find fresh, inventive, and thoroughly delicious dining. The sashimi cuts were thick and tasty. Yellowtail, toro, and salmon. The seaweed salad includes 4 seaweeds and sesame dressing. I recommend it all! Agedashi tofu, fluke carpaccio with plum sauce, and pork and shrimp dumplings in thin beancurd wrapper. If there is such a thing as Japanese tapas, this is it. Another surprise, the bill was only $35 each. A bargain at twice the price.

If you are speaking of food, and food alone, this is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. Literally incredible. Everything is fresh, and the tastes just wow. I was literally blown away by this food. The Daikon radish with fish roe, amazing. The "Kamo Roast" the chilled duck, I mean literally one of the best things I've ever tasted, I'm salivating just thinking about it. The whole dinner was just so tasty and light, and perfect and I want to go back now. I would give it 6 starts if I could. It is a bit tricky to find you walk into a building, and sort of hang a left, there are no obvious directions....

This is definitely a "hidden gem" in Midtown. ?It's tucked away in a basement with NO reception, and the interior is amazing. ?I felt like I was in Tokyo. ?There's an overwhelming selection of sake (they give you an actual binder style menu to pick out of) and we ended up asking the server to help us out, and he picked well. ?You can order them in 1/2 bottles as well. ?He also recommended a great plum wine for my girlfiend and I... I wish I could remember the name because it was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy, plus with real plum pulp. ?The dishes come one at a time, but the timing is perfect. ?We ordered the seaweed salad with ginger dressing, beef tataki, mashed potatoes covered in sweet donut batter, beef tongue, pork belly, and kara age. (organic fried chicken) ?We also ordered the black sesame creme brulee and the pear millefuielle for dessert. ?I ENJOYED EVERY DISH... except for the pork belly because it wasn't what I expected... ?I've had better pork belly elsewhere. The service was on point throughout the night. ?Dishes were replaced, water and sake glasses were constantly refilled to the point where I didn't even notice that they refilled them! ?I would come back here again for a special occasion, but not for a regular meal because it was a little pricier than I expected.

This profusely decorated basement restaurant feels like a Japanese movie set and serves up authentic, tasty small dishes. The menu humbled me as I blindly picked out a handful of items to sample, leaving me feeling like a foreigner and wishing I did more "homework" on the offerings. ?Although my choices could have been more informed, everything was at least interesting and, at best, delicious. When you make a reservation, ask to be seated in the front of the restaurant; you won't regret it.

Sakagura is a thoroughly solid entry for izakaya (Japanese tapas) food. ?In Japan, maybe I would only give this a 4 star, since nothing reached above expectations and really surprised me. ?This is still the best izakaya I've been to in New York, though, and if you're new to izakaya food, you're really in for a treat. The entrance is distinctly hard to find, in the back of a nondescript high-rise that you take a flight of stairs or elevator down to. ?Once inside though, the interior space is marvelous. ?I also got a real kick out of the hidden bathrooms.

I just returned to Sakagura after a 2 year hiatus and I'm happy to say that I still like it. The food is intricate and unique... different than most Japanese restaurants in the city. The sake menu is ridiculously extensive, it can be very difficult to navigate through. Sakagura can be very pricey so unless you still run around with your corporate card, I do not recommend Sakagura for a big meal. Rather, it's a great place to experience different sakes and taste authentic tapas-style dishes. p.s. I love it that they are located in a very boring commercial building and you literally "discover" a world of sake. The ambiance is warm and their ladies' room is indeed super clean.

I wouldn't clear out a spot in my regular rotation for this restaurant but it's definitely worth it to try once. Bring a date who can drink and try all of their delicious sake! Stand outs where the black sesame creme brulee and the beef tongue. ?Their tofu is also incredibly fresh. ?The cold soba was touted as being hand made but it didn't look or have the texture of being. ?The custard with shrimp and pork was average. ?Grilled uni was very good.

Where better for a night out alone than to sit at a sushi bar, watching the bustle of the place around you? This hideaway basement restaurant really is more of Japanese tapas...there is very little sushi on the menu. There is, however, a sake menu at least as extensive as the dinner menu. I settled on a nama-zake (unpasteurized sake) tasting with three varieties. My favorite by far was: BORN DAIGINJO MUROKA from Fukui.It had a more complex flavor and nicer finish than the other two, though I enjoyed trying them all. Next time I'd probably just stick with the Born. I started with an eggplant dish from the specials. Pieces of eggplant scored to look much like pieces of fish, in a light broth and sprinkled with bonito flakes, so they even tasted of fish. Never had anything like it. Next up was maguro natto...fresh tuna sashimi served with fermented soy beans. The fish was wonderful and the soybeans were interesting with it, but the ratios seemed a bit off to my palate...I'd rather have a little less of the soybean to the tuna. If you haven't tried the fermented soybeans, they are a bit gooey. The sanma onigiri -- cooked rice balls with shiitake mushroom, pickled radish and mountain vegetables wrapped with baked pike mackerel were wonderful. The mushrooms and vegetables imparted such a savory taste to the rice to pair up with the smoky saltiness of the fish. I absolutely recommend these. They offer a number of varieties of rice balls. At the end of dinner, I was presented with green tea and a dessert menu and couldn't resist the recommendations from other Yelpers for the black sesame creme brulee. I enjoyed it a lot, though I think it would have worked better without the traditional caramelized sugar on top...it just didn't need the extra sweetness with the ice cream and the little wafer provided a nice crispiness. Service was friendly, attentive and unobtrusive throughout. I really recommend a visit to try something different.

Busy (even on a Monday night) but the sake selection (I had a staff recommendation, Hiroki, delicious) is worth a try and the food pairs drinks nicely. I second others when they say you should eat slowly for the sake of your wallet. The bar is a good place to have dinner at and the general noise level of the place is quite acceptable.

The location is cool and pretty hidden (just walk through the parking arage) As for dishes, the fluke and duck were the best dishes. The cold duck wrapped around scallions were amzing and extremely memorable (a must try).

I've ordered the lunch special every time I've gone, but the food has always been really good and the service is excellent. The soba lunch sets are generally pretty decent, but we've usually ordered the "Jewel" Oke Bento plus the Soba Gozens, even the taster set. Everything is fresh and delicious. I plan to go back next time for dinner because I am really curious about their dinner menu and their selection of sake (drinking during lunch is not the best work practice... so I try not to). I actually like their setting a lot. The place is hard as hell to find (in the basement of an office building next to a garage!?), so you won't find many random people there. Usually people know what they are in for. Also, I am very amused at the bathrooms. They're always fun to point out to people who're there the first time.

If you have big budget (like folks work for the UN) and want to impress someone, you will enjoy it. For me, I will never go back. Food is over priced for what it is, and portion is way too small. Re. Sake collection, I really don't think they have the best selection in town. I actually hosted a Japanese sake distributor's executive one night, and he also commented that it's over priced and hyped. He called this place "Japanese disney world in Manhattan". Oh, here's the funniest story, if you are a Japanese or have lived in Japan you will laugh so hard: We asked for umeboshi for our drinks, and when our bill comes we almost fell of the chair, they charged for umeboshis! What!? I never heard any Japanese bar charging umeboshi. We asked for manager but sure enough, they charge EVERYTHING at this place. That's so Americanized in my opinion. Sure they did really great job creating Japanese environment and I can see its good place to feel like Japan, but we aren't buying it. bye bye Sakagura, good luck ripping off from UN folks. Hahaha.

Came here on a Tuesday and ordered the Yakizakana Gozen, which consisted of grilled fish, spinach sesame salad, a bowl of rice, ?and hot soba noodles. The meal started off with the salad, and I would go there again just for that. It comes with a healthy sprinkle of sesame seeds, and the dressing tastes like the sesame oil/peanut mixture served with shabu shabu. It's a very tiny portion, so I might have to order an extra side on the next visit. While usually not a huge fan of soba noodles, the broth was mild and the noodles were cooked perfectly. A few more servings of this, and I might just become a true convert. The grilled fish was not overcooked, and it was just the right portion for a lunch that will not leave you comatose. Aside from the spinach salad the thing I most enjoyed was the ambiance. LOTS of Japanese office workers go here and it was pleasant to hear barely a word of English spoken.

It's authentic, but creative and definitely yummy. ? It's a little hard to find this place. It's tucked away in the basement of an office building. ?But once you get there...what a treat. ?They have great sake list that you can sample, and the food is delightful on the senses. ?We ordered a lot of food: Agedashi Tofu Onsen Tamago Tori Tsukune Shredded Beef Ribs Surimeika Yaki Saikoro Steak Grilled Japanese Eggplant Chawanmushi Tuna Sashimi Chocolate Souffle Coffee Jello All were amazing, this is a place that caters to an exotic palate. Next time I go back, I'll try the sake panna cotta. Get a reservation as the wait can be long, but this is definitely a place to try.

I have never seen such a wide selection of sake. The bathroom are unique. Got about 8 different plates of stuff I would never usually try, everything was pleasant although while reading the descriptions on the menu I was pretty put off. Don't get scared! Friendly staff who are also very helpful and knowledgeable. If you like big portions, this is not the place for you as everything is served on small plates and usually meant to be shared.

Hidden in the bowls of an anonymous midtown office building, this Japanese sake bar and restaurant has a peaceful ambiance. The entrance, in the building lobby, is unmarked save for a small gold sign pointing down a nondescript stairwell. The space inside is surprisingly large and minimally decorated with bamboo and rice paper. Although it feels more like a restaurant than a bar or lounge, the focus is very much on the sake. They've got reams of sake to go with the izakaya menu. They've also got some interesting desserts. Another one of the coveted places that make you forget you're in the middle of NYC.

Well, I was in NYC for a meeting and wanted to go somewhere "good", in the Midtown East area. So, I found this on Yelp and decided to give it a try! We found the location no problem, they have signs now and after reading the reviews here (thanks!), finding it was a piece of cake. I will say we were there for LUNCH, so I think that is the reason for this kind of a review. We got there at 11:50 and they gave us a coupon for either free soba, free drink or sake. ?What we didn't realize was that it's for our next visit...from 11:30-12:00 and it expires 8/31/08! ?So, anyone who wants it, let me know and I'll mail it to ya! ? First bad thing - the napkins smelled atrocious! ?Seriously, like they had used it to swab the gross stairs on the way down...they apologized and got us new napkins which were not offensive...not a great way to start off the meal. Then they tell us, they don't "do" sushi at lunch - another disappointment...I love to start off my meal with a handroll. ?Oh well. I ordered the special uni soba - I am a HUGE fan of uni. ?So for $16, I got 2 tiny slivers of uni with a bowl full of soba. ?Really? ?I realize this is NYC but the amount of uni was less than I would have gotten from one piece of uni sushi and they charged me $16? ?for that and a plate full of noodles? ?sigh...luckily I also ordered the tuna and avocado salad which was good but the avocados were bruised and the salad didn't have enough dressing. ?The tuna was good though... My co-worker got the sashimi lunch and he liked it but I would definitely have been hungry if I had eaten what he had. I ordered the house made dessert - I can't remember what it was called but it had red bean inside and it was a buckwheat pancake on the outside I think? ?So sort of like mochi but not sticky rice-y...it was okay. So, I think if I were a frequent NYC visitor, I would go, but for dinner so I could try the sushi and also sample the sake.

A great hidden gem! I was expecting a dark, dreary place but low and behold it was like I was in Japan. We came to have drinks. The sake was so smooth and tasted even better with the homemade dessert. The chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream is what I ordered - yum. I'd definitely go back to try lunch or dinner. The decor and atmosphere was fun yet had a homey feeling. Wonderful service.

Other than the drinks I can't fathom why someone would venture across the street from Yasuda to this place. ?The service is average at best (took our drinks without asking if we wanted refills), the food comes out slow (an hour for two appetizers and two mains that weren't much larger than the appetizers?), the menu is average in taste and presentation, and if not for the sake and beer I can't imagine I'd eve feel this good... I'm still bummed I didn't eat up stairs at the udon place and thank god I did eat across the street at Yasuda's to get the taste of Sakagura's out of my mouth.

I went there for lunch with three other people and right away we were seated. At first approach, the entrance looks deceiving because it's an office building but you have to just walk through the lobby and pass the security desk to the entrance right next to them. The minute you begin to descend the staircase you know you are approaching a Japanese restaurant because of the smell of raw fish. The ambiance was peaceful and no boisterous crowds. The service was very polite and no pretentiousness. I ordered the Sake itura Don which is salmon sashimi & Salmon roe on sushi rice with a full size of soba noodles on the side. The portions for the noodles and the rice are very much acceptable for the high lunch price of $16.50, however the quality is worth it. It was a special occasion for myself and my lunch mates so we were ok with the price. The rice bowl had a sprinkle of salmon roe and the black seaweed and there were three slices - yes I repeat 3 small slices of very fresh salmon sashimi. Although the fish provided was meager, you can't but help savor what you have received and that's what I noticed the whole table did because we ordered the same dish. The broth and the soba were exceptional! I enjoyed the entire broth. Even the tea was well made. There are some places where they pass off boiled water and reused tea leaves for green tea, but this tea you can taste the leaf and it was quite good as well as I didn't have to ask for the waitress to fill my cup, they were there making sure our cups were filled. I gave the place and overall 4 star rating because the quality of the food was good, I felt full because I ate up all the rice and noodle and drank the broth up. At $16.50 for my lunch, it was pricey but worth the experience and I would do it again, not for an everyday occurrence but more for when we feel like treating ourselves after bringing lunch in all week.

ANNOYING!!! Beware-This is NOT a sushi bar! Yelp or whoever the hell labeled it that way, FIX IT! Took my boy toy here for sushi because he was craving sushi, it had great ratings on Yelp, however it is labeled as a sushi bar. While they may have two things or so that are sashimi-like, the food here is small plate traditional Japanese entrees. We ordered three things, and my boy toy was so turned off (due to his pickiness of food), I ended up eating everything. He shared one of the specials with me which was a hot rock steak dish. I'm picky, but not as picky as he is, so I enjoyed the dishes. He about lost it when I informed him the buta kakuni was half pig fat. Funny on my end, but not on his...lol. Kudos for the sake selection. Awesome. Had a couple of carafes, and both were tasty. Incredible sake menu. The service was awesome and so was the restaurant itself.

Let's see if I can accurately recollect my experiences at Sakagura. ?Ok, so it is a hidden away in the basement of an office building, but that just adds to the ambience of the place. ?I've been lucky to have had three good dining experiences here (only for dinner though). ?I agree that it is a bit pricey but if you have a good reason to celebrate and kick back in a quiet, subdued and charming environment, then come to Sakagura. ?They have an extensive sake and drinks menu, though as a light weight, I couldn't really enjoy it all that much. ?I did try the plum-flavored sake, which was really sweet. ?The small plates are also quite good if you're open to sharing with your group. My memory's a bit hazy, but here's what I can remember trying: jidori shioyaki (chicken, a bit salty but good), chawanmushi (sucker for steamed egg filled with little treats), agedashi tofu (can't go wrong with this), onigiri rice balls (salmon toppings, just ok), soba noodles (refreshing!) and surumeika yaki (squid = yum). ?While I didn't have the opportunity to try everything, I made sure to take a stab at the dessert. ?I picked the black sesame creme brulee, which was amazing! ?I would come back again and be a little more adventurous with the sake selections.

I went here one night 2 and a half years ago, but I think some of the best food pics I've ever taken were taken on that night. ?The presentation of the food here is beautiful and you can tell that the people that make your dishes really put a lot of thought and care into delivering not only great food, but a fun experience for you. ?I sat at the bar and while I was eating, I could see how the desserts were being made and how detail-oriented they were at every step of the process! The food was amazing. ?The seared toro was the best I've ever had, the chawanmushi was delicious...The chicken nuggets had a garnish of lemon that was in the shape of a gazelle (something with two horns...)! ?I ended up spending a lot of money that night, but it was money well spent for a great experience and great pictures!!! Very highly recommended. ? In the basement of an office building near grand central station... make reservations and don't be late!

Reservations are impossible to come by at this place, so a friend and I thought we would take our chances on a Sunday night and just walk in. I had never been here before, so after being dropped off on 43rd and 3rd and wandering around a bit, I finally stumbled upon the building complex that Sakagura is located in. Walked down the shady looking stairs and...wow. A modern restaurant with simple yet elegant decor. Not at all the dark, dingy sake den I was imagining in my mind. We waited about 30 minutes for a seat at the "bar", which suited us just fine. This was around 7:30pm, would recommend going earlier, ~6pm for a shorter wait (I had called ahead and the wait at 6pm would have been only 10-15 minutes) Once we sat down, service was prompt, we ordered mugs of warm roasted green tea and began peering at all the intricate dishes on the menu. Each dish was very fresh and presented a variety of flavors while maintaining balance. Washed down with a cup of roasted Japanese green tea. Dishes ordered: Salmon Sashimi - 3 slices, extremely fresh, wasabi was the legit grated kind (not the usual out of a tube) Onsen Tamago - amazing small poached egg in a cold broth with sea urchin and salmon roe, definitely recommend for uni lovers Kamo - a play on traditional peking duck without the flour wrap. Sliced pieces of roast duck with scallions, meant to be eaten together. Cold, tender. You will like it if you like duck Agedashi Tofu - tasted the same as it usually does at other sushi places, nothing too special but I was craving it at the time Chawan Mushi - i can never resist steamed egg dishes and this one was a standout. Came in a little cup, an egg custard with a variety of delicacies buried inside, including chicken and shrimp Gyutan Yawaraka Ni - beef tongue. The largest dish out of everything we ordered. A solid 4 chunks of meat, extremely tender and flavorful. Definitely try this. Came in a warm broth with taro and mushrooms Buta Kukani - braised pork belly, sold by the piece. Tender, juicy, as you would expect pork belly to be. Desserts: Black Sesame Creme Brulee - delicious, light, not too sweet Earl Grey Tea Homemade Ice Cream - Perfect ending. Cold, cleanses the palate, not too sweet, came with a nice almond cookie Amazing meal overall, the two of us spent about $90 together - keep in mind we didn't have any sake - which was a steal for the gastronomic experience we had. ? Would definitely come over and over again to try everything else on the menu.

It is not exactly easy to define what Sakagura is. As its Japanese name suggested, their specialty is sake. It is an excellent sake bar that offers a wide range of premium quality sake. That is not the only thing Sakagura excels at. The food here is not shy at all in comparison to their sake selection. Lunch format is similar to a teishoku-ya, the focus is business set lunch. They also have a very competitively priced daily lunch special. Dinner format is izakaya style, mainly small dishes to go with your sake. I came here for lunch. Ordered the chef tasting lunch menu and yakizakana gozen (grilled fish lunch set). The preparation and presentation are very authentic. This place reminded me so much of Tokyo I almost forgot I was in the heart of NYC. The food was good. I was most impressed with their handmade soba. The texture is quite perfect. Both hot and cold style were excellent. Their tsukemono and sunomono (pickled/seasoned vegetable side dishes) are great as well. Their homemade desserts looked really amazing and I had a hard time picking. Black sesame creme brulee was my first choice but unfortunately they ran out that day. Ordered chocolate souffle and sake manju instead and was not disappointed. The souffle was one of the nicer ones I have had. The chocolate flavor is rich but not overly sweet. Sake Manju was lovely. Their homemade ice cream has good creamy texture but the sorbet is a bit too icy. The ambiance is quite formal. The restaurant definitely tailored towards the business crowd. Tables fill up really fast since this is a local's favorite. Reservation is almost a must. Lastly, do not expect to find sushi here just because it is a Japanese restaurant.

Oh man oh man oh man. This is one fantastic restaurant. I love sake and japanese food, and as good as the food was (no sushi except at lunch), the sake list is mind boggling - kind of like that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark at the end. Just imagine bottle upon bottle of sake to try. Ask your server for help - ours was a certified sake sommelier! The dinner we had was like going to a tapas bar, only all Japanese. The fish was fresh, the pork belly was incredibly tender; everything was really fantastic. An odd place, since you have to go to the basement of a non-descript office building to enter, but it is really a fantastic meal. I love Nobu for the sushi, but this place had none of the too-cool-for-you NYC crowd that Nobu always has. Highly, highly recommend it!

Yes they have a great sake selection but the food is still the best part esp their cooked food. ?Last time I went there we ordered the chicken meatballs, the ebi stick, the stewed beef and the fluke marinated in balsamic vinegar. ?Every dish had a great combination of flavors. ?I also liked the fact that they're small so you can sample a bit of everything. Ambiance is romantic and the service is unobtrusive and professional. ?Sit at the bar and you'll get to see desserts being taken out and prepared for guests which is quite fun.

My absolute favorite izakaya place in New York. Pricey yes, worth it definitely! I ate here as soon as I came back from my trip to Japan because I was in a state of depression that I was back in the dirty US. ?Great decision because Sakagura took me right back to Tokyo--business men drinking sake, dim lights, cute decor, Japanese speaking waiters, oh and yes, amazing food. The food is not too much of anything--except tasty. Very clean tasting and not sodium-laden like much Japanese restaurant food can get. This is a place to come with a small group, so everyone can share the small dishes and each enjoy a taste of Japan with each chopstick-full. The black sesame icecream dessert is to die for. I have been scouring the city for such deliciousness since dining at Sakagura...the only place that came remotely close was Cha-An in EV (for that specific dessert only). Other memorable dishes include the baked uni, hot stone beef, and the custard-like steamed egg [super authentic, tasted exactly like what I had in Japan]. Oh, and we had a delicious bottle of sake recommended by the waiter. Wish I could remember the name, but it is a small blue bottle meant for two and comes in a decorative little wooden basket.

Yes, it's true. This place is awesome. It's tucked away in the basement of a generic, midtown office building. But Sakagura has transformed the basement into a small traditional japanese village. Very classy, nothing cheesy. The Saki list: ridiculous. Dozens of pages, detailing hundreds of saki. The food: excellent as well. The dishes are small, so you should older 2-3 per person for sharing. Will definitely go back soon.

Myabe this review will end up being a little redundant given all the other reviews of this place, but I will say that Sakagura does a great job with ambiance but I found the menu to be a little redundant. Great dishes I had included the chilled roast duck, fluke carpaccio, roasted pork and black seasame creme brule Disappointments: the kimchi chirashi dish was super salty and the fish was looked and tasted like discarded leftovers from cutting up sushi and sashimi. The tuna with mountain yam was pretty flavorless and the service was extremely spotty. Our waitress left half way through the meal and wasn't ever replaced so we had to flag down several people to bring the check, take the check, and finally bring back the credit card bill. I would go back to try some of the other dishes but it's definitely not a must-go for me

What is it about "hidden" underground spots that make them so appealing ? It's that allure of the surreptitious speakeasy , being an insider I suppose. The sake selection is unbelievable to the point of being daunting actually. Opt for the Saturday or Sunday special or ask for guidance ! This isn't a "Sushi" spot stick to the Japanese tapas although the sashimi special was well rounded and fresh save for torro which we thought frozen. The bar is the best seat in the house as it distracts you from the fact that you are in a 1960's office building basement. It can get expensive here don't get all sake goggles and blow your whole paycheck-warning !

I liked that they have salmon sashimi and salmon roe over sea-weedy rice. That would have been the ultimate combo if the salmon roe didn't taste like they were soaked in sugar-water and the salmon sashimi actually tasted like raw salmon. Huh??? Was exactly what my brain said too. My friends ordered cooked items like fried chicken balls, fried potato balls, some kind of sauteed beef and more fried stuff which I sampled and deemed sadly mediocre. Not the items' names, so you know. Anyway, we all know Japanese places aren't known for their portions but COME ON PEEPS!! Shameless, shameless stuff. Anyway, the three stars are for the cultural atmosphere and the mini floral decorative on the table. Service was so-so, mediocre like the food-- borderline sucked. Didn't even bother with dessert.

After reading all the great reviews, I decided to give this restaurant a try, well.. bad choice.. The food was ok, but I have to say after having a $50 meal walking out the restaurant half full, then having diarrhea all night long was really a big big turn off for me. I do have a very sensitive stomach, but if the food were all fresh, I wouldn't had a reaction like that. Disappointed.

Really bad service for a mediocre food. The lady with short hair and eye glasses who took reservation was very rude and unfriendly. It makes me question the polite Japanese I usually encounter.

I was really looking forward to having dinner here with my beau while escaping one city for another, but unfortunately that wasn't so. ?Our waitress rushed us into ordering after coming over to us about 5 times within 5 minutes. ?Without any time to discuss what we would like to order to share a la family style, we blindly ordered uni over soba noodles w/uni broth (special for the evening), seaweed salad w/sesame dressing, maguro yamakake, jidori shioraki, buta kakuni and ended with the black sesame creme brulee. ?The uni soba noodles were fantastic, but then again, uni on anything makes it 500x better, even if it were ice cream. The other dishes were well prepared but didn't make me have a "when I'm back in NYC, I have to come back here" moment.

A great place to relax with some excellent food and drink. The place is a little hard to find, but definitely worth a search because of the great selection of food and sake. We ordered a plethora of dishes, but my favorites were the steak on the hot stone and the pork in the broth. Mmmm... yummy. I also liked the bathroom... I would never have figured it out if not for seeing someone walking out of it. Nice touch. One last suggestion - please remember to make reservations over the phone. The forward-thinker I am, I called to make a quick reservation before we all showed up for dinner at 8pm. By the time we arrived, we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table to clear. Otherwise, we would have to wait with the others for over 45 minutes for a table for four.

I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the uniqueness of the dining experience. If you take each individual plate by itself, I've had better dishes and it's probably a 4 star, but when you take into account the collection of Japanese dishes it makes for great dining experience. This is a place to go if you like different experiences and distinctive dining. ?If you're looking for a sushi joint with rolls named after local landmarks this isn't the place for you. I think a good metric to determine whether you'll really like this place or not is: Do you think Uni is an exotic dish? If yes you might not like this place, if no then you'll really like this place.

Went here a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend. We were lucky enough to get last minute reservations. The food was amazing! The number one thing I look for in a restaurant is if their staff matches the ethnicity of the food they're trying to portray. EVERYTHING is JAPANESE here! The restaurant has a huge selection of sake. You know the restaurant is good if you see Japanese businessmen there. The menu is pretty authentic. Mostly small dishes and no real entrees. We ordered the seasonal sashimi selection and OMG it had the best uni I've ever had in my life. The uni was wayyy better than the uni at Sushi Yasuda. WAY BETTER. But you don't really go to Sakagura for the sushi, you go for everything else. I can't remember everything we ordered but our table was not big enough. I highly recommend this place. Don't forget to finish off with the black sesame brulee. It's delicious. I'm a fan of all things sesame.

My friends and I went for a going away/birthday party and it was amazing. The wait staff was very attentive, we ordered a bunch of dishes and they would serve them to us once at a time so we weren't cluttered with dishes. The chicken teriyaki meatballs were divine. Moist and tender with a wonderful sauce. The chef's special of the stewed pork was delectably tender and flavorful. The ebi stick was crunchy and delicious. The fried mashed potato dipped donut batter was fried to perfection but didn't taste much like potato, imo. Tasted mostly of the batter. The fried chicken marinated in sake and ginger was ok. The filet mignon on hot stone was fun and delicious! The miso yakionigiri was orgasmic, as a friend described it. And last but not least, dessert. For dessert we had the chocolate souffle which was amazing. It was light and went beautifully with the vanilla ice cream and the raspberry sauce. All in all, it was a great experience and I'd definitely like to go back.

I feel that Sakagura is more western-oriented than traditional ones. The food here is really mediocre even for an izakaya, and lacks variety. Sake is their strong suit, but how can i enjoy good sake with so-so food? Ambiance and decor also leans onto the modern, or fusion side, which i hate. But it seems NYC lacks decent izakayas so this one is probably the best you can get.

My girlfriend and I came here for dinner last weekend. It can be a little hard to find right off - you have to walk into a building entrance first and then go down the stairs into the basement. We had to wait about 5 minutes after the specified 6 PM opening time until they actually popped it open, but they've done a very nice job with the ambiance despite the underground location. We got seated reasonably quickly, although I question why it was so hard to get a reservation...even by the time we had left, the place still seemed roughly half-empty. Service was decent - nothing fantastic, but the food came out quickly. As for the food itself: everything we had was delicious, but I wouldn't put it above Momokawa, which is my current favorite spot for all-around traditional Japanese food. To be fair, the sake menu here is prodigiously large, but not being a big sake drinker, I can't really pass judgment on it. The dishes were all delicious, with the highlights being the deep-fried curried pork - the flavor was fantastic, and the curry added a nice little hint of space to what would ordinarily be a relatively plain dish. The beef cooked on the stone was a cool experience, and it was very tender - but not as flavorful as I would've imagined, and probably not worth the $20 given the amount of meat (it's more for the experience). The other noteworthy dish was the uzaku - the eel was very fresh and paired very well with the lightly dressed veggies. Dessert was amazing - even though I've been to other restaurants (ahem, Max Brenner's) that have more of a focus on chocolate, the souffle here was fantastic - the perfect consistency without being too light or too cake-y. The creme brulee with black sesame ice cream was a very unique taste on its own, but it tasted amazing. All in all, I'd definitely come back here again. I wouldn't call it my top choice for true Japanese food, but they do have a wide selection of very, very good food. A fantastic place to dine for sure!

I just went to Japan this summer and fell in love with it -- when Manhattan gets overwhelming, Sakagura is my secret getaway, like a portal back into some hidden Kyoto izakaya. ?But it's no good hiding it, because despite its basement quarters, the secret is obviously out about Sakagura -- all I can do is add to the chorus of fans. ? In 3 visits, I haven't had a single disappointment from the menu, but some of my favorites are: - the salmon/ikura donburi -- salmon sashimi and ikura on rice. ?it sounds so simple, but it's so sublime. ?Their ikura are super-fresh and somehow more savory than your usual run-of-the-mill ikura, and the rice is fluffy perfection. - beef grilled on a hot stone -- again, simple, but so much fun - black sesame creme brulee -- heaven in a ramekin. ?the black sesame is freshly ground, the creme brulee is perfectly executed, and they make their own black sesame ice-cream as a topping (toasty black sesame paste swirled into vanilla ice-cream, which gives it more punch) All this bliss doesn't come cheap -- dinner there runs around $90 for two people (without drinks -- and their sake menu is so extensive that you may find it hard to resist temptation). ?But their lunch menu is huge (if not quite as extensive); I had an excellent set lunch there for $15, and it was so much food I couldn't finish it and barely needed to eat dinner.

My favorite casual Japanese place in the city, by far. I have come here multiple times and have never had a bad experience. They put so much thought into every dish and while the food is delicious, it isn't heavy at all. Amazing selection of unique and authentic dishes, won't burn a hole in your wallet, and they even grate their own wasabi. You can tell the wasabi doesn't come out of a tube because it is super fresh and kind of grainy. This place is legit. It's also one of the few nicer japanese restaurants that are open on Sundays (Why is this, btw?). ?In addition, while the entryway to the restaurant is super sketchy (pass through a lobby of some parking garage then go down two flights of stairs with bleak whitewashed stone walls), the interior is super cute and traditional, with bamboo altars and tables, empty rice tubs and sake jugs lining warmly-lit shelves. Very intimate and inviting. One of those places where you can talk with a friend for over 3 hours as the server comes out with beautiful dishes one after the other. Some of my favorites: - Beef tongue with daikon - Onsen tamago - soft-boiled egg with sea urchin and roe (This combo of sea urchin with roe and a third ingredient of the mushy variety, i.e. egg, oyster, tofu, etc. is my current OBSESSION, btw.) - spicy grilled codfish - Sakagura special - pork belly - Grilled japanese eggplans in 3 types of miso - Earl grey ice cream - black sesame ice cream with black sesame creme br?lée Need to get some sake next time I come, since they're very well-known for their selection.

Sakagura is in a basement but the decor and the nice setting of the restaurant are good enough to make you forget that you are actually in a basement. ?It is considered quite a large space with many seating. ?Overall I would say that the setting and ambience of this place far exceed the price and tastiness of the food itself. It is a good place to have a meal with your colleagues or friends BUT if you are really seeking out for real, quality Jap food, this place is considered AVERAGE. ?But it is still a nice place and I will come back for the overall package.

Sakagura serves real Japanese food - the way the Japanese have it. ?The cooks really care about what they serve there and it's easy to tell. ?No tricky gimmicks to attract the more naive crowd. ?Just authentic Japanese food. Almost any dish here is worth trying. People who don't like the food here just don't get it - they should stick to fast food; save the Japanese caviar for those who know.

The hallmark of a 5-star Yelp restaurant, I think, often lies in the fact that everything about the restaurant is consistently great. It's so easy sometimes to rest on good word-of-mouth, and I have unfortunately seen many restaurants fall off in quality over the years. But not so with Sakagura. The service is impeccably polite. The food is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach. The decor transports you from the basement of a midtown building all the way to Japan. There are almost too many things to order off the menu. Thinly sliced duck garnished with scallions, a refreshing salad of shaved radish and roe mayonnaise, and a fun interpretation of tuna tartar topped with two types of roe are among my favorite dishes. It is so much fun to order a wealth of little dishes to share, and for the drinkers, there's a myriad of sake choices to mix and match as well. I don't come here often, maybe once or twice a year. But every time I go, I leave full and contentedly happy.

This place is good. ?They have a vast selection of special Japanese dishes, and they're almost all prepared very well. ?I was a little disappointed with the rice balls I ordered, because I'm used to getting them grilled and crispy on the outside, but Sakagura's are just simple balls of white rice, which seems kind of pointless. ? Overall, this is a decent place if you're looking for a Japanese restaurant with lots of grilled, braised, fried, etc. dishes as opposed to the many sushi places in the area. ?However, I do think Aburiya Kinnosuke nearby is superior.

I'll start with dessert first. I read reviews before I came here, and so it was a very very good choice to go with the black sesame creme brulee. So, so delicious and unique, had the right consistency, and wasn't too sweet. I would definitely recommend it! The pear ice cream was ok, I enjoyed it, but would recommend the black sesame creme brulee :) As for the entree, we ordered the soft crab with rice that comes in a clay pot (for two people) and I have to say that it was quite disappointing. I was actually really looking forward to it, especially since the waitress said it has become a more and more popular choice among customers. The crab was soft and tender, but there was too much rice that was mixed into it which made my experience here only 3 stars

My friend and I went there for their Natsumatsuri festival and I must say we were impressed by the food and the service. The food portion was small but still decent for the price because even though it was not that big, it can still fill you up and the quality of the food is exceptional. They also have a wide variety of sake and they gladly assist you in choosing your preference. We ordered the Sanma Onigiri and Sake Oyako Don, and both were very tasty and filling. Service is fast and the wait staff is very courteous and accommodating. A japanese friend also recommended this restaurant, which was another reason why we went. This japanese place could be a little pricey but if you are going for quality and authenticity, Sakagura is highly recommended.

First, find the place. ? It's next to another Japanese restaurant, which we thought was actually the place. ?You go in a regular office building, check with the security guard, and find it's in the basement. ?You almost think it's a hidden jewel, but when we went the place was very busy. I would highly recommend that you have had or are very familiar with traditional Japanese cuisine before booking a reservation. ?This is not ?a sushi joint, although they do offer sashimi. ? The menu is not large, but the drink menu is. ?I recommend the plum wine and soda - not too sweet, very palatable. In terms of food - the style is to order portions over the course of your 2-hour or so reservation and just pass things around the table as the conversation and time goes by. ?It's not like you order a main dish, eat and go. There were a couple dishes that my meat and potatoes palate were not too excited about - but again - it's traditional cuisine, so get used to it or don't go. And if you like traditional, and you've been to Japan, you will most certainly feel authenticity and find this place a great spot to come back to often. Oh yeah, the prices were fine. ?We left paying 200 for a party of four and everyone was full.

Hands down the best place to go in NYC! ?I stop by here every time I visit NYC. ?I love the ambiance, service, and the high quality of their food. ?They have so many sake choices that I was more than happy when the wait staff offered to recommend a few options. ? Be ready to drop some $$$ when you come here, but you will not regret it! ?They also have a great lunch menu that is a lot cheaper than their dinner. ?Their soba is made in-house and you can really taste the difference. ?I love the cold soba.

Very Japanese feeling restaurant hidden in the basement of a way east side office building, in a street full of car rental garages. ? Lots of interesting small plates - e.g.mackerel wrapped rice balls were delicious; and some ordinary ones, like edamame, were unusually good. They have an enormous sake list. ? I would definitely return

Food: This meal was a bountiful fount of food orgasms. As a previous reviewer wrote, just tell your server (we sat at the bar so I'm not sure if this option is available at a table) "omakase" along with some general preferences and you'll be treated to a fantastic dining experience. My friend and I had whitefish with ponzu sauce, eggplant, seared kobe steak, codfish, steak on a hot rock, udon noodles, a chocolate souffle, and a coffee jello for about $65 a person. Pricey, but reasonable for the quality of food. Service: Very good. The server was polite and accommodating, though he was sometimes hard to understand and needed me to repeat what I was saying a couple of times. Other than that the food arrived quickly and our tea and water was refilled automatically. I also would recommend making a reservation at least a few days in advance -- I believe I got lucky calling in just the night before. Other factors that push this restaurant from 4 stars to 5 are its ambience (beautiful decor) and presentation of food. I can't wait to work up enough cash to come here again.

OH HELL TO THE NO! I was starving by the time I walked in here, but I was aware it was sort of a Japanese tapas type of restaurant. When I got the menu...I must have scanned it for 20minutes, I could not find anything that sounded appealing to me. Perhaps this was the wrong restaurant for me to venture in as I do not eat sashimi. But at least have some interesting cooked dishes....is that so much to ask? Anyway, I ended up with the fried potato balls, which were a complete miss. I felt like I could have gotten this at a chinese bakery and have it taste better. It was too much dough, not enough mashed potatoes inside. Also had the fried pork strips--DISGUSTING! It was oozing in this sort of sweet grease and had a weird texture and taste to it. If they were trying to be unique, they failed. We also ordered their grilled steak cubes, which was pretty much overcooked steak drowned in ginger sesame dressing. RIPOFF!

Fun sake bar. Very nice decor. Located underground- no windows, but you won't miss that. It feels very authentic to me (I have been to Tokyo - but only for a few days- so I am not an expert but it reminds me of places in Tokyo that I had seen and been to). The food is very authentic and if you are a picky eater it is best to maybe see if you could see a menu first - or just go there to drink sake! The food is fun but adventurous for a person used to the more typical sushi restaurants (i.e. 7/8 pieces of sushi and a tuna roll for a typical dish). The same owners own Decibel downtown for the grungier version of this place. Since I moved to Nassau County it has been a while since I have been back to either- but thinking I should get there at some point again soon! :)

awesomely hidden and delicious. i definitely didn't expect to find an authentic japanese oasis in the bowels of an office building, but was pleasantly surprised. so much of NY is subterranean, which i'm still getting used to. anyways, i met up with a coworker and we ordered a few items. also, just a note that the bill was probably pretty hefty but i left feeling about 80% full. small portions but cooked well. - beef that you grill yourself on a little stone: it was good, better after i realized rare was the way to go. it wasn't spectacular though. - fresh sashimi combination: incredibly fresh. i only recognized uni and hamachi, but everything was good. - eggplant: decent. eggplant doesn't wow me but this was quite tasty. - uni soba noodles: my favorite! i'm a sucker for anything uni, so i really enjoyed this. add some seaweed and a dash of grated real wasabi and it was perfect. i would definitely come back! but not before i explore everything else NY has to offer.

I was a bit late (10 min) for the reservation because I was outside of plain midtown builing waiting for my friends, texting and calling but no replies. I decided to just go down but the basement looked a bit too much like a boiler room.... No wonder no phone receptions... But walking in, I see my party still waiting for the table and some lively steaming food scenes going on and stomach awakening aromas kicked my nostrils. Suddenly the hostess asked for my coat to check and apologized for our wait. It was packed but her apology and the immediate well-manner made up for it. The place is dimly lit but cozy. I like the Chrysanthemum flower arrangemenet on our table. The whole place is colored like bamboo and brown rice papers - even the flowers. ?The menu books were nicely hard covered and thick. I like the fact that the sake menu had a map of Japan with name of regions written so that we can relate with where the sakes are from since the sakes are mostly categorized by the regions. We had some sparkling unfiltered wine as a starter but I was not so fond of it. it was a bit felt like 3 layered notes than balanced. There was one of sakes that I was just wanting to try. it was listed in limited edition page decribed to have baked apple note. We got to taste before we buy the bottle($82) and we all absolutely loved it. ?But the waiter came back and said that the last bottle has been just used. arhhhhhhh.......... ?From then on, we were constantly suggested to try different sakes until we found our choice. All the staffs are Japanese and seemed natives as well. They were knowledgeable about sakes, not to mention having some pride in the culture. ? Foodwise, it certainly was home-cooking. Mostly I feel dishes were mildly seasoned but so fragrant and well balanced. I personally think that it is their seasoning soy sauce/vinegar. They probably had their own soy sauce but vinegretted. It means it is not from Kikoman bottle... LOL Korean call this "Jang-Maht" literally meaning - Soy Sauce Taste where the food of the house or place depends on soy sauce of the house since traditionally every home brew their own soy sauce/vinegar in Asia. For example, the grilled Eel came with pickled fresh cucumber slices and also marinated with seaweed and cucumber sliced.. the marination was simple, the vinegretted soy sauce or some aged vinegrette. I could taste this sauce in many other dishes. I assume that the soy sauce or vinegrette is from aged pickled juice - Korean called this "Jang-Ah-Chi", which such as garlic, plum/apricot (Umeboshi), Dai-kon and etc get pickled in the mixture of simmered and cooled down water, soy sauce. vinegar and sugar or syrup. Therefore, even without much addition, the whole dish has mysterious savoriness and is whole. I love love this cucumber slices and it cleanses your mouth between dishes very well but also it mixes very well with sakes. Apparently, my appetite went skyrocked and I went to Asian market(Han-Ah-Reum) to buy some garlic Jang-Ah-Chi ($2.99) today. The first dish was scallop sashimi with mango sauce but the mango sauce was so rich that almost tasted like Uni(Sea Urchin). The tuna tartare was excellent and I could not stop eating wanting more, not to mention the beautiful plating. I wasn't so crazy about the pork Shu-mai which was A OK. Grilled Black Cod got high marks on the texture. The dessert, the black sesame creme buree was the star. The puree was very creamy and delicious not being overly rich goes so well with the ice cream - oh so heavenly. However, Nah for the sea salt chocholate. It was way to salty and the salty kicks were so intense even to the degree of surprise. Since we had tried so many sakes before we made our choice (trials were only 6 sakes!!) top of our two bottles, we got all very tipsy. One of our tipsy friend went to the bathroom and came back so excited with the bidet buttons. I am sure he must had some good time in there playing with it. hahaha All nicely food and wined, each spent about $70 each. The hostess already grabbed my coat, waiting to help me put on while I was hehe with my friends a little buzzed. Good life, good food - I promised them that I would be back soon.

There is so many ways I could write about it and tell you how good it was that I don't know if to focus in the sake, the food or the ambiance since each one can overpass the other. Located in an area with probably the highest 4-5 Yelp-rates concentration don't be tempted to go into Soba Totto or Sushi Yasuda just because its easier to see it; I know, it's right next door and it worth a visit for sure, I'll tell you soon, but you can't miss Sakagura. This time you will need to remember this: 211E Basement #1... Basement.. very important You can breath the ambiance of beautiful clandestinity at the first step. Traditional Japanese decor full of what we all like; noren, bamboo, plants, bright and with an impressive bar decorated with sake bottles all kinds over a shelf covering the wall. Nigori is the sake that I most like, is unfiltered sake resulting in a cloudy drink, the sweatiest, where sometimes you can even taste the rice grains already powdered.. I guess I'm that rustic compare with my friends. Attending my wishes but pleasuring everyone, we order sparkling Nigori.. First time I hear about it; a dark green bottle filled with Sake in 2 separate phases, aqueous in the half top and a milky solution, formed for the rice residues, in the half bottom. Delicately mixed for our "sake server" ?the bottom cloud slowly fused and dominate the aqueous part becoming a uniform white pale liquid served in flute type glasses. It wasn't that rustic at all, right?. The perfect food pairing this sake was suggested in the menu and so we order the Scallop sashimi with mango vinaigrette, a mayonnaise type sauce very tasty that I didn't like. Just personal preferences, tho. But I swear the scallops worth the time I spent draining out the sauce, either in flavor and texture, melting in our mouth in a way that I can't believe it was meat. ? It takes some time to decide our next Sake round. We decided finally the one that Sakagura just run out that night; it was a limited edition.. among 200 that they have.. great :/ . We were already in love with that Sake; forget about it was impossible; replace it takes a while, "2 sake servers", that take it as a challenge, and at least 6 sake shots (maybe more?) until we taste one that satisfied all of us. Most of them was excellent, tho. In the mean time, food was coming, Food that also takes some time to order.. since the menu is not that little and everything sounds amazing. A Maguro Tartar, an Uzaku, a Gindara yuan yak (grilled cod in special soy sauce), a Gyu Miso Nikomi (Shredded Beef Back Ribs stewed in Miso), ?a Chawanmushi (Steamed Egg Custard) a Yuba shumai (Minced Pork Dumpling) and another half bottle of sake later (plus the shots) we were so happy that we even didn't care about the fact that they forget the tofu that I ordered. They just annulled the order and we were ready for the dessert. Let me say that I loved all the dishes. But that the Uzaku, which is Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed and the Maguro tartar, Tuna with yuzu-steeped roe & caviar served over a bed of cucumber slices, juts take my breath away. For dessert we order Black sesame cream brulee and Sea Salt Chocolate ice cream.. as good as it sounds. The cream brulee was as good as the one you get at Cha An and about the sea salt chocolate ice cream, ?you have to like "weird" chocolate. I tasted it before; sea salt truffles are one of my faves; this one was very well balanced with just a touch of salt To finish this history just 2 things remain to be said, - Atif I, you was right - and.. ?why not a five? well... 5 means being perfect and among others small things, there was for me 2 main imperfections at Sakagura: 20 min waiting to be seated (even we arrived on time) and that they didn't realize before that our beloved sake was run out However, don't tell anyone else, but I'm not always demanding perfection

This past Monday, my college buddy and I ended up at Sakagura after we couldn't get reservations at Nobu (at a decent hour) and Paper Moon.. was apparently no more - both places I've never been to. A lot of effort just to eat.. however our back up back up plan, Sakagura, turned out to be a real gem. Sakagura is hidden in the depths of a non-descript office building off 43rd St., a short jaunt from work. Upon first entrance, you start off by walking down a brightly lit white corridor, turn the corner through some seemingly random door, down a flight of sketchy stairs, and enter magnificent Sakagura. First thing my friend told me, "Hey, check out the bathrooms". Uh.. ok. They're shaped like large wooden sake fermentation vats! Seriously, if the bathrooms are inspired by sake, you know they're not playing around. The restaurant is gorgeous. It was like running through a forest and stumbling into the secret village of the elves in the most unlikely place. Tables are set inside wooden building facades, as if you are looking down an old village neighborhood. At the center, a long sake bar decked out in sake you haven't even dreamed of yet. We were seated immediately. Our hostess was quite friendly and chatty. The extensive sake list was a bit overwhelming, largely because it was very detailed and much of it written in Japanese. It took us awhile to figure out the various menus. I must admit, in the end, my friend chatted directly with the waitress in Japanese and ordered everything for us. My only input, "Go for it. I'll try anything".. famous last words? For drinks, my friend had the plum wine. It was golden and tasted sweet, almost like a muscadel. I had a tasting sake sampler which featured two super premium and one regular sake shots set on a little tray. You could really note the stark changes in smoothness and taste between the three tastings. As for the food, I can only describe. The first dish was spinach with sesame and a little brown sugar. Honestly, the sesame and brown sugar reminded me of a Korean songpyun, only with spinach. The waitress brought out a salad of lettuce, tomatoes, and soft tofu next. It seemed more like a palate cleanser. There wasn't much flavor going on, even with the dressing. Next up, chicken! Fried to Japanese perfection that is. The skin was crisp and a rich tawny brown color. The flesh was warm and succulent. One of my favorites. Then on the waitress' recommendation, we had shrimp wrapped in fried flour skins (mandu wrap?). The dipping sauce seemed to consist of miso sauce with a little hot pepper paste mixed in. Warm and crispy with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. Definitely can't go wrong there. Our shrimp wraps were followed up with a bowl of sweet sauce. In the middle, a piece of pork sat marinating, the meat and fat still clinging together in a delicate little square. The rich fat imbued the whole dish, but didn't leave a greasy film upon tasting. It was a little sweet and a lot savory with the meat falling apart with the slightest effort. As a finale, the waitress brought a tuna tartar, half covered in cavier and the other half flying fish roe with yuzu. The tuna was fresh and clean tasting. I expected the cavier to make the dish a bit salty, but it wasn't at all. The yuzu I couldn't really taste until I let the flying fish roe roll around my tongue a bit and then the citrus taste just popped in a bold way that said "Hey! I was here the entire time". Dessert: We ordered two, a Black Sesame Creme Brulee served with ice cream and a black sesame wafer and a Chocolate Souffle' served with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. The Chocolate Souffle' was hot to the touch and steamed when the spoon broke through the decadent, chocolately surface. Rich, vibrant, chocolate! The ice cream was a great balance, cool and calming. As for the Creme Brulee, I've never met a creme brulee I didn't like. The black sesame was an interesting take. A more modest sweetness with a sugary crunchiness. Very good. Overall, the food was a bit sweeter than normal from what I understand. Still, it was pretty good and each dish was beautifully presented. Just like when wandering into a fairy tale village, it is quite easy to lose track of time in underground Sakagura. We started dinner at 7:30pm and I still ended up missing my 1am bus back home. (I hate it when I do that..) But, there's an intangible comfort in talking and catching up with an old friend at a place like Sakagura. review 4/17/2008 I.M.Y.

Sakagura is located in the basement of an obscure office building. ?We never would've discovered the place if we didn't see the sign outside. ?We walked in on a whim the first time on a Saturday night, but were turned away since we didn't have reservations. ?So if you want to dine here on Friday or Saturday night make sure you make reservations well in advance. We order the steamed egg, grilled tile fish and cod, chilled roast duck to start. ?I would definitely recommend the steamed egg, tile fish, and roast duck. I wasn't a big fan of the cod, it was a bit too salty and thought the one at zenkichi is much better. ?We also got the steamed rice cooked with snow crab meat from the menu of recommended dishes. ?It came in a cute stone pot and was so delicious. ?Then came the desserts. We got Chocolate souffle and the pear millefeuille. ?The pear millefuille came with earl gray ice cream. ?It was a great way to end the meal

Who knew that there is a gem of a place who's entrance is hidden among the corridors of a nondescript building? ?If it weren't for a sign outside you would never be able to tell it's there at all. ?The doorway leads you to a plain stairway that goes straight down the basement and into what seems like a totally different world. ?Once through the door downstairs the place sudden morphs into a what feels like a Japanese village/restaurant. ?They even had a freakin mini village gate entrance by the door going into the dining area. Awesome!!!! ? http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The menu is a clusterf%#k of ?a lot of items to choose from so be prepared to stare at it for a long time trying to figure out what to order if it's your first time here. Hell, I think I became cross eyed from looking at the menu for so long. ?To me the menu could have been organized in a more comprehensible manner because there was no clearly defined appetizers, small plates, and entrees. ?Took our group of 6 more than a few moments to figure out what to get. ?I have to admit the server was more than patient with us whenever he came back time after time and we said we weren't ready yet. ?After awhile I just kind of gave up and ordered whatever sounded exotic or interesting (with a bit of ini mini miny moe thrown in for good measure). ?I ended up eating: Appetizer: UZAKU : Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed. ?This was so delicious. ?The vinaigrette brings a nice sharp sour bite to the ingredients while the wakame salad brings a snap and a crunchiness to the dish when eaten together with the eel and cucumber. ?5 stars ? ? ?http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Entree: Can't find the name online but it's a special menu item with slices of raw steak that comes with a very hot rounded stone. ?You place the steaks on the stone yourself and it cooks the meat to your liking. ?Kind of like a BBQ grill... but with a rock. ?How cool is that? ?Anyway, I think they gave me a defective rock ( Time to call mother nature for a refund ) because halfway through cooking my steaks, it started to fizzle and barely cooked the meat. ?Another dining companion that ordered the same dish had it sizzling and steaming till the very end. ?I had to borrow his stone to finish the rest of my steaks ?=/ ? ? It tasted good (but kind of ordinary since it's basically grilled steak meat) with the accompanying soy sauce based dipping sauce. ?I think it's more for the experience which is kind of fun and entertaining. 4 stars. ? http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ? http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Dessert: CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with Vanilla Ice Cream & Raspberry Sauce: ?The souffle was incredibly soft and light. ?The raspberry sauce comes in a separate glass cup that you pour over the ice cream and souffle to your own taste. ?The ice cream was good but nothing too special taste wise considering it's just vanilla flavored. ?The raspberry sauce gives it a nice sweetness to it. ?4.5 stars ?http://www.yelp.com/biz_… We all tasted each others dishes but since there was 6 of us and most of us ordered 3 dishes each, there is simply too many dishes for me to mention all of them in this review. There is two I do want to tell everyone about though. (1)BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream. ?Many reviewers recommends this dessert and for good reason. ?Yummy!!! ? ? http://www.yelp.com/biz_… (2)JAGA DANGO : Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp. ?Very few reviewers talks about or recommends this dish and for good reason. ?It's doughy and kind of tasteless. ?Boring!!! One last thing to mention. ?Most of the portion size are pretty tiny so if you are really hungry that day, avoid this place ( My 19 dollar steak entree came only with 6 small slices of meat). ? Either that or be prepared to buy a lot of dishes in order to fill your tummy. ?The rice dishes and the noodle dishes seems to be the best value size wise for dinner time. ?I would give the place a 5 but I left the place still hungry after spending a little over 40 bucks for myself from this meal. ? Then again I tend to eat a lot so maybe I'm not the best judge of portion sizes =)

I went here about 5 years ago and loved it but forgot about it. Recently, I read about it and decided to go again. Wow, great food- Like Japanese tapas. The sake selection is awesome. We dropped some coin on a $215 bottle. Best sake I ever had. We had a lot of different food- pork meatballs, cod in soy sauce, Tuna sashimi, edamame, squid grilled with soy sauce and more. All excellent. Great service and cool ambience

You'd think that midtown east, what with it's lavish New American power lunch/dinner institutions, wouldn't be able to sustain an eclectic place like Sakagura, but it does! I chose this restaurant because I have a friend on the UES, and I'm in Hells Kitchen, so this is our ideal meeting place. Additionally, Sakagura has a lot of pescatarian options, which is a requirement for my kosher dining partner. You should also know that this place is in the basement of an office building, and that there is another Japanese restaurant next door, so meeting up can be confusing because one is inclined to step into the Japanese store-front next door. Sakagura in all it's saki-induced splendor is through a neon-lit lobby, past the front desk, and down a flight of service stairs. You are then greeted by a MASSIVE dimly-lit basement with large wooden dining enclaves, cherry blossoms and fusuma (paper japanese doors). The juxtaposition of office to saki den is enough to make a visit worthwhile. For dinner we shared a few of the all-tapas menu including Maguro Tartar (chopped tuna with frying fish roe steeped in yuzu and caviar) and hirame ponzu (Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette). All was lite and refreshing and well-executed.

This place is special in more ways than one. A foodie friend in the know brought us here after a birthday dinner ringing in his 28th. I had never heard of Saka-Gura before so this was a new experience for me. I liked that we had to enter a hybrid residential/commercial-like building and walk down a flight of stairs to enter this dark and dungeony oasis of booths, and four-tops seated with Japanese food aficionados. I felt like I was in on a very special little secret. Between the three of us, we shared 4 desserts (there is always room for dessert!).. I'll start from fair to outstanding. First, was the Japanese coffee dessert which had the consistency of jello, and a strong coffee aroma that progressively developed. This was not quite my favorite but my friends thought it was fair/good. Then there was the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. Oh my was this delicious. All three of us loved the prominent but not overpowering black sesame in each spoonful of this dessert. It could have gone very badly, as in, an extremely bitter taste had too much black sesame been added, but this was perfectly made. The piece(s) de resistance were certainly the truffles. Without question, the green tea was the best. These tiny morsels were a paradoxical treat. Creamy and sumptuous, thick and flavorful, but surprisingly light. We had ordered a plate and loved it so much that our 4th dessert followed suit. The only exception, which was a mistake, was that we ordered the black sesame flavored truffles and they utterly paled in comparison to the glorious green tea. Here, the black sesame went a bit overboard and a bitter aftertaste resulted in an unkind dessert. They were spiked with sake but it just didn't seem to work. I tasted a vinegary truffle that did nothing for me but force me to rebuke the thought of ever ordering them again. The three of us agreed to stick to the green tea truffle for future reference. This place is cozy and I'd love to come back for more than just their dessert. The menu seemed extensive and friends have suggested some of their signature dishes.

s avory mini izayaki style ?bar a dorable, accentual, alluring mood is perfect for k indling your lost love, friendship, and any relationships. a esthetically pleasant wait staff and decor will be heightened by sake consumption g o and see it for yourself u ?must when you are in town r ead the other reviews and you'll see a ssured by yours truly. ------ Try the kamo roast negimaki (slices of chilled roasted duck topped with scallions and basil sauce). Must try the buta kakuni (stewed diced pork belly) Recommend but not highly recommend the gindara yuan yaki (grilled cod fish). it was salty and little too smoked grilled style for me. i like my fish fatty and buttery. Must be in the right mood to have inaniwa udon noodle from akita with spinach. It's rather ?plain but the clear broth is unexpectedly tasteful. by the way, don't expect fat thick udon noodles. the noodles are thinner than soba noodles and soft. it's simply delightful but not extraordinary. we need sakagura in la. i miss it... i miss it alot.

what an experience! this is the sister restaurant of Decibel (in East Village)- another hidden treasure in a non-obvious location. you will not even notice the entrance unless you look closely. i like that about Japanese & Korean places. so secretive, exclusive and a delight. Maria M. recommended this place. so we gathered some of our favorite friends and on a SUNDAY night (yes, we all had work the next day!) we met up after i got off work and hopped on the train 4, 5, 6 ?(any of those) Uptown. this is what i was thinking before the arrival, "i hope it's not a typical sushi-packed-up-the-arse restaurant." we wait for our straggling late friend (hehe) and enter the hidden passageway to our Japanese underworld..... Oh..... my...... God....zilla! (yes, i'm cheesy). it was like i was back in Japan all over again. i experienced the same feeling over at Decibel, too. it was so perfect. as i've mentioned in other reviews... i have somewhat of a bathroom fetish. the decor, the ambiance, GOOD smell, cleanliness, accommodations, etc. (wow, sounds like a 5 star hotel suite) their bathrooms- for one person at-a-time, are like pods. you open the bamboo pod's huge door and what's there? a heated/water splashing toilet? oh my, my, my! the candles were lit, the pod didn't reek of horrible possibilities, and it's an enjoyable experience when you'd down a few shots of sake. the boys of our group were purely jealous of our amenities. lol. the fare, presentation, varieties, and service are quintessentially outstanding. this is definitely a place to take a special date, try something new with foodies, dine for a birthday/special occasion or impress some out of towner buddies of yours. the dishes are smaller portioned, but it's meant to be shared/snacked on/etc. LUNCH TIME is a great affair- and definitely a wonderful opportunity to get acquainted with the food before bringing your favorite people over to this hidden oasis. i love that it's not packed or too noisy. however, hanging out with my friends... it tends to be pretty live and loud. lol. the black sesame creme brulee and green tea truffles are a MUST. after 3 bottles of delectable sake, phenomenal service, crazy laughter, and Julie K. fighting with me over her secretly pouring my sake into her glass... it was truly one of the best experiences i've had in NYC. thank you my "favorite friends of Yelp", and ULTRA thanks to Sean, thank you Julie K. for stealing my drinks (muahaha)- but making me laugh and sing "Horang Nabi" like an old Korean drunk, and of course.... thank you to the one and only fabulous Maria M. to finally introducing me to this place i've been dying to search for. ;]

The place was easy to find but in an odd location (not a bad thing at all) ?It's a few blocks from Grand Central so it's easy for people in Westchester to get to if you want good, authentic Japanese food. ?I sat at the sake bar and I'm not that familiar with sake nor am I a tourist but I asked the bartender definitely favored pointing out the most expensive bottles of sake. ?I had the Masakura sake which was very good. ?I also had Maguro Tartar which was very very good. ?The complimentary tea at the end of the night was nice too.

Tastings are a foodie's best friend and I think a Japanese Izakaya is a perfect type of restaurant with its small plates and sake/beer. ?My boyfriend and I came here during our first trip to New York together on our last night. All weekend we've spoiled ourselves with amazing food so we're not expecting any less on our last night. ?We pull up to the address in a taxi and it's this random office building but the address was right. You have to make your way to the basement as their are some inconspicuous signs for the restaurant. ?You kinda doubt yourself as you're walking down that this is really a highly rated restaurant situated in an old building in the BASEMENT with gross steps but once you open the door I feel like I walked into Japan. ?The decor was very nice with traditional Japanese wooden interior. ? We stared at the menu forever because there's so many plates with detailed descriptions. The waitress helped us out with some suggestions and also recommended a particularly good sake which I don't remember the name of and we ordered a half bottle. I didn't think that would be much but it was definitely hard to finish by the end of the night... To start off we got the ebi stick, hirami ponzu, tori karage, and pork belly. My favorites were definitely the hirami ponzu and pork belly! These portions are also generous IMO. ?The hirami ponzu was about 8 pieces of fluke sashimi with some bomb daikon radish and ponzu sauce. It was one of the best tasting sashimi appetizers I've ever had. The pork belly was a large square piece in a very yummy stew. It was a lot bigger than it looked and than I expected so definitely order just one if you're eating other things. Our next batch of plates were their special of the day scallops, minced pork and shrimp (which was basically shumai), grilled eel with cucumber and seaweed, and beef tongue. The scallops were very tasty and fresh. They were covered in egg yolk and had cucumbers on the side. This is the second time I've ever had raw scallops too. The first time was the night before in another New York restuarant. Didn't know it was so common! Another favorite was the very tender beef tongue. Unfortunately this came out last and we were so full we could only eat a part of it =[ For dessert we ordered the black sesame ice cream with black sesame creme brulee which was just as delicious and satisfying as everything else. This is defintely a must visit restaurant in NYC. I suggest getting more of the specialty meat dishes like the beef tongue, pork belly, and try their unique cold dishes! This place also has one of the biggest sake collections for you sake lovers!

An underground kingdom of bamboo and sake drums, Sakagura has got it all. ?Cozy-chic decor, smooth ambience, unfussy but competent service, and goodness gracious great food. My friend and I opted to sit at the bar so we could replenish our plates at will. ?We ordered namazake tastings to go with our meals. ?These consisted of small pours of three different types of unpasteurized sake, all of which came with little explanatory laminated cards - a nice touch for the uninitiated (see, e.g., Steph C.). ?All three were quite good and each different enough from the others to warrant the tasting. To wash that down, we got a smattering of delicious dishes. ?To wit: ichijiku dengaku (figs grilled with miso), gyu miso nikomi (short rib stew), chawanmushi (steamed egg custard), gindara yuan yaki (grilled cod with sweet soy), tori karaage (JFC), and gyutan yawarakani (stewed beef tongue). ?The figs were a flavor triumph, sweet, salty, and interesting. ?The short rib stew, with soft vegetables and grated daikon, was intensely comforting with a robust broth and fall-apart meat. ?I could have done without the chawanmushi, which was overwhelmed by a sour thickened ponzu sauce poured on top. ?The chicken, shrimp, and gingko nuts were nice additions, though they made this dish a toughie to split. ?Cod was scrumptious, cooked moist and flaky, but isn't it always? ?Karaage - big chunks of chicken fried fresh, hot hot through and through - threatened to scorch every nerve in our mouths, but was very tasty. ?The beef tongue, stewed in miso with daikon, taro potato, spinach, and shiitake, was a succulent surprise. ?Yawaraka means "soft" and they weren't kidding. ?I didn't realize huge chunks of tongue could taste so pleasantly fatty. To round out this excellent meal, we ordered the black sesame creme brulee with black sesame ice cream for dessert. ?I've had an almost identical dessert at Cha-An in the East Village, and as much as I love that one, Sakagura's version wins hands down. ?Smooth and creamy with bold sesame flavors, it is to die for. ?Do not miss. I left feeling satisfied but shockingly unbloated. ?This means I can eat more next time. ?I look forward to it.

Hidden down in the basement level of an office building, with great izakaya and a tremendous selection of sake. Loved the Beef Back Ribs, Sashimi and the Siu Mai, as well as the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. I'm not a sake expert, but the wait staff was extremely helpful in explaining and recommending a fantastic sake.

With all of the press Sakagura has received since its debut, you would expect it to be easier to locate. ?However, this gem truly is hidden, first within an office building and then even further down in the depths of the basement. ?The environment does feel a bit claustrophobic at times, but the dark cherrywood decor give it a real traditional flavor. ?On weekday evenings, this Japanese hot spot is full of business diners and professional foodies there to sample the tasty tapas-style cuisine and massive sake menu. ? Sakagura's sake selection really put them on the radar of chefs like Anthony Bourdain, who visited the underground lair in his Manhaatan No Reservations episode. ?There are 3 separate sake menus, including specialties and recommendations. ?Each version is available in 4 different sizes, ranging from cup to bottle. ?Also, the menu contains detailed descriptions of each, so you know what flavor undertones to look forward to. The large culinary menu offers a similarly overwhelming variety of options. ?It is best to order a bunch of dishes for the table to share. ?Most courses are priced between $5-15, which is not bad but tends to add up quickly. ? The Fluke Carpaccio was thinly sliced fresh fluke topped with fresh salmon roe. ?The bland fish really got kicked into high gear with the large salmon roe poured on top of it. ?The plum sauce and flavorful shiso leaves added a sweet and earthy flavor. ?The Maguro Yamakake was an odd-looking bowl of tuna sashimi chunks drowning in a sea of "grated mountain yam". ?I put quotes around the yam because I would not refer to this creamy, chunky mixture as "grated". ?The Kamo Roast consisted of tender slices of roasted duck loosely encasing a bushel of scallion strands. ?A basil sauce was a terrific flavor enhancer. ?We also enjoyed the Satoimo Iridashi, which was essentially an Asian vegetable tempura of taro, eggplant, and shiitake mushrooms. ?The sweet Ebi Shinjo deep-fried shrimp balls were dressed with toasted almonds. ?I loved biting into the crisp puffs and discovering the moist shrimp bits inside. ?Lastly, the Miso Yakionigiri were large grilled rice balls topped with an out-of-this-world rich miso paste. ?Though the balls were unfilled, the thin layer of miso paste added more than enough flavor to compliment the rice. Sakagura is a destination for true, adventurous Japanese fanatics. ?They do not offer your standard California roll, or any sushi rolls for that matter. ?Come here to be dazzled and enjoy a new experience.

I distinctly remember what an amazing, unexpected surprise it was to discover Sakagura when I was living in NYC. Just a few blocks from my Murray Hill pad, there is no way I EVER would have found this place, as you have to walk through the lobby of this blank, unassuming office building and go down to the basement. You are then transported into this understated but swanky Japanese heaven, where the sake list is long, the food is delightfully delicious, and where you will spend a pretty penny for both. It's been years since I've been (and maybe the quality has gone down, given some of the less-than-stellar reviews), but my many experiences there were amazing. I still crave the eggplant three-ways...probably the best eggplant dish I've ever had. It might not be the best Japanese restaurant in New York, but it's worth a visit if you're in the 'hood!

I keep forgetting that I haven't reviewed Sakagura on Yelp yet. ?I've been going there since 2007 and it has stayed consistently at the top of my favorite restaurants in NYC. ?I've tried about everything on their menu, including the natto. ?While there are definitely dishes that I'm not fond of, it's only because the dish isn't to my taste and not because of any deficiency in the quality/prep/presentation. ?The space is also excellent. ?As their specialty, the sake selection is exhaustive and they definitely satisfy my preference for junmai-ginjo sakes. ?Really, everything here is delicious. ?And I always end with the black sesame creme brulee.

i have been meaning to go here for quite a while (since our soba discussion on yelp in '08) and i finally made it - but ?didn't have soba. the space: entering the building it looks very much like you've picked the wrong place. but go down the industrial gray staircase and you arrive in a comfortable space, nicely lit w/out being overly bright - full but not overloud. the menu is arranged by increasing dish size - 1st all the cold then all the warm dishes ignoring the ridiculously expensive bottle of sake we had (there are more reasonable options i assure you - but then there were WAY costlier ones too) the prices were really not bad, given the amount of food we ate. everything was plated beautifully. between 2 of us we had (in no particular order): FLUKE CARPACCIO : Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf this was one of my top 3 tastes of the night - the sour saltiness of the umeboshe paste set the fish off perfectly, and the salmon roe seemed to be lightly marinated in some soy concoction and the olive oil, adding a bass note of richness to their bright pop JAGA DANGO : Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp these were like potato zeppole with a dish of salt on the side. fried mashed potatoes people - are you hearing me? delicious as is, but adding the salt lifted them to a level beyond..... SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU : Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso ( Eggyork {sic}, Spinach,and Sweet Red ) these were ok - well prepped, but all the misos were a bit too sweet, so each was its own monotone flavor. not bad, but not memorable GYU MISO NIKOMI : Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish mm mm mmmm mmm mmmmmm. another fabulous one from my top 3 - long stewed falling apart bits of meaty goodness with miso adding real rounded depth of flavor. a freakin umami bomb. YUBA SHUMAI : Minced Pork Dumpling with Shrimp and Lotus Roots Wrapped in a Thinly Bean Curd Sheet Served with " Ponzu " Japanese Citrus Sauce really good - nothing ridiculously innovative, but in a world where stuff wrapped in stuff tastes good, this stuff tasted really good. the ponzu cut the richness of the pork/shrimp really nicely. the yuba bean curd wrapping was a nice touch over the usual wonton wrapper. also 2 dishes off the specials of the day (so i cannot cut and paste the descriptions) Simmered Octopus with grated mountain yam and wasabi in a light citrusy broth of some sort. very tender - big chunks of octopus, and REAL wasabi, which i think is found in about 1% of restaurants in NYC. A real nose clearing kick. grilled duck and scallions - i think the sauce was a sweetened ponzu but i may not be remembering exactly. really really enjoyable. rich and comforting, even if the braised scallions tended to squirt their middles out if you tried to bite them. 3rd of my top 3. for dessert we had: CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with vanilla Ice Cream & Raspberry Sauce the souffle was good. a very standard dessert, but executed correctly - cakey on the outside, creamy on the in, and a rich chocolate taste that had me putting the raspberry sauce on the ice cream only, because i didn't want to adulterate the souffle flavor. BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream all the components of this were tasty, though i think the ice cream overrode the delicacy of the creme, which was a shame. nice piece of sesame brittle on top. there is a lot more menu to explore here, and i think i could spend my time in many worse ways than doing so. The sake was amazing - crisp, dry, super-premium (over 50% grind on the rice) and cost more than the rest of the meal combined. I'm trying hard to remember the name, so i can purchase it for my house (started w/ a k, came in a bluish squared off bottle - if you know drop me a note) so - do you want to go here? yes. yes you do.

what????? was i missing something???? grr...... the food was just... underwhelming.........maybe if had been drunk on sake everything would've tasted better and tripled in portion... but yea everyone at my table was completely sober. maybe because im spoiled by all the hole in the wall izakaya places in WestLa that this place didnt impress me. the only difference between here and other izakayas that i tried was that the waitresses here were all very confused at everything we said, the portions were way smaller and way more expensive, and the everything had bonito flakes speckled all over them ( the ones you get in a huge bag for a dollar) ?. for the Newyorkers at the table... well i guess they have nothing to compare Sakagura to, so they were very satisfied with the food. however all the LA people were saying how it sucked.and how were were still hungry...... haha..it was good i admit... but not GREAT..... seriously.. ive had wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better. the thing i found uber was the japanese toiletrooms. that was kick ass. well not 'kick' ass... more like.... hahaha.....anyway... is this all NY has to offer for izakaya????? they didnt even have shisamo!!!!!!

Lovely, lovely, lovely. 5 of us went here last week and had a great time. the atmosphere is very zen and calming, even though the space is not huge. We ordered a ton of things from the menu, these were the highlights: - maguro natto - fermented beans, if you can get past the smell and add lot of wasabi, this was good - hirami ponzu - best fluke sashimi ive ever had and the presentation was great - grilled japanese eggplants - yumazing and very different tasting - pork belly - i dont eat pork, but this was DELICIOUS and my friends were kind enought to let me try and then share:) - dessert - the special was amazing and now am desperately seeking japanese crackers, the server told us that you can only get them in japan - sake - amazing selection fo sake, we did splurge and get a 200 dollar bottle, totally worth it. overall, a great meal, service was spotty but when we had his attention, he was great. cannot wait to go again.

Sakagura, hidden away in the basement of a Midtown office building, lures enthusiasts to its subterranean locale with over 200 sakes. In addition to sake, a large menu offers traditional Japanese foods, such as onigiri and edamame, and unique Japanese fare, such as mashed potatoes fried in donut batter. Luckily, the sake menu amply descrbes the ?different sake, making it easy for the sake newbie to confidently order a glass.

Sakagura is spectacular. ?Many of the reviews mention you feel like you are stepping into a slice of Tokyo when you walk down the basement stairs of the office building to the restaurant, and they are certainly spot on. ? There are sake barrels decorating the space as well as large empty sake bottles, of which they have one of the largest selections in the country I've heard. ?We tried four different kinds ourselves, and they were all excellent. ?If you are new to sake like we are, definitely ask for suggestions. ?The service in this respect was excellent. ?Our server took more time than most would have seeing what kinds of wines we liked and then bringing us sake she thought would match our tastes. ?She never once missed that's for sure. ?The masu size was perfect if you find one you like as you get 2 good size square cups for you and your date to sip from. ? The food... oh the food. ?The best that we had was by far Sakagura's Special (BUTA KAKUNI), which was stewed diced pork. ?Get one per person and you will be very happy. ?Since the dishes are mostly relatively small, tapas-sized, plates, we ordered a handful of items. ?Next was the FLUKE CARPACCIO, which was Fluke Sashimi drizzled with olive oil a plum paste and salmon roe. ?The sashimi was very tender and the roe added a nice flavor, but it wasn't my favorite, mostly b/c I am just not a huge roe/sashimi fan. ?My gf seemed to enjoy this a lot, so you might as well. ?Then we got the TORI TSUKUNE (4 Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce), which I thought were very good, but not quite great. ?The YUBA SHUMAI (4 Minced Pork Dumplings with Shrimp and Lotus Roots) was not very flavorful, and was our least favorite dish. ?Since each dish is relatively small, we ordered one more item - SAIKORO STEAK (Diced Steak Sauteed with Olive Oil Flavored with Grated Onion and Soy Sauce). ?The chopped pieces of steak were very flavorful, and quite tender, and the sauce was delish. ? Since we had heard their homemade deserts were to die for, we couldn't resist. ?We were not let down. ?The deserts alone earned this place 5 stars in my book. ?Get the Chocolate Souffle and the Black Sesame Creme Brulee to share. ?You know that feeling when you taste exactly what you were hoping for, and you just can't help a smile coming over your mouth, well that's what these were like. ?You will not be disappointed.

This restaurant is in the basement of an office building. ?I know everyone talks about how its a hidden gem, but its really just a restaurant. ?Decoration isn't bad, but nothing super special. ?What I found most interesting was the bathroom. ?They are in these circular rooms, the door is part of the half circle and bamboo. ?But that's not all - the women's bathroom has one of those japanese everything toilets. ?That means you can do anything humanly possible while on the toilet, heat the seat, spray you butt, wash your front - whatever you can think of, you can do in this bathroom. Ok, enough of this. ?I know the bathroom isn't the highlight of the restaurant, but it was pretty good. I have to say, i know they have an extensive sake menu, but we decided to forgo that and try more of their dishes. Menu items: - MAGURO YAMAKAKE : Fresh Tuna Sashimi Served with Grated Mountain Yam - do not get this unless you like mushiness. ?Maybe I just don't know my mountain yams, but this was by far the worst dish - FLUKE CARPACCIO : Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf - very good, but portion size was tiny - MAGURO TARTAR : Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar - this was heaven. ?I've eaten a lot of tartar this week, and this by far the best. ?Presentation was spot on, and taste was fabulous - JAGA DANGO : Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp ?- interesting preparation of potatoes. ?I am not a fan of potatoes, but this was fried on the outside like a lighter corn dog shell, and the inside tasted like, hm, what is the right taste, ok, I'm going with rice, mashed rice - AMADAI SAIKYO YAKI : Grilled Fillets of Tile Fish Steeped in " SAIKYO " Miso - not great, the fish was old so taste was not the best - SURUMEIKA YAKI : Grilled Japanese Squid Brushed with Garlic Soy Sauce - so salty I had to squeeze 4 lemons on it, and pretty much was the the squid with the lemon juice - HOMEMADE " NIHACHI SOBA " : Cold Plain Buckwheat Noodle Served with Bonito Infused Soy Dipping Sauce - i never know soba could be so good - INANIWA" UDON NOODLE from AKITA : HOT-with Spinach Cold with / Choice of Topping - The worst of the main entrees - SAKE OYAKO DON : Fillets of Fresh Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe Steeped in Soy Sauce Served Atop a bowl of Rice [Served with Miso Soup] - Yum, this was the best of the entrees. ?I really enjoyed the salmon, so fresh, and just beautifully presented - KAISEN KIM-CHEE DON : Assorted Chopped Sashimi Mixed with Kimchee over Rice [Served with Miso Soup] - Par, fish was fresh, nothing innovative I have to say, I am not a dessert person, but its worth getting the homemade truffles. ?We got an order, and they were nice enough to give us one of each: sesame, strawberry, and green tea. ?These were so delicious i ordered some the next week to gift. ?They put 4 in a cute little box, or 10 in a bamboo wood thing. ? This place is definitely pricey, and i didn't even feel the full brunt of the cost since we didn't try any of the sakes. ?If you are planning to come here, make sure you're wallet is fat cause you'll leave with it pretty thin. Note on the service - generally pretty good, though I wish the waiter would have spoken just a little more english. Overall, a good experience. ?Much happier leaving here than i was earlier in the week from Blue Water Grill.

If you want sake, and some snacking food this is the place to go. ?Extensive Sake menu, that might work well with an after work with co-workers senario. A bit loud and noisy but creates a nice atmosphere, similar to drinking restaurants in japan.The price is reasonable. Also recommend for a casual night out with friends

Went here on a Sunday night as soon as it opened up for the evening. What a gem! Despite it's downstairs location, it has a great, authentic atmosphere. We had some sake and the Sesame Seed Creme Brulee with Sesame Seed Ice Cream and it was probably the best ice cream I have ever had. And that's saying a lot because one of my clients is an ice cream company and I've been flying around the world trying ice cream for them. I'm sure their sushi is wonderful too but I'm giving four stars because I didn't try it. Sorry!

I ate here nearly 3 years ago, and the toro sashimi still comes to mind. ?It literally MELTED on my mouth. ?As so many other Yelpers have indicated, the location is really obscure. ?I mean, how many fabulous restaurants can you find that are located in the basement of a building? ?Reservations are a must for this place since it gets super busy. ?Also, be ready to fork out some major $. ?The quality is impeccable, and the prices show it.

Upon entry I realized its one of the joints mentioned by Bourdain. ?Sashimi is pricey $48 for 5 kinds 3 pc each but fresh enough so I guess factoring in the NYC price premium it's ok. ?Sanma (cooked) onigiri was way too challenging for my stomach and olfactories. ?I kept burping sanma all night. ?Other stuff like gyutan and seaweed salad are, well, good but pretty much like Tanto or Gochi of the Bay Area. ?3.5 stars rounded up to 4.

My cousin was coming over to hang out with me so he let me decided on a place and me and him both bookmark this place to try so 1 less to worry about. We took the cab and they drop us right in front of this place. At first I didn't know where to go but I remember reading on yelp that it is in the basement. Some girl waiting for her ride saw us looking for the restaurant so she say yes just go downstaire.I like the way it was design and the place look and feel awesome. There were a whole book just for different types of sake and some of them ran to hundred and thousands. I pick the Saturday special sake which was a good deal for $13 for a small bottle. We all decided to pick 2 dishes each so I pick the eel vinaigrette and the sea urchin with a eggs. Both of them were very disappointed and not even worth it. I also pick the Spicy cod fish roe but it was all salt and believe me, I can eat a lot of salt but this dish I barely could touch it. I order the uni soba which I was excited about but later on they told me that they ran out of this. So I order a few more dishes but nothing was really tasty. The highlight of the night was ordering the black seed cream brulee which was soo dam tasty. I could have eaten another one all by myself. Overall this experience suck, don't get me wrong I like the sake and the evironment but the food just suck. Next time I will just drink.

Sakagura (aka 'Decibel for adults') is a great spot for very solid izakaya style Japanese. ?The sake list is overwhelming - tons to choose from across all types of sake. ?The food is fantastic! ?The miso eggplant dish, the kimchee sashimi rice bowl, ?various tofus, meat that you can cook at your table... even the desserts are very good. ?You have to walk into an office building and then down some stairs to find this spot - a little strange, but worth the effort. ?If you're looking for something a little different than a standard sushi joint, this is a great option. ?Decibel is still awesome (and I believe has the same owners), but Sakagura is a little more refined, and the food here is definitely a few levels better.

one of my favorite japanese restaurants. but then again, japanese is my favorite cuisine. decor - so bamboo. so japanese-underground. check out the toilet and get a taste of tokyo bathroom-philia. food - frickin tasty. i won't even go into how yummy and savory the dishes are. they're all good. actually, the chicken karage is mediocre - i've had better at other places. but damn, the rest are superb. the green tea truffle dessert is something that, if you don't partake in, would be preventing a well-rounded existence. service - typical attentive, polite japanese. i think we got warm hand towels and what not. price is what it is. excellent food for reasonable prices. you get what you pay for. one thing i love about this place is the cool utensils and set up of the dishes. i love how the japanese obsess over presentation and extraneous tools. they have one dish where you head raw chunks of beef on a heated stone.

It's hard to find a decent Japanese lunch in NYC without feeling like you shelled out too much for it. Even harder to find a fancy Japanese dinner that actually left you with a feeling that you got what you paid for (*cough* Megu). Saka Gura wowed me with its lunch bowls and desert. The menu was creative and executed beautifully. ?I tried Oyako Don ($11.50) with Wisdom Sake tasting ($10), and for dessert, a beautiful sesame creme brulee, which turned out to be the best desert I ever had in a Japanese restaurant (no yucky sticky rice buns). I can't wait to try the truffles, next time. Tucked away int he basement with no cell phone service, Sakagura is truly a treasure for some authentic(?) and quality Japanese cuisine and ?a great sake infused conversation (that is given your friend/s find the place) Everything here is definitely worth price, and flavors won't leave you disappointed.

I love this place for a first date. ?The food is okay, and can get a little eperimental at time (one date called it fear factor). ?But, you find out very quickly what kind of person you are with. ?I find the more experimental an eater the more fun they are behind closed doors. ?So, while this place doesn't thrill with the food, the ambiance (downtown tokyo), decor, and sake make up for it. ?The sake list can be daunting, but a great selection.

hmm....a sake speakeasy that serves soba...what a concept! ? my inaugural foray for soba in NYC landed me in this secret dark wood paneled basement. ?the lunch reviews are true - $11.50 special with very good soba, but they have really nice hot and cold soba dishes ranging from $11.50 to $20 on the menu that looked absolutely tasty. ? ?having been in boston for the past 8 yrs...i can now thank the gods a good portion of soba no longer requires airfare to the west coast... i'm not much of a drinker but for those who like to savor a good drink the sake wall is worth seeing...

I came here for the lunch and had the $30 "lunch tasting" which consisted of assorted sashimi/sushi, assortment of tempura, grilled fish and beef ?fillet steak, soba noodles, and dessert. ?I would descrbe the food as boring. ?Not much, if at all, different from the sushi at any other midtown sushi place... ?Nothing to hate, nothing to love... just very, very average...

For a non-Japanese person, I consume far too much miso soup. ?None has ever been as good as what Sakagura serves. ?My palate was unexpectedly surprised to even have some, since the salmon and rice I had were delicious all on their own. ?Yes, the salmon was so fresh I thought it may still be alive. ?Rice is unfortunately underappreciated nowadays, by chefs and consumers both. ?At Sakagura, it is not -- no, it has great texture and consistency. ?I went for lunch so I missed out on the sake. ?Yea, you ask who comes to a sake joint and doesn't drink? ?Me, my coworker, and about 500 other people. ?It was busy and loud but you're not coming here for the quiet ambiance, are you?

Wow - comparable only to Kyo Ya. ?Exquisite Japanese cuisine. ?Every time I dine at a restaurant like this, my resolve is confirmed as to why Japanese is my favorite food of all time. ?Onsen tomago - softboiled egg in cold soup with sea urchin - outstanding, must have. ?Maguro yamakake - tuna with yam - interesting, refreshing, good. ?Uzaku - eel and seaweed - tender, flavorful, excellent. ?Seaweed salad - 4 types of seaweed, a little different than the usual, beautiful. ?Buta kakuni - pork belly - fantastic lick-your-lips fatty goodness. ?Grilled eggplant with three types of miso - absolutely delicious and surprisingly one of our favorite selections. ?Special of day - grilled sweet fish with sea salt - gorgeous but very little actual fish... hehe. ?Dessert: black sesame creme brulee with sesame ice cream - outstanding in flavor. ?Everything amazing (other than odd location), must break my rule to not eat at the same place twice - will certainly come back again someday.

Had dinner here with my wife and my sister. We ordered about 6 or 7 different items and shared them all. The hot stone where you cook the meat yourself was pretty good (and fun after a few sakes). The ribs in broth were excellent. ?But the seasonal sashimi dish with 9 small pieces for $55 was a disappointment. The atmosphere and service was on point. To me, the best part of the meal was the plum wine sampler at the end! Some really great plum wines that I hadn't tried before; very delicious!!

Sakagura has it all - wonderful atmosphere, authentic dishes and a very helpful staff. Please do not confuse it with a restaurant! It falls more under the category of a bar. All of the dishes on the menu accompany a certain type of sake. In Japan these type of establishments are used for a pre-dinner drink, where the main meal comes afterwards in an actual restaurant.

I saw this restaurant on Yelp and heard about it from friends, as a visitor from LA. ?So you have to remember, this is a LA perspective -- a place where often times you have to trade off great food with bad service/ambiance and vice versa (I'm not hating, just stating my opinion). ? One of the best aspects of New York that I absolutely love was... its genuineness. ?In this over-crowded, word-of-mouth, ultra-critical (again, not hating), restaurant environment in Manhattan, hype is not a word or concept that is uttered. ?So many of the restaurants had great good, service and ambiance. ?And to me, Sakagura was a standout in all categories. ?The wait staff was attentive at replacing the flatware, replenishing the water, delivering the food in a timely manner (as we finished each dish), and recommending the myriad of sakes in their collection. ?The place was dimly lit, with just enough lighting to pass for a casual dining establishment, but intimate enough for a date. ?And the food! ?Expertly prepared, as close to the subtle mastery you'd find in Japan as you'd expect to find here thousands of miles away. ?Fried foods were delicately battered and perfectly fried. ?Most of the sauces were flavorful, but still retained their subtle flavors. ? I won't repeat what others have said here, but some of the more memorable dishes for me were: ? * ?Uni, crab over sushi rice--Probably my favorite dish. ?It was surprising to eat the slightly cooked uni -- almost like crab roe but the combination of the three was awesome * Jellyfish with persimmons and cucumber -- very subtle miso, sesame flavors (however, not enough jellyfish for my Chinese taste); ? Uber yummy, but expensive at $28 for a small bowl (it was actually served on a small crab shell). * ?Stewed pork -- very fatty, but very well steamed and seasoned. ? * ?Sake -- well, you can order about any type, from the unfiltered to the ultra filtered, sweet or dry, etc. ?By far one of the best aspects of the restaurant, but a bit pricey. ? So some people complain about the service -- yes, overall throughout dinner it was excellent. ?But then it took 1/2 hr to get the check, because non of the wait staff came by. ?To their defense, it was towards the end of the night and most of the patrons were gone, but still....

4.5 stars. We shared the filet mignon over hot stone, grilled duck with slice of scallion, fluke sashimi with salmon roe, seaweed salad, chopped salmon sashimi mixed with kimchee over rice, beef back ribs in a miso stew, soba, tuna sashimi with natto, and black sesame breme brulee. My favorite was the beef back ribs in the miso stew with grated daikon radish. ?The broth was so rich and flavorful without being too salty, the ribs extremely tender, an amazing dish! ?The seaweed salad came with 4 different types of seaweed, very unique! I've never had so many different types of seaweed! The duck was very tender, each piece accompanied with a slice of scallion. ?The filet mignon came as 6-8 raw pieces and was served with a hot stone and a piece of steak fat. ?The fat was rubbed all over the stone, and we were able to cook the meat to our liking. ?A scoop of msg and a small bowl of soy dipping sauce completed this interesting dish! ?All the other dishes were very fresh and tasty! ? The waiter brought out a second hot stone for the steak when he saw that our stone was cooling off (and not really cooking the meat anymore). ?Service was prompt and very attentive. ? A wonderful find!! Especially if you want to dine izakaya-style and NOT be in a loud place... Thanks T!

I love this place and have been going here for years now. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I think the food has gone a little downhill since the "mainstream" discovered this hidden spot.

After looking for the entrance for 10 minutes, only to discover I was right in front of it the whole time, I was delighted and surprised by some very interesting and unique food. The wait staff was more than willing to take the time to explain the vagaries of their menu to my thoroughly western pallet. So was the Sake Sommelier (?).

Such a pleasant surprise to walk into the restaurant. A great example of what creativity can do with a space.

"It's so real dude, it's so real..." This was the first thing out of my friend's mouth and the perfect introduction to Sakagura. I have never had such an amazing, fresh, and traditional japanese meal in my life. I have been waiting to try sakagura for months now, as it has not been easy to talk many of my less-than-adventurous friends into trying a truly traditional japanese restuarant with no sushi on the menu. But thankfully, last week my friend dragged me up to Brooks Brothers so I had an excuse to walk us over a few blocks to sakagura. I loved how sakagura was hidden right across from Sushi Yasuda and next to Yakitori Totto in the basement of an office building. Score one for Sakagura! We were initially turned away, but after some discussion about sake and then staging a walk out, we were chased to the top of the stairs by the hostess, who in fact did seat us, and at a nice table at that. Score two for sakagura. Sakagura has the best sake list I've ever seen. And that includes Decibel. I thought they had it on lock down, but sakagura is the only place that can match them. More premium sakes here than I have ever seen on one list, and there were not only big names, but small breweries represented as well. Both japanese and american importers were on the list, which showcased a full range of all different types of sakes. I was tended to patiently by the staff while I asked endless questions, trying to find the right sake. I did find the perfect bottle with their help, and they were nice enough to let me taste two so I could make up my mind. Score 3 for Sakagura. ? On to the menu: This was some of the freshest fish I've ever had in my life. I felt like they smacked me in the face with a live fish and said "take a bite!" Most plates were between $8-15, with many under $12. My friends and I ordered seaweed salad (hands down best that I've ever had) and a cold spinach dish with mashed sesame seeds to start. Miso Soups followed, and NOT the salty prepackaged kind. It was the real deal, with either tofu or shiitake mushrooms, your choice. Awesome. Sake marinated deep fried chicken was incredible, perfectly cooked, crispy outside and perfect inside. Hirame sashimi was also incredibly good, and the real fish roe (none of that canned/crap in a jar) is what solicited my friends' statement about the "REAL" factor of their food. An amazing sashimi over rice with salmon, tuna, squid, yellowtail, and more was just incredible, and only $15. I've never seen anything with a price:quality ratio like that, and in midtown manhattan nonetheless! The one thing that I have to say was too weird for me was the fermented soy beans that came with my tuna sashimi. I have to blame this on myself, I was not prepared for the slimy, mid-fermentation soy beans that had a texture that was absolutely not edible for my american palate. Slimy things come out of, and do not go into peoples' bodies, and that texture I just cannot handle. However, I know that in Japan people eat many-a-slimy food items, so no criticism from me on that. :) ?Another favorite of mine from the meal was the home-made pork shumai with lotus root. This was the absolute best shumai ever, and we had to order a second plate. After sake and food, we were too stuffed for desert. That was too bad because I hear it is really good. I'll save that for next time. To summarize, Sakagura is the best quality food, and the best value that I've had from any Japanese establishment in the city. I would go back any chance I get, and cannot wait for another opportunity to peruse that sake list. I need to post one WARNING: this is NOT an american japanese restaurant. If you don't like really fresh fish, or if you cannot eat food that tastes like the ocean, DO NOT eat at sakagura. This is NOT a fusion restaurant, and you will not find ANY of the americanized dishes here. Sakagura is the place for a truly traditional and amazingly fresh japanese meal, and some great sake. It is NOT for people afraid of trying something new. Kanpai!

Love love love Sakagura's!!! ?I used to live in Japan and this place is quintessential Japan! ?I tried the lunch tasting menu. ?Tried fish tempura for the first time here. ?The sushi was fantastic - loved the hotate (scallops) and the sake (salmon). ?Beef was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. ?Tried sesame creme brulee here for the first time and absolutely LOVED it! ?But I love sesame and I also love creme brulee, so you really couldn't go wrong with combining 2 things I already liked a lot. Staff were attentive and all spoke Japanese. ?Service was impeccable - only minor complaint is that they do get busy and take more time to refill the tea than I would have like.

This place has excellent service, but the location and food quality to price ratio drove my 2 star rating. ?The location is a moderate detractor but the real kicker is the moderate price to less than average food quality/quantity. $45 will get a lunch for two that includes 4 shrimp tempura (total) 2 bowls of rice and 2 bowls of soba noodles. ?The tempura and noodle broth were very middle of the road and the rice and soba noodles were rice and soba noodles so nothing mind blowing there. ? There was nothing bad about my visit, I just think there are much better lunch options around and don't think I'd ever go back.

Probably one of the best meals I've had- it is a dining EXPERIENCE, not just dinner. ?To be honest, I dined here about a few months ago, so I can't really give good descriptions about each dish- off the top of my head, we had the yuba shumai, nasu dengaku, a duck dish, and another dish of rice that came with some kimchi and sashimi on top (my favorite). ? Everything was excellent. ?THe service, the food...perfect. ?Definitely the most authentic Japanese restaurant I've been to. ?I love that it's a Japanese restaurant NOT about raw fish.

Great sake, for one who does not like sake, I actually did. ?Have the server recommend some. ?Every dish we tried were delicious, except for the rice porridge and fried chicken. ?My favorite was the eel w/ cucumbers, and the beef tips roasted on a stone. ?Get ready to spend a lot of money on small portions, but it was well worth it. ?Service was a bit slow, have time to savor the food, talk, and wait.

This is my favorite restaurant in Manhattan. It's very intimate and the food is phenomenal--a revelation. I usually get the kaisen don set for lunch, which is an assortment of sashimi on sushi rice, with some hot or cold soba noodles, and Japanese pickles. And for dinner I always get several small dishes, including the onsen tamago, which is a cold dashi soup with uni, ikura, and a soft-boiled egg. Heaven. I have many other favorites, like the soy-braised cod and the beef tongue. Drinking sake there is a delightful experience, especially if you order the Masu, where the sake is served in a traditional lacquered box. The desserts are also great, which hasn't always been my experience in Japanese restaurants. I especially like the sea salt chocolate sorbet and the black sesame creme brulee. Lunch or dinner will set you back, but it's worth it.

I think this is my favorite restaurant in NYC! ? I've been here a few times, and it has been a wonderful experience every, single time! ?This is a Japanese tapa-style restaurant! ?He he... I like this because I'm just greedy and like to taste everything! ?I haven't tried a lot of their dishes on the menu yet, but I just love, love, love the Kamo Roast (roasted duck with scallion and some amazing special basil sauce), Maguro Tartar (tuna tartar with ?caviar), and Sake Oyako Don (salmon sashimi and roe over rice) ?Words cannot describe how heavenly and unique the salmon and roe tasted!

Fantastic Experience! Lunch here was a welcomed respite from the chaos of midday midtown Manhattan! The staff is super friendly and professional. The menu is varied and creative with a slight flair for drama. The setting is authentic and fun. If you have the opportunity treat yourself to Saka Gura. It's a treat that offers value and excitement...

After a recent trip to Japan I had a serious hankering for some authentic Japanese cuisine and found this place through yelp. Went for a lunch date with my husband today. Upon arriving I felt like I had been transported back to Japan. It was pretty crowded for lunch so I recommend making reservations. We ordered the Sashimi Gozen and Jewel Oke Bento. Sashimi was delicate and fresh. The best part of the meal was definitely the black sesame creme brulee. It comes with a scoop of homemade black sesame ice cream and a black sesame praline crisp on top. We licked our spoons clean.

Probably the best sake selection you'll find anywhere around here. ?In this hidden underground gem of a place, you'll not only find a great variety of sake but also authentic Japanese fare (most of which are perfect accompaniment for sake), awesome dessert (as Yoko I. pointed out, the green tea and strawberry truffles and the black sesame creme brulee are amazing), helpful knowledgeable service, and a cool, romantic vibe. ?The location is unassuming (basement of an overly bright office bldg in a fairly quiet block, but ideally right across from Sushi Yasuda) and the menu can be somewhat overwhelming with the unfamiliar but that's the fun of this place. ?I'm no sake connoisseur but Sakagura will inspire you to become one!

The atmosphere is great and quality of food is wonderful. ?I thoroughly enjoyed every dish I tried. ?I enjoyed the flavor and texture of the cheese tofu, the tuna in the tuna with yam sauce was very good, I also enjoyed the beef cooked on a rock... be sure to keep it on the rare side so it does not overcook. ?The meal can be pricey if you have a big appetite but it's well worth it. ?If you're not sure about which sake to try, just ask the waiters to recommend a few.

I have eaten at Sakagura about six or eight times. It is beneath the basement of 43rd Street between 3rd and 2nd Avenue, the downsides of the restaurant are the size (which means that it literally feels like you are sitting in a mob bar) and also the very traditional Japanese menu (if you are traveling with non- Japanese individuals). Once my companions were very surprised by the menu. I personally love the variety of sake (the name does mean "sake warehouse" and the restaurant always has winning sake) and the variety of sushi. As for the other dishes on the menu, some of the meat dishes are excellent as well. Be certain to call ahead for a reservation - the seating is limited and the restaurant is always crowded!

Sake selection is very robust, they give you three menus of their sake collection. Unfortunately, I'm not much of a sake drinker. But besides that, had a wonderful dinner here. I recommend the grilled eel and the tuna tartar. For the main course, we selected the "fillets of beef", a chef's selection for that day. Slices of beef served with a heating stone to cook it on. A novel idea, but by the time we were trying to grill the last couple of pieces, the stone just didn't have enough steam. Oh well, I appreciated the effort. For dessert, definitely can't go wrong with the Black Sesame Creme Brulee.

Altogether, very authentic and delicious. ?Unfortunately, one needs to pay about 3x more than in Tokyo for it here...

my friends and i fondly refer to sakagura as the "bat cave" with the underground seating and cavernous ambience. ?we particularly loved the sprinkled salt around the doorway (to keep away unwanted and evil spirits) and the simple decor of japanese izakaya's. ? as for the food, we ordered the hirame carpaccio and the maguro tar tar (both excellent), a bowl of the stinkiest natto around and the most memorable cold uni soup i've ever had. ?my friend said it best when he said, "it's not necessarily the quality of their food that i'm so happy with but the variety of cool dishes!" we had their dessert sampler which was absolutely delightful~ ?i actually started clapping my hands when i saw our waitress bring out the dessert tray. caveats? ?the entrance is a 'bit hard to find. ?their signs are a little obscure but i think if anything, that adds to the allure. ?sakagura is most definitely one of the best kept secrets of nyc, and quite literally part of the "underground" restaurant scene. ? i used to go to sushi yasuda (right down the street) quite often but with difficulties in making reservations and the near impossibilities of walk-ins, sakagura offers a nice alternative to an otherwise spoiled evening.

This place is great. ?Just finding it was an adventure all in itself. ?At first, I thought I was heading into a grimy place but when opening the door into the restaurant I was extremely surprised. The decor is great. ?Besides all the wood there is a big paper mache person hanging from the ceiling in the back which is fun. ?There are plenty of tables so reservations are not required but are a good idea because they are popular. ? The food was just ok. ?I had asked out waitress to bring over some traditional japanese food but all we got was some blue fin tuna and a few fish balls. ?Don't get me wrong, they were decent but I was hoping for something a little more adventurous. ?The desserts were just ok. ? HOWEVER, the saki is another story...Their menu is out of this world and they are very helpful with taste and drinkability. ?Before coming here I had never thought of drinking saki like you do wine but with the quality they have here you don't drop this stuff in your beer or shoot it down. ?We ended up getting one of their moderately priced bottles ($80) but it was great. ?750 ml bottle. ?After we finished this, we asked for something a little stronger. ?My friend had turned my onto Sho-Chu which is a type Japanese vodka. ?It was delicious. ?By the time we had to go, I was seeing double but I was extremely happy with my experience there. Just as a precation, bring the address and follow the directions all the way down into the dungeon.

Hidden gem. Food is absolutely amazing. Went on a Saturday night at 7pm. Called ahead to see the wait.. lady told us ten minutes. When we got there we were seated immediately. The place is extremely spacious. The wait staff is very friendly. They do not rush you and each group of diners had their own privacy. Decor and atmosphere are wonderful. Yrs it is a bit pricey, but high quality foods. So delicious. We ordered the seared tuna, fillet mignon, beef in miso sauce, deep fried mashed potatoes, chicken meatballs, black sesame cream brulee, and mango pudding (special). Everything was perfect. Bill was about $75 before tip. Shorts, jeans, etc are ok. Great casual elegant Japanese restaurant. No sushi! Oh lots of sake choices. Lychee sake looked good though. Definitely going back!

This restaurant got such great reviews everywhere that we really wanted to try it when we went to New York. We were a little scared when we walked in, because it was in the basement, and the walk down was dark... But when we walked in, it was SO beautiful, and SO romantic. We didn't know what to order, since everything looked so good. So we asked our waitress what she recommended, and that was what we ordered. The sushi was fresh and delicious. And the pear millefeuille was actually my favorite part of the night! I was so glad that I was able to share this amazing experience with my boyfriend. Be sure to try the millions of kinds of sake!

what is all the hype about? ?i am really baffled!!! ? i knew i was in for a rough night when we walked down to the substation of this office building and it faintly smelled like a bathroom. only a couple of things this place is worthy of mention. ?if you don't want to spend 600 bucks on a full bottle of daishichi to try the most expensive sake in the world then you can order a taster size here - unfortunately it was not worth it, overly hyped and explains why this sake is only popular outside of japan. ?the onigiri topped with saba was the only dish that was worthy of 5 stars. ?everything else was just a huge disappointment. the pork belly was worthy of 3 stars it was way tougher than i am use too. ?the hanger steak cooked on a hot stone was ok too but i could do the same at home. ?the steak was nothing special and it wasn't even marinated. ?the umiboshi was probably pickled not more than a week and was slightly too sweet. the duck was dry and quite bland. ?tuna tartar was grizzly. ?the grilled clams were gritty - come on even i know you are suppose to soak clams in a huge bucket of water for at least 24 hours so they will spit out the sand, before you even attempt to cook them. they focus too much on food presentation but even at that there really ios no art to it and it just doesn't deliver to the palate. ?if you want great presentation AND taste go to aki on west 4th. I will never come back here again. ?time is too short to be wasted on a poser place.

Wow - I had no expectations walking into this place and in every aspect, my mind was blown away. ?The location is part of its charm; you walk into an office building, go down a staircase and all of a sudden find yourself in a cozy traditional looking Japanese restaurant. ?There is a sake cellar and sapporo on draft - yum! ?4 of us STUFFED ourselves for about $200 including tip and it was THE best Japanese food I have eaten. ?The table ordered jagadango [potato croquette things] that were INCREDIBLY fluffy and not oily, a sashimi platter with the most sea urchin i have ever seen served in one plate, duck with green onions, two servings of soba, and the chocolate sea salt ice cream and the black sesame truffles for dessert. ?The meal was followed with that really great green tea that almost smells like fresh plants and tastes like popcorn. ?Additionally the service was excellent and the bathrooms were clean, modern and really fun.

To be honest, I think Sakagura is a bit overrated. Been here for lunch and dinner, and I was definitely happier for lunch. Had the lunch special of the day with soba, good soba (but to be expected for the price) and portion was great. However...I was a bit disappointed when I came for dinner. Their extensive menu both for food and drinks was impressive and I looooove sake, so I thought I'd found heaven. But the food was just okay. I ordered a ton because I really wanted to sample everything, and nothing was really memorable. I was pretty wasted that night, but I remember ordering: tamagoyaki with eel (eel tasted a bit muddy), shiromi nanban (wasn't the freshest fish I'd had), jaga dango, ebi shinjo (my favorite, but could've used a sauce or been more flavored to start with), gindara yuan yaki, sanshoku nasu dengaku, tori karaage, cold soba, ikura onigiri and miso soup. That's a big meal for 2 but we probably could have finished it all had it all been really good. Best part of Sakagura was the sweetest server who took care of us at the counter. We went about an hour before closing on a Sunday night and a lot of places will rush you, but never got that, and she was extremely polite and apologetic when telling us it was last call to place orders. I might go again for a late night snack if I happen to be in the area, but Sakagura fails to win a special place in my heart. I'll probably go to Robataya in the East Village when i want sake and small Japanese dishes instead--same owner anyway, lots of sake (though a tiny fraction of what Sakagura has), more imaginative menu, and fresher fish.

This restaurant is horrible for a myriad of reasons but let me elaborate. 1. They do not have any hot sauce no siracha, no pepper flakes, no chilly oil. 2. They do not make any type of roles My friend and I ordered Edamame, Seaweed Salad, Miso Soup, Grilled Chicken Dish,and a Fried Tofu dish. Edamame was great Seaweed salad had some gummy consistency Grilled chicken dish had the skin and fat on the chicken breast which was inedible. The fried tofu was served in large marshmallow type cubes but when you sliced the cube the inside had a Bearnaise sauce type of consistency which is inedible. ? The server refused to deviate from the menu. I asked if he could make tempura immediately he said no. Do not go to this restaurant period.

When we decided on Sakagura, my bf remembered it really good from the past and I saw they got 4 stars so we took our out-of-towner friends here. We ordered numerous amounts of plates, love that they're tapas style however they aren't very tasteful. There was nothing that we ordered that was "GREAT."

I've been wanting to eat here since March when Yumi and I were talking about original Japanese shelters in New York. Happens to be from the same owners of Decibel and since then my curiosity grew constantly. Long story short, we went there on a Thursday and had the $11.50 soba lunch special (only 50 available) and Oyako Don with an awesome buckwheat beer from Oregon. Simply fantastic and clearly a solid lunch option if you happen to be in NY. Soba is handmade, with a pleasant texture/chewiness and a rich buckwheat finish. Yumi tells me from their own organic farm but I wasn't able to find the info. The place got packed in 20 minutes around noon so be sure to make a reservation if you want to grab your lunch special, a serious deal including soba and a seasonal chirashi (changes everyday). The rice was just perfect and overall you will find yourself here again and again, just for the cozy ambiance. I seriously would have had a hard time finding it considering that it's nested below an office building, somehow the same secluded location of Decibel. An absolute must, straight from Yumi's repertoire.

i really didn't expect this place to be good at all. it's in the basement of an office building, all the way in the east 40's -- a neighborhood i rarely go to to hang out. when my friend and i got there, it was completely packed. ?and even though he had made reservations, we still had to wait for a little bit. i was super annoyed by that time, but the night turned out to be a pleasant tasting experience. i was really surprised when their food and sake came out. all their plates were pretty amazing and there wasn't a dish that i did not like. and the funny thing is, i never liked sake until tonight. no joke. and i realized that i probably drank the wrong type of sake my entire life -- the dry kind or the heavy milky kind. the great thing about this place was the servers were very knowledgeable in the assortment of sake's and food, and they were also very (very) patient and nice with inexperienced sake drinkers like us. our server let us taste three different kinds before getting a bottle. i don't know the name of the sake we drank tonight, but if you ask the server for a "very easy to drink sake," they will probably all recommend the same one. if you're ever in the area, and even if you aren't, i really recommend you checking out this place. it's totally worth the hassle.

I walked away impressed. ?This place is a must for sake lovers and enthusiasts as well as those who are just getting into sake. ?This is a higher end izakaya (japanese pub) of which many can be found on St. Marks but this place has a slightly calmer atmosphere and the food is slightly more refined as well. ?Their sake list is extensive, and the menu list isnt as crazy as the other izakaya, meaning they dont offer a million things with items placed randomly on the menu like the other izakayas on St. Marks. ? Everything we ordered was delicious, including the dessert. ?The Maguro tartar with all that caviar on top isnt as good as the pictures make it, but it was still pretty darn good. ?We ordered a grilled eggplant dish with 3 different sauces, and my wife who is an eggplant lover really appreciated it. ?It was the SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU : Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso ( Eggyork, Spinach, and Sweet Red ) We also ordered the ONSEN TAMAGO : Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup. ?This was a very unique dish, and the broth was superb. ?The pork belly dish is also classic and a crowd pleaser; juicy and fatty in a light broth. ?The miso cod was also very good and at 9 dollars we got more then we expected which is always welcome! ?For dessert the PEAR MILLEFEUILLE with Earl Gray Ice Cream was ordered since we wanted to try something unique. ?It was also well received! ?Not too sweet, but sweet enough and fruity We spent a little over a 100 dollars for 2, both had drinks and stuffed our faces. ?

The restaurant opens exactly at 6pm, even if you go earlier- it isn't open. The place is in the basement and it's actually not that visible to find since you have to go into the building. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty nice and there were masks on the wall. The tuna tartar had a fishy taste to it which I don't think it's suppose to be there. The homemade "Nihachi Soba" and "Inaniwa" udon noodle from Akita wasn't that great. However, the desserts were delicious. The chocolate souffle with the ice cream was a good combination since you can take a bite of the warm chocolate souffle and then a bite of cold ice cream- YUM!! As for the black sesame cream brulee, it was unique since it was my first time trying it and is definitely worth a try. The other dessert seemed like it's G?teau aux Marrons and it only tasted alright. Also, the fruity cocktail I got was pretty good. I believe this place is more for having a drink with appetizers rather than having a real dinner.

Easily one of my favorite places to eat. 200+ sakes and an absurdly good lunch deal. Best to make a reservation for dinner. Charming service (incl. the hot towel before & after), good green tea, and very fine food. I would sell friends for an extra scoop of the sea salt chocolate sorbet.

My favorite is their assorted sashimi. ?All so fresh and everything is edible, even those purple flowers! ?This dish somehow reminds me of another delicate sashimi dish I had in Kaygetsu, Menlo Park, CA. ?We loved it so much and we ordered two. ?We actually didn't get to finish the uni in the second platter. ?What a waste!! ?This place has great combination of sashimi and grill food selections. ?Unless you do some research ahead of time or go with a new yorker, there is no way you can find this place. ?It is in a basement of an office building mid town. ?You also need to reserve couple days earlier to ensure availability... ?overall, i love the ambiance, the food, oh, did I mention about their barrel designed restrooms? ?Pretty cool!

just went there again. love that the kitchen closes at 11:45pm on a weeknight. Great japanese service(attentive, helpful, respectful) and food. we got the pork special butaniku - sweet, melts in your mouth, yummy shrimp balls covered in almonds - how can you go wrong with that ochazuke - huge portion of rice - could serve 2 soba - my daughter loved! batter covered potato - oh so naughty! free range chicken - with yuzu/pepper and sea salt on side chawan-mushi - huge portion o- i ordered too much food! finished off with light lychee sorbet (2 scoops) comes with sesame crisp dessert comes with hot tea. child friendly - in that they gave us a booth and my kid loved it. though no strollers or high chairs are allowed in for fire reasons. each dish is executed perfectly and beautifully toilet had automatic up/down for cover! my 2.5 y/o wanted to try the water wash option but I think they disabled it. $110 including tax for all this...

My new favorite izakaya restaurant ever. I've been to a few others in New York and Los Angeles, and none have compared to the authenticity I felt here. The ambiance is nice in a dimly lit, wooden décor setting. There were many notable items on the menu and a fully stocked sake bar. For my party of 5, we ordered somewhere upwards of 20 dishes. It wasn't cheap, and we were squished into a tiny table- but were still delighted each time a new dish arrived at our table. The names of the dishes were all in Japanese so you should have an idea of what you're ordering beforehand (ordering right can make all the difference for your experience here). Of all the well-known dishes, the special buta-kakuni (pork belly) was the only item that didn't live up to all the hype. It is not for those that shy away from fat and in my opinion large enough for 2 to share. We had each ordered our own portions and had quite a bit leftover. Definitely leave room for dessert- we tried both the sesame crème brulee and chocolate soufflé and they were the perfect cap to an amazing meal. The restaurant itself is pretty hidden from street level (with poor reception in the basement) so if you are coming with a large party it is probably best to meet outside before going in. I almost want to take away a star (or -0.5 stars?) for the hostess that gave us a bit of attitude when they had to rearrange the seating to fit 5 instead of 4 people. I didn't find the friendliest of service people here, but its ok- the food wholly makes up for it.

One of the best Japanese "tapas" places I've been to. ?We ordered so many dishes that I can't remember all of them. ?But the ones that stood out in my mind the most were Gyutan Yawaraka Ni (beef tongue stewed in miso) and the pork belly. ?The beef tongue was so tender and flavorful and pork belly is just fatty goodness. ?The sashimi is very fresh but I only wish the slices were larger. ?The sake list is substantial and complements your meal very well. ?Be prepared to spend a bit since these dishes are small and might not immediately fill you but every bite is well worth it!

This place is much more reasonably priced that most places I've been to. ?Our table of 4 shared at least 8 different items and our bill was only $125, which included 3 big bottles of beer. ?Of the dishes the seaweed salad, cold tofu, chawanmushi, beef cooked on a hot stone, and the house specialty stewed pork were all very good. ?One little side note: Stewed pork can be shared between two people. ?We made the mistake of ordering one per person and were a little overwhelmed (and guilt-ridden) by the rich fatty goodness. ?Be sure to know the address when going for the first time. ?There's no signage except for a tiny little sign in the doorway in tiny print. ?It's in the basement level of an office building.

One visit and I fell in love. I don't drink so their sake collection doesn't even have anything to do with it (though it's a big plus for my husband.) One of the best Japanese restaurants we've ever been to, for sure. Every single dish we had there was excellent. We had salmon tataki, tuna tartare, chawanmushi, seaweed salad, roast duck roll, and grilled cod for those of you who are curious. And of course black sesame creme brulee to finish, which was sublime. I love black sesame flavored desserts, and this was one of the best I've ever had. It's not cheap, especially considering the portions are quite small, but I felt it was worth every penny. I can't wait to go back, and I have a feeling I'll be bumping it up to five stars once I have a couple more visits under my belt! This place totally deserves 4.5 average stars that it has right now (a rarity on Yelp) and if you've been thinking about going, you should not walk, but run to this place! Edited: Two more visits since then and it's officially five stars. This place is freakin' awesome and truly one of the kind. I've also been told there's not another restaurant in this country with a sake list that rivals Sakagura's.

The food at this place is effing awesome. I love Japanese fried food - karaage (fried chicken), agedashidofu (fried tofu in broth), and nasu dengaku (fried eggplant with miso sauce). All of these were cooked perfectly, just as you'd find them in Japan. I also liked that they brought out the dishes one by one instead of just dumping a whole bunch of plates on the table, as crappy izakayas are wont to do. If only they had oshinko (assorted picked vegetables) and okonomiyaki (the pancake dish), the menu would be truly complete.

My friends and I were trying to follow Bourdain's foot steps in NYC....so one of the places he visited was in "No Reservation" (the t.v. show) was Sakagura. Gotta say I was very pleased. They had ultra tasty Japanese "tapas" and a great sake selection. The waitress was very helpful and recommended some great sake. Adding to the cool factor of this place was the hidden in plain sight aspect of Sakagura. Pretty cool...it made a doofus like me feel he was privileged enough to find this "secret"...a "secret" shared by 60 other people eating there!

Came here a while back so forgive me for not remember any details about specific dishes. I came for a late dinner on a Saturday night to meet some old friends who I hadn't seen in ages. The entrance to the place is a little hidden and it seemed as if the restaurant was part of the parking garage of this office building. However, the inside was decorated very thoughtfully with very Japanese touches. The waitress was super nice and patient with us as we ordered very indecisively. It was a special occasion so we even went for a nice sake recommendation which true to form was very good. Everything was delicious (and it better have been for the prices!) and I left a little buzzed and very satisfied.

I used to love the sake tastings here with limited seating and paired with food, before the tastings became so popular. ?I had not returned in a long time, but was looking for something simple. My father and uncle were visiting from Tokyo and Taipei and were offended that we were made to wait outside for 15 min (with a reservation), only to discover that the restaurant was half empty. ?Nobody left the restaurant while we were waiting, so one can not explain the wait on a shortage of waiters. ?They told us they were "waiting to clear the tables." My experience with this place is they are rude and rush non-Japanese speakers. ?We purposely spoke Japanese and got good service after we were seated even though our Japanese waiter wasn't very good at Japanese. The food is ok, not great. ?Americans probably like being treated poorly so they think the restaurant is a special place ("come on time, we can only hold your table for 15 minutes"). ?It's the same concept as queuing outside a discotheque. By being rude and rushing out Americans, I know you'd like to have mostly Japanese patrons. ?But any MORON from Japan would know you can't lie to us and treat us poorly to make the restaurant look good. ?My uncle didn't even notice the food. ?He was still remarking on our treatment prior to being seated. ? When we left the restaurant, we saw another Japanese couple waiting outside for no reason. We were offended and will not return.

so goood! japanese food + small plates + sake and beer = a happy stomach. I'm a big fan of japanese small plate dishes since I like to try a different array of dishes when I'm eating out and this is the best method taste a bit of everything, especially if you're up to trying new items. Their sake selection is expansive and there are pairing suggestions to dishes marked on the menu for you. Word of caution, the small plates are more filling than they looked, I definitely over ordered, especially the heavy deep fried stuffed potatoes. Great place to chill over food and drink and catch up with people.

I've asked to be relocated ?to other table, but they stated everything was reserved (they were empty at the time and could have relocated me). I've ordered few different items: - MAGURO YAMAKAKE : Fresh Tuna Sashimi Served with Grated Mountain Yam: This really didn't taste that good. -EBI SHINJO : Deep Fried Shrimp Balls Covered with Sliced Almonds This was ok. - HIYAYAKKO : Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes This was one of the worst tofu I've tasted. - Sashimi special: interesting - neo fish, salmon, tuna Interesting fish.

(this review is only for lunch) i was taken to this place for a business lunch on a recent wednesday noon. it seems really popular as the place was packed. but luckily my colleagues made reservations. firstly, i would not have known about this place had my colleagues not picked this place. it's located in some office building(?) in the basement. but once you enter, the decor is very japanese. we settled down at our table and began to purvey the menu. we decided on a sashimi appetizer to share and each got a main dish. i got the tempura gozen, my colleagues each got the kamo namban and sake don. the food was fresh, well made, delicious and served pretty quickly. the service overall was attentive. the price is definitely on the higher end. but i wasn't paying so didn't care. we didn't have any sake since it was a work lunch. for that location/area, the price is probably comparable. if i want to try to sake i'll probably go back. but there are so many good japanese restaurants and sake bars that i am not sure if i'll trek up to mid town just to eat/drink here again. of course, i would if someone treats =)

You have to know and appreciate authentic Japanese food to truly enjoy the food here. ?Don't expect the "Americanized" sushi, terriyaki, etc. ?The portions are smaller, but if you go with a larger group, you can try an array of dishes. ?Drinks are overpriced and if you know that going in, you won't get sticker shock when you see the tab. ? ?Keep in mind that the cheapest sake is $22 and there's no wine. ?You may want to enjoy the impeccable food and have drinks somewhere after dinner. The dishes are clean, exquisite, and perfectly seasoned. ?Sashimi was amazingly fresh and robust with flavor. ?All of the dishes were unique and tasty. ?The pork is amazing (with or without the yummy fat layer on top).

This is a hidden authentic Japanese IZAKAYA near grand central station. IZAKAYA is a Tapas place you mainly drink alcohol and eat small plates. It is expensive and portion is not big, but you can get excellent food. Service is always great.

OK, yea so my fiance and I after having dined at Sushi Yasuda were still a little hungry and wanted some more sake so we want across the street to Sakagura... big mistake... although the ambiance is nice and the menu seems rather extensive i did not find any of the food to be that delicious, although I guess it would be hard to top after having just had the best sushi of my life beforehand... the sake and service was good and the place seemed to be crowded with regulars so I think I'll have to try it out again.. I've been to a few izakayas though and wasn't too overly impressed... i prefer aburiya kinnosuke over sakagura

This place was really overrated. ?My fiancee and I went for Valentine's expecting an incredible menu of extremely unique and delicious things. ?Overall the meal was fine, it just wasn't 4-5 stars great like everyone else seems to think it was. The service was great and that certainly went a long way, especially on a major holiday. ?I loved that the waitress put a lot of effort into finding a great quality sake that we would like in our price range and then let us sample two before deciding. ?That definitely bumps my experience up. On to the food: We ordered 6 plates, two deserts and a half bottle of sake between us and our total including tip was $145. ? KAMO ROAST (Chilled Roasted Duck) - This was really good and a lot more meaty and hearty than most duck dishes I've had before. ?I'd get this again for sure MAGURO YAMAKAKE (Tuna Sashimi Served with Grated Mountain Yam)- The tuna had a somewhat fishy taste. ?Very mediocre GYU MISO NIKOMI (Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish)- Extremely delicious. ?By far the best thing we had. ?I could eat 10 of these. ? HOMEMADE " NIHACHI SOBA ?(Cold Noodles Served with Soy Dipping Sauce) - very bland. ?Tasted like the pasta any college kid would make, stuck in the fridge and covered in soy sauce. ?Extremely dissapointing SAKE OYAKO DON (Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe on top of rice) - The roe was really good and the fish was solid. ?It was missing something though, and overall was kind of a dry bland bite, ONIGIRI (Rice Balls topped with Spicy Cod Roe)- Another strike out. ?I guess i expected something more than a big pile of rice with some roe on top of it. ?The roe itself was very good, but it was nothing special We also had the chocolate sufflee and the black sesame creme brulee. ?Both were again, solid, but far from spectacular. ?The chocolate sufflee tasted very average. ?The creme brulee was a fine creme brulee, but not life changing like the other yelp reviews would lead you to believe. Overall it was just a very meh meal. ?There are so many better, significantly cheaper meals than this in New York. ?I can't imagine why I would return here again.

This is another one of those places that just does everything right. The atmosphere, the service, the food...it just all makes sense and leaves you so satisfied. Standouts - The duck. I don't know why I love this every time, but putting a piece of cold duck in my mouth that has been roasted to perfection, with a hint of salt and herbs - it's amazing. The sashimi platter. Holy crap, I've never tasted fresher fish in my life. The selection is always right on, from melt in your mouth, buttery fatty tuna, to briney uni and things you've (I've) never had before, like snapper sashimi. The black sesame creme brulee, as mentioned before, is out of control. It'st he perfect vehicle for such a unique flavor - that nutty comforting flavor whipped up in a pot of luscious cream. Yum.

Really amazing Japanese cuisine, not to mention a very comprehensive sake menu. Having spent time in Japan, I can recognize good vs great. This is great. The fluke carpaccio with salmon roe was phenomenal. Whenever I make it there again, I can't imagine not ordering it. And adding to this restaurant's allure is that you have to walk into a non-descript lobby next to an Avis car rental outlet and head down a narrow set of stairs into this Japanese oasis in mid-town. I went on a Sunday night around 8pm. It wasn't crowded, but was active. Sat at the bar and had great service. In addition to the carpaccio, I had the seaweed salad, pork belly (a self-proclaimed specialty), and ?one of the daily specials - which one, I can't remember, due, I'm sure, to the 375mL bottle of unfiltered sake that complemented my meal. but I do remember that I also really enjoyed the seaweed salad served with the vinaigrette dressing. the salad includes 4 different types of seaweed, each with a distinct taste, color and texture. And it's healthy to boot! ?If you like Japanese cuisine, you will love Sakagura.

When you've been away from Japan too long, you start missing the nights out at the izakaya. And this place definitely hits the spot. That's why whenever I go to NY, I ALWAYS make sure that I go here at least one night for dinner. Their KARAAGE (fried chicken) is better than my mom's (and she's an AWESOME cook!). Of course, their endless list of sake is also what attracts me here. Hidden in the basement of a bu idling, it may be a little hard to find. But, it's like finding treasure when you've finally reached it.

One of my favorite izakaya in New York. ?Authentic atmosphere, service, cozy and warm feel, and the fact that it's tucked in the middle of nowhere beneath a cold office building gives it a sense of magic, as if you've discovered some secret hidden place beneath the city. ?The food is superb, the sake collection delicious. ?My only gripe is with the price, as this is really an expensive place relative to other izakaya, either in NY or Japan. ?But thumbs up all around.

Wowzerz.... It is good. Yup, all four of us were happy. Truly authentic Japanese Sake bar experience. Its pricey but I thought it was all worth it. One nice big bottle of their summer sake and another half bottle, 7 things of appetizers and one entree portion of ?Kaisen Don, 3 desserts. The total bill came out appx $200. I was happy to pay for that. These are the things we got. Kamo roast - the best!! (nicely chilled tender duck roast, 6 thin slices) Maguro tartare - loved it! (portion good enough for 4. but i could use more of this.) Gindara yuna yaki - loved the buttery texture of cod, a bit salty. Ebi stick - so so. thinly rolled fried shrimp roll. also a tad salty. ? Jaga dango - ?loved its fun factor. double fun of doughnut and mashed potatoes. Tori karaage - nice big chunks of fried chicken. Tori tsukune - not my fav, but others loved it. chicken meatballs. Kaisen Kimchee don - LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! just about the perfect mix of kimchee and sashimi. this will fill you up as an entree. ? Goma brulee - good, but not as fantastic as how i was told from others. Souffle - just a ok, can easily get the better souffle from somewhere else perhaps. SAKE - the big bottle was $63, the half bottle $32. can't remember the names but both were delicious. overall, Id love to go back there again for other things that we hadn't tried. even w/ the reservation, we're waiting for another 15 mins. obviously very busy even during the weekdays. I can see myself walking in for their lunch specials one day.

My absolutely must have : daikon salad, chawanmushi (egg custard but only sakagura makes it like this), miso beef and the pork belly (make sure to get rice w them) dont bother w the sushi there, focus on the home style cuisine that's the moat special thing about sakagura other than their huge collection of sake!!

Sakagura was my first japanese tapas dining experience. My boyfriend and I were able to get a same day reservation for 7:30pm on a Tuesday - which was a score considering this place can be packed. I had read about the hidden-ish entrance so I wasn't phased by the exterior of the building - but my boyfriend was pretty convinced I was leading him into a darkened basement to kill him. Once we got to Sakagura and saw the awesome atmosphere we were both really excited. I based our food picks off other Yelp reviews since we were both pretty unfamiliar with this type of food. We went with the steaks on hot stone, tuna sashimi, tofu salad, fried mushroom and taro, the fried chicken bits, chicken meatballs, and one of the fish dishes, and of course the creme brulee. Everything was so delicious! Service wasn't rushed, the dishes came out gradually so we sipped our sake and were able to really enjoy our meal. It was a very cozy date spot. May seem a little expensive but we were out of there under $140 for a full meal including sake and a few beers. I've since been back several times for lunch and while the food is still top notch (and they have good lunch specials), its definitely a little more hectic with the lunchtime traffic from all the local businesses.

First off, I'd just like to say that the fact that I was able to order my entire meal in Japanese gives this place a true authentic feel - one I have not once felt in NYC (and we go to Japanese restaurants a lot). ?Now, from the attentive and courteous hostess to our very friendly waitress, even the bus boys - the service was impeccable. ?After being somewhat taken aback at the size of both the sake and food menus', I knew we were in for something special. ?We orderded five dishes: the hirame carpaccio (Sliced fluke w/salmon roe, plum paste, shiso leaf & olive oil) - amazing, light, flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth - the salamon roe gives it a tangy aftertaste. ?Then onto the Agedashi - a super soft, fried tofu, topped with dailokon and hirashi - very hard to pick up with chopsticks but once you get it into your mouth, all the hard work is worth it. ?The next dish was ishiyaki (basic translation is "rock cook") - this was AMAZING. ?Six small slices of the most tender, moist, buttery meat we have ever eaten - the dish comes out as a steaming rock and the raw meat. ?You rub this butter onto the rock (watch out, it steams like mad) then throw three slices of meat on at a time (the waitress shows you how the first time around). ?In a few minutes, take them off, dip them in the sweet soy sauce and VIOLA - you have the best few slices of meat maybe in NYC (much to my girlfriends dismay, I dropped one on the ground, the hot rock is really slippery - our sullen faces were noticed by the staff). ?Anyway, the last few dishes we had were the onigiri (translation: rice ball) with tangy plum and the yuba shumai (steamed pork dumplings). ?Finish it off with the highly recommended black sesame creme' brulee (thanks Atif!) and you have one happy couple. ?When a somewhat hidden Japanese restaurant in NYC is full of Japanese customers all speaking the language, you know it's gotta be good. ?I can't wait to take my parents here the next time they are in NY! ?Loved it loved it loved it....and that is all!

the sake list totally sucked me in to this place..and it totally reminds me of izakaya's in japan. my boyfriend which is a total sake lover was pretty happy with what we got. and even though we went there on the late side(around 11) the staff still treated us very nicely and we didnt feel rushed at all. the food is delicate which matches the complex flavors of the sake. im a fan of the hokkaido area's daijinjyo's and they didnt dissapoint me for giving me more than 4 choices in just that type of sake. i will deffinetly going back for seconds...

I lived in Japan. ?My college major was Japanese. ? I have lived in New York for 24 years and have yet to find a better Japanese restaurant. ?I've been here with family, friends and dates and each time it fits the mood. ?Every time I dine here, it is a surprisingly unique experience. ?Not only do I try a different sake every time (because I can - the overwhelming ?menu almost demands it) but the food menu is just as tantalizing. ?While sticking to the popular staples such as the tuna tartar and the jyaga dango (sticky potato mash dipped in sweet doughnut batter and fried, with salt as the only necessary condiment) the specials menu always offers something that must be ordered, whether it is jumbo oysters with shiso, lemon and panko or wagyu-grade beef that you cook yourself on a hotstone at the table. ?One could order round after round of food here until you come to the hazy realization that for the past three hours you have been in sake and food lovers heaven. ?And then you get dessert (Earl Grey ice cream, anyone?)

i loved every minute of it. it's tucked away in midtown on the bottom most floor of the building, so it's really obscure. but once you get there you realize what a treasure it is. it's mostly Japanese locals and Japanese businessmen, so if you are in the know you should feel special! very authentic, super service, an extensive sake list, and amazing food. we ordered lots of small plates and each one was delish. the only thing i wouldn't order again here is the fried chicken - i still think EN Japanese Brasserie's in west village is the best. but also check out the dessert menu - everything looked soo good! i got the sesame creme brulee - it was so amazing that i ate every last bit. the green tea truffles to take to go are also a treat.

i'm not a sake connoisseur, but if i were one, i bet i would really, really dig this place. so many kinds to choose from and on the menu they are categorized by region. my buddy, who is a sake snob, took me here and whatever we had was awesome and smooth...and cold. apparently, only white people are foolish enough to order hot sake. (hey, i am just repeating what i heard.) the fluke was paper thin and delicious. the green tea truffles are soooo yummy too---creamy but not overwhelming. the whole experience of getting here---walking into some generic office building and into what you think would be the parking lot---adds to the whole finding a secret spot vibe. but the cherry on top for me was the bathroom...they have a bidet! woo hoo! definitely make a reservation if you wanna check it out.

Around this time last year, my boyfriend who at the time was someone I was dating, took me to this place. I remember going into an office building's basement and being introduced to a cute Japanese village! If you enjoy sake, this is a great place to go that has a lot of varieties and a huge menu that lets you know all the different regions items come from! Since he had a reservation, we had the table for three hours and sampled many of their bar items! From squid in squid ink - which was tasty to pork belly (it wasn't for me but my boyfriend loved it), this was definitely a great experience. I truly loved the decor as it made me think that I had been transported elsewhere. This is a great place to go for a date or a girl's night out! The most memorable moment was that we had a sake sommeiler - you can also sit at the bar and enjoy the drinks as well but I'm not sure if that requires a reservation as well.

I read about this place on Yelp and after being intrigued by this "hidden gem", I set out on a quest to find it. ?It took a while to find, but it was definitely worth it. ?In a nondescript building down a dimly lit staircase, I found some of the best Japanese food outside of Tokyo. ?After being promptly seated (arrived early around 7:00 on a Mon), I decided to go with the Buckwheat Soba and Crispy Fried Chicken. ?I know this place has any kind of Sake that you would like (with beautiful presentation of said Sake to boot). ?However, I was in a beerish mood, so I had Sapporo instead. ?The food was FANTASTIC. ?The Soba were simple, yet eloquent and perfectly textured. ?Someone there really knows what they are doing. ?The chicken was perfectly prepared, period. ?To finish my meal, I had the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, which was probably one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life. ?All in all, the quality of the food at Sakagura almost makes me want to move to NYC by itself. ?There is a reason that this place can stay hidden and still do great business. ?It's definitely worth seeking out. ?It is just that good.

This is the quintessential midtown Sushi joint to me. It's hidden in the basement of a larger building with no real signage indicating the gem that is located two grungy stair cases below. Once in the restaurant it's a dark and stylish homage to Japanese simplicity. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I sat at the bar and my server made some great recommendations for me. I started with a bowl of the miso soup which had a very dark hue and had rich deep flavors that stayed with you. After that I had the sashimi dinner which featured 3 sashimi pieces of 5 different fish. Normally tuna is my fave but here it was the least greatest of the 5. The sea urchin was excellent. I also had the amadai saikyo yaki which was grilled fillets of tile fish. It blew my mind. If there were only one baby tile fish left on the planet I would hunt it down and catch it with no regrets and then bring it to Sakagura myself so they could make this for me and I could have it one last time. Overall an excellent dining experience.

My cousin introduced me to Saka Gura when I lived on the East Coast - the restaurant has the allure of being vaguely subterranean and a small sign outside of a commercial building provides a subtle "I know I'm good and I don't need to tell people I am" vibe. ?My recent visit confirmed the goodness of the place - an extensive sake list covering a large binder and several special seasonal sakes and well prepared, thoughtful Japanese bar food. ?For those who haven't tried this sideline of Japanese cuisine (which appears to be on the upward trend of late), it's not the typical sashimi, nigiri, and rolls, it's slow braised beef tongue, pork belly, grated Japanese mountain potato with tuna, fried karage (chicken), and various picked veggies. ?All delicious here at this fantastic restaurant. ?Some warnings: ?expect a large bill if you're going to sample sake (the sake recommended to me was $55 and $65 per wooden box - slightly larger portion than a standard glass).

this is an absolute must visit when i'm in nyc. i love this place as it has a real tokyo feel and the best selection of sake in the u.s. food is good to great, but it's truly the sake that takes the cake. if only they let you smoke cigarettes here. then i'd truly feel like i was back in japan.

Extensive sake selection! ?Try the sake tasting so you can really compare the quality of super-premiums. ?I love this concept of Japanese cooked dishes, and I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. ?I have to say though, I thought Aburiya Kinnosuke had better food. ?For sake, this place is hands down one of the best spots in the city. ?But the selection of hamachi in Aburiya gives them the nod.

Each time I go to NY for pleasure I make sure we come here for dinner. ?It's a hidden jewel located in the basement of a commercial building. ?But it's definitely a place I highly recommend. ?They don't serve sushi here (they do have sashimi); the food is more like tapas style that you share with your party, and you drink sake (hot or cold) with the food. ?The atmosphere is great once you enter the restaurant (even the women's bathroom is quite interesting - the facade resemble a giant bamboo tub and has a Japanese self-clean toilet). ? ?They do take reservations (for up to 12 persons) and I recommend it, however, they're really strict with their reservation - for example, for large parties they want call you a couple times to not only to confirm the reservation but the number of people. ?All the dishes are very good, even the usual Chicken Karaage (Fried Chicken) and Agedashi Tofu are exceptional here. ?Definitely leave room for dessert, and my favorite is the black sesame creme brulee.

I recently ate here with my girlfriend for our anniversary. Where do I begin? I loved this place! This place is a Sake bar and they serve pretty much side dishes to along with their amazing sake selection. The side dishes are amazing. They are beautifully presented and they are super delicious. We ordered the almond crusted shrimp balls. Best shrimp balls I have ever had. We ordered a Junmai Ginjo sake from Nagano province. It was delightful. We also ordered a tempura-style Anago(thats saltwater eel). Amazing! That was a little pricey at $20 tho. We also had a miso-based shoju brushed ika. Very good. Also, a sweet basted cod fillet. Delicious. Finally, Natto-Maguro sashimi. I'm a white boy who loves Natto! We also had desert which was a buckwheat bun filled with asuki beans accompanied by some green tea sorbet. Everything was delicious and the place was authentic Japanese. The restaurant is beautifully decorated without being pretentious. I felt as if I was in Tokyo! Big recommendation on this one! ?Oh, I forgot. ?I found out about this place on no other than YELP!!

My boyfriend and I enjoy trying new restaurants as often as possible and what a great choice this was! ?Although you may not see the restaurant from the street I think that adds to the excitement. ?Walking down the stairs we found ourselves in Japan. ?We were seated immediately and were greeted by our great waitor. ?He was able to help us pick out a sake for the evening which was a Shizuku-Zake (the presentation alone was beautiful). ?Our meal included: GYU MISO NIKOMI (shredded beef back ribs in a miso stew that was divine, EBI SHINJO(deep fried shrimp balls covered in almonds which were crisp and delicious), YUBA SHUMAI ?(pork dumplings), and last but certainly not least...INANIWA" UDON NOODLE from AKITA (noodles that were absolute perfection). To end the meal we had the chocolate soufflé which was also fabulous! ?Overall, this place for the hour or so that we spent there took us out of Manhattan and let us experience true Japanese cuisine.

After reading other reviews, followed the small sign to the office building basement where they are located. ?Well worth the hunt - best sashimi I have ever tasted (and I have gone out for sushi in almost every major town on the East and West coasts). ?Beautiful, large chunks of fresh fish. ?Service fast and unobtrusive. ?And, if you like sake, they have a whole menu for that (I chose their most popular and it was excellent). Not cheap ($55 for the 15-piece sashimi), but I will definitely be back. ?Yum!

Portions are very small, but I guess that's somewhat to be expected at a sake house. ?I would definitely recommend this place to relax and have some sake, while trying out many different dishes. ?Most of the dishes were very unique and flavorful. ?I guess my only complaints were the portions and the price.

Went here with my parents when they were in town and we all loved it. Was a bit decieving from the entrance, but is like a hidden world downstairs. Decor is traditional Japanese, high ceilings, a bit modern but without losing the authenticity. Tried a bit of everything: sashimi, tofu, eel, ?duck, sesame creme brulee. Great sake. Sake martini was delicious as it looked. Portions are a bit small and we left a bit hungry (there were 10 of us). Highly recommend.

food was ok for the price. ?cute place but nothing you can't get anywhere else. ?What really bother me was the service. ?We had reservation form 6pm they told us we have the table until 830pm which was plenty of time for us! ?from they rushed us from course one. ?we werent even finished with the first course the third course was already on the table!!?? after i told the waiter to hold our food he did it again with course 4,5 &6??!! that actually didnt bother me much its wat happens next: i realized i forgot to bring a cake i went to the cashier and asked her where i can get a birthday cake she told me grand central station. after came back with a cake she told me i cant cut my cake here because they have dessert and there a $20 charge for cuttin my own cake... u may argue how was the cashier suppose to know i wanted to cut my cake here.. well i'm sure a lot of people run out in the middle of their meal to buy a birthday so they can bring it home! ? i think they've been in the business long enough to acknowledge that

Sakagura is not a sushi restaurant and does not pretend to be one. ?It is an izakaya, and it is a very authentic one with an endless list of sake (the menu was quite informative), friendly and attentive service and the simple and comprehensive menu. ?Uni chawanmushi was very flavorful and was topped with a generous portion of uni. ?Onsen tamago was tasty and cooked just right. ?White fish sashimi with ponzu was typical but fresh. ?Coupled with the light and fruity dewazakura sake (recommended by the waitress), this was one of the best and most fun dinners I've had. ?I would definitely go back.

I went here last night with a large group of friends for their sake tasting and it was incredible. The decor is gorgeous and the waitstaff was very attentive, welcoming all of us simultaneously in Japanese. The sake tasting was very well organized and the variety and quality of the sakes offered was mindblowing! I didn't really have any sake I didn't like, and there was absolutely no limit to how much you could drink. Our large group ordered a bunch of food, and although it came out in the wrong order and was given to the wrong people (example: I ordered chicken and tofu and the salad with cod roe was given to me, and I am allergic to seafood) but we were having fun socializing and drinking and didn't care. The food tasted good and was well presented as you would expect at an upscale Japanese establishment. In my opinion, as someone who is allergic to seafood and cannot eat most Japanese dishes, the best items on the menu are their desserts. I had the Chocolate Sea Salt Sorbet, which is really more of a ice cream because it contains cream, and the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. Both were mindblowing!! I can't wait to go back again.

Sakagura is so close to perfection that giving it fewer than 5 stars is being nitpicky. I've spent a lot of time in Japan, and have eaten at many restaurants like this in Tokyo and Osaka. Sakagura would more than hold it's own in that country, and here, it is simply the best of its kind. The combination of exquisite food, a very well-chosen sake list and a lovely, comfortable setting is worth every penny of the considerable price. the sashimi here is fantastic - not a huge selection, but everything is top quality, and expertly presented. The cooked items vary a little more, but only between excellent and pretty damn good. The sake list is extensive, and well-described. Friendly staff will guide you if you're unsure about what to try. Prices are high, but within reason. Lunch prices are better, especially if you resist the urge to drink (I don't, it's a splurge). Japanese restauranteurs are expert and making underground spaces feel warm and intimate, and Sakagura is a great example of that skill--every detail works to make you feel cocooned, not claustrophobic. And yes, the bathrooms are nifty.

i have written a lot of 5 star reviews because i don't want to waste my time and efforts on mediocre places and my mother taught me that if i didn't have anything nice to say i shouldn't say anything at all (unless it's about dojo's). that's why i have only been writing reviews on places that i think are stellar. when my friend chris ?and i went here for the first time we both said "holy sh!t" and almost crapped our pants. this place makes me want to cry. i knew the place was going to be promising when we discovered we were the only one and a half non-japanese people in there except for one other group of two or three caucasian people. we were given a gift certificate here by our employers because chris won a contest selling the most sake at the restaurant we worked at. when we asked them to make sure the certificate was valid they told us that we wouldn't get cash back for any unused portion of the gift certificate. we laughed in their faces and literally said "bring it on". the food menu excited us but the advanced sake menu made us wet ourselves. needless to say say we walked out of there with stomachs full, with the perfect amount of tipsy, wallets with about $140 less in them each, and happy as hookers on payday. i have been back several times and the place never ceases to amaze.

got to the building around 5:45pm, when the security guard for the building said they open at 6:00. no biggie, we walked around the block and came back. asked for a table for two, but apparently since we didnt make reservations, we could only be seated at the bar, which was cool because the bartender was really nice and helpful, recommending a type of sake that went with our food (some type of ginjo, i think, and we had a carafe of it), which happened to include: buta kakuni (stewed pork), chicken meatballs, chicken karaage, maguro with grated mountain yam (it was strange, but tasty - the grated mountain yam is gooey), hirame ponzu (fluke with grated daikon), and saikoro steak. they were all tasty tasty, but as tasty as they were, i would have to say our dessert was the best - black sesame creme brulee. it doesnt sound great but it was effing delicious. including tax and tip, our bill was almost $100, but i think it was worth it. it was!

This has got to be one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. I don't understand all the good reviews on Yelp. I like to think of myself as someone who appreciates good food, regardless of the price but the food here is not that great whatsoever. You can find this type of Japanese food at several locations in the city. The problem is that the portions and the prices are ridiculous. You will get two small cups of rice with a bit of crab meat for $26. You will get a pinch of tuna sashimi for $10. You will get a bit of Sea Urchin for $22. The food will not wow you. You will leave hungrier than when you entered. I ordered 4 plates because I was told the portions were small but I had no idea they were tiny! In the end, I paid over $50 for eating food that could probably all fit in one small regular sized plate. I left the place hungry. It simply is not worth your time or money. It isn't like some explosion of flavors in your mouth that warrants the extra money. There is nothing justifying the portions and the price. I would rather go to more highly acclaimed restaurants that offer better food and better portions at pretty much the same price. I haven't mentioned the fact that this place is in the basement of a building, the service is lousy, and the menu lacks any and all organization. Do yourself a favor: Skip this place.

There isn't much more to add to all the rave reviews that are already posted for this place, but I loved it so much that I feel compelled to write a review. ?We started with the more typical, common dishes like agedashi tofu and chawanmushi--now, I have tasted A LOT of these two dishes before at various Japanese restaurants. ?But the ones here were just a step higher than all of the ones I have eaten before, even some of the best ones. ?The tofu and the egg were so soft, and filled with so much rich flavor that only a ?mother's hands can bring out- if you know what I mean. ?They just seemed to be prepared with so much care and love. ? Even something as simple as fried chicken was impeccably prepared- perfectly marinated and fried. ?Tuna tartar- ?a pleasure in both appearance and taste. ? Each dish tasted exactly like how it ought to taste- no funky mix of curious flavors. ? The desserts- the chocolate souffle and the black sesame creme brulee- were also heavenly. ? I am so glad that I finally had a chance to try this place. ?The place is so serene looking, tucked away in a basement away from all the hustle-bustle of the city. ?The bill can add up, with all the dishes you order, but it is not outrageous. ?Yes, there are some cheaper alternatives for Izakaya, but sometimes you just gotta pay for the warm fuzzy feeling you get from eating such pleasant food.

Last weekend I came here for a friend's birthday. ?After having a hard time finding the place (it's in an office building's basement..weird) we were pleasanty surprised. ?It's small but nice. ?We were told there was sushi but low and behold it's a traditional Japanese restaurant. ?All food is served appetizer style (small portions) because everyone is meant to share. ?I ordered kaisen kim-chee don. ?I've always been skeptical at ordering sashimi but omg it was out of this world. ? Other people had the saikoro steak, tori karaage (fried chicken), uba shumai (pork dumplings), surumeika yaki (grilled squid and oh so good), gindara yuan yaki (cod), and gyu miso nikomi (ribs). ?After all that sharing, we were given green tea. ?The tea was a little strong. ?Next came dessert. ?I got the green tea ice cream which like the tea was too strong. ?The chocolate souffle was amazing, one of the best I've ever had. My friend got the black sesame cream brulee. ?It wasn't too bad if you can get over the sesame.
