This block of St. Mark's is actually littered with small Japanese eateries, many of which also serve similar food to Yakitori Taisho. Intrigued by the reviews and the name, I came with two others to try some of the food. The service is brisk(don't expect anything great) their isn't much space, so prepare to get very cozy with your friends. The prices here are really cheap(each skewer is no more than 2 bucks) and they have a bevy of options(skewers, sushi, noodles, boxed sets, etc.) The skewers are very good and I could definitely see myself ordering just skewers. The other menu items are alright, and they are cheap, but they really serve to compliment the skewers. It's a great place to hang out late at night and taste a variety of good casual Japanese food. P.S. Also, remember, each person that comes with you must order $7 dollars worth of food, so for 3, that's 21, for 4 that's 28...etc.

I used to go to Kenka down the street for yakitori/izakaya/etc., but I feel like the last time I went it had gone downhill. Thankfully, my friend took me to Taisho, which has served as an ample replacement. I love the salmon ochazuke. I feel like I could eat it for every meal for weeks and not get sick of it. Beef meatballs are tasty, but I wish they had chicken tsukune as many yakitori places do. I haven't had their ramen as it's not the reason I come to this kind of place, but I've seen a few people around me eating it and it looks like a respectable bowl of noodles. Go to Taisho if you want to taste a variety of casual but delicious Japanese food. The wait varies on day and time--get there right before it opens at 6pm to be safe if you don't want to wait.

Ain't nothing but a skewer party! One of my home girls who visited New York during winter break spoke very highly of Yakitori Taisho, so my partner in crime and I made sure to dine at the small joint before returning to California. We arrived in St. Marks around 9PM, so there was no wait! There isn't a lot of space inside, so to make matters easy, the host told us to sit down at a small table against the wall in the back (not the back room past the restrooms). I wouldn't recommend YT if you're claustrophobic; even if you're not, expect to feel uncomfortable. I've tried Japanese-style skewers back in Norcal at Gaku Yakitori, so I expected each skewer to cost around $2-3. Not at Yakitori Taisho! I think the price per skewer averages around $1.50-$2, so even a bunch of them makes for an awesomely affordable dinner. I do have to note here that the skewers at Gaku are CRAZY DELICIOUS. I have never tried a skewer that I didn't like. Thinking that my experience at YT would be similar, I was a little let down. We ordered the chashu avocado (pork and large slices of avocado topped with green onion and sauces), and their signature ramen. As for the skewers, we ordered the regular beef, beef tongue, chicken gizzard, and chicken skin. My friend is not a very adventurous eater, so I ended up eating most of the yakitori... and I have to say, I really liked their chicken skin! It sounds unappetizing (as do the gizzard and beef tongue), but it literally melts in your mouth! The chicken skin from Gaku was a lot crispier and more salty, so I preferred YT's. The other skewers were all just okay though - nothing to write home about. Maybe it was because it was so damn cold outside, but our skewers didn't come out piping hot. Also, the broth of the ramen was too watery, so that made for another mediocre item. The star of the show was our appetizer, the chasuke avocado! The flavors of the sauce, along with the textures of the crisp-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside pork and ripe avocado, made for happy taste buds. Because I was somewhat disappointed by the skewers, I wanted to get an order of the takoyaki (octopus dumpling balls). But alas, they were out :( We refrained from ordering anything else because we wanted to have dessert afterwards. Our total came out to ~$27 without tip, which is a steal in comparison to what would be at least a $50 meal at Gaku Yakitori for the same amount of food. If the prices were a little higher, Yakitori Taisho would be 3 stars. Since the food is so inexpensive, I give it 3.5 (rounded up to 4).

Bf and I came here for the first time. I've only ever been to Oh! Taisho! so I decided to try this one out. They sat us in the back room that was like the shiestiest looking thing ever. We had to walk back passed the kitchen, through this narrow indoor/outdoor looking hallway into this little round room with 5-6 two person tables hobbled in. Not a great impression. The food overall was not bad. We got yakitori, ?okonomiyaki, tonkatsu. The meatball yakitori was !!!!!!!! (That means no words - too good!) But then my boyfriend and I got FOOD POISONING. I would've guessed by how jank the back room looked. Never coming back here! I'm Oh Taisho for life!

Awesome yakitori place in the Lower East Side! Place itself is very narrow but they do have more seats past the yakitori bar. The wait itself isn't that bad as long as you get there early but the food is definitely worth it. The chefs are nice and are definitely masters of the grill. One by one the assorted flame kissed yakitori skewers arrived in front of us and not a single one was a let down. Chicken skin, tomatoes wrapped in bacon, asparagus in bacon, pork belly, all smoky and flavorful. My favorite dish though had to be the grilled pig's feet. I've had pig's feet in bun bo Hue plenty of times, but never grilled. One bite in and I was hooked, gotta admit that it's going to be kind of hard having pig's feet prepare in any other way but grilled by flames now. Also gotta try their soft shell crab, such a nice crunch to the dish and then the hot crabby juices just pours on out and down yo mouf! Try the grilled squid too, very plump and tender for a squid dish. Must definitely pay a visit to this yakitori bar again next time I'm in the area.

I used to really enjoy coming here for its cheap beer and mentai potato until they sat me in the back room and I felt like I was in a dirty apartment above a subway station. Another couple was in the back room with us and they kept looking at one corner of the room. So we looked and there were three small mice running around. We ran out screaming and a guy asked us what was wrong and we told him there were mice. His response, "That's NY for you." Um. I'm not sure when being NY meant forking over dollars to eat among mice, but apparently the man and the couple in the back thought so. They really need to clean up that back room.

I recently made a trip out to NYC in the middle of December as a bit of post-finals/hello-winter-break fun, and before I went, I made sure to consult some foodie friends for their recommendations on the NYC food scene. One of recurring recommendations was for Yakitori Taisho so I opted to try it out for dinner on my very first evening in NYC. I arrived with a friend around 8pm on a Friday evening. It was chilly, but fortunately the wait was not very long (definitely not the norm though, this place gets super packed fast). The restaurant itself is rather small, and tables either squished in the front or back corners or along the long bar that makes up most of the restaurant. We were seated at the bar and promptly handed menus. Everything looked delicious to my hungry hungry self at this point, so I went on a yakitori rampage. We ordered agedashi tofu, salmon chasuke, and an assortment of skewers: chicken, beef, beef tongue, squid, shiitake mushrooms, and perhaps one more though I can't recall right now. The yakitori are cooked right in front of your eyes if you sit at the bar. It was fun watching the chefs cook the skewers, and the benefit of sitting at the bar is that the skewer plate is placed right before you the moment they're done cooking your food. All the skewers I tasted were yummy, but the beef tongue and squid were my favorite! The chefs also cook the skewers in a delicious sauce, making every skewer so flavorful! The agedashi tofu was delightfully warm and crispy, and it melted it in my mouth with the first bites! Salmon chasuke is something I definitely recommend as well especially for chilly, windy nights in NYC. It warmed my soul and re-energized me for the night. So grab your coat, head over the Saint Marks, and PLEASE make your way to Yakitori Taisho. It's a homey, comfortable yakitori restaurant with very reasonable prices (college student budget here...), delicious food, and well worth the wait if there is one! I actually went 3 times in my 5 night stay in NYC... yes that good!

I basically lived here in 2008-2009, my sophomore year of college. ?My friends and I ate here ALL THE TIME! We became great friends with some of the waiters and really enjoyed our time. The food is delicious, the plum wine is sweet, and the atmosphere is cozy and lively. It may sound strange, but you should definitely get the mentai potatoes. Basically french fries, but the sauce is DELICIOUS! Chicken meatballs or beef meatballs (whichever they have) are another staple in my meal as well as onigiri (riceball). I definitely recommend going family style if you're with a group of friends. If you're OCD or a fancy, pretentious New Yorker, it may not be the place for you. But if you love random varieties of music, cozying up to strangers, really lively atmospheres, and delicious Japanese food, you'll love it. ?It's a dive guys. I've eaten here more times than I can count in the past 5 years and I've never had any unsettling or undesirable occurrences. Only the best ^_^ I'm really bummed that my friends and I have moved on from NYC now.

There is probably not much to add about this place which has almost 800 reviews, but I will throw in a few thoughts. ? The octopus appetizer is really delicious, and I think it was the best thing I ate. ?Otherwise, the yakitori, cold tofu, fried chicken, and tempura ice cream were all good but not great, though the price is right--you do get a ton of food for the money you spend. ? The service at the restaurant is fast, but it is not attentive. ?They don't show much love with water refills. ? In general, this place felt a bit "young" to me. ?In that I probably would have loved it when I was 20 but think it is decidedly average now that I am in my 30s.

Came here for their skewer snack: 1). chicken liver (~$1.75) -- a variation of foir gras, probably fattening but delicious. 2). chicken skin ($1.25) -- my dinner companion liked it but I didn't much, guess the year of veganism really got under my SKIN, so I cringe when thinking about what it is that I am about to put into my mouth... ?Umm... prob. no more peking duck for me either. 3). beef tongue ($2.5) -- tender in the middle and delicious! ?** my fav tonight ** 4). bacon wrapped scallops ($2.5?) -- I am starting to hate bacon, can't even taste the scallops, the bacon is too fatty and salty! overall, good snack, reasonable prices, and the servers are all authentic Japanese ppl speaking the language and passing the orders so. We sat at the bar near the entrance and got a really good overview of the chef's work, he diligently making the rice onigiri, the other guy brushing the sauce onto the skewers while grilling them.. etc... next time I will try their Okonomiyaki and grilled Onigiri too!

Admittedly, we went off the beaten path and decided to try things off the menu that we normally wouldn't order. ?Lesson learned. We got the eel roll, grilled onigiri (salmon and one other), and okonomiyake and a few other unmemorable items, and they were all pretty unpalatable. ?The eel roll was not what we expected and we left most of it untouched. ?The onigiri rice was good, but there was hardly any filling in either of them. ?The okonomiyake was the best of the bunch, but still not something I would order again. ? Some of the more popular items we ordered were the chicken skin yakitori, chicken liver and grilled squid. ?Those were on par with what'd I'd expect out of izakaya. They don't take reservations. ?Our wait for a party of three on a Friday evening was about 30 minutes. ?It is jam packed in there, so expect to eat your meal with very little (if any) personal space. ?Halfway through our meal, three big guys were seated right next to us and literally squished my friends halfway off the bench.

Finally got to try this place on a trip to NYC after drooling over yakitori pictures on yelp for so long! We came here for an after dinner snack (our dinner was rather disastrous and unsatisfying). The space is small and packed, the front of the store is completely filled with only room for one person to squeeze through to the back. We were led to sit in the back area (would never have guessed such a space existed). Even this area was quickly filled during our yakitori snacking time. There are lots of yakitori (and other things) on the menu, the yakitori usually hovered around $1.50 to $1.75 per skewer, which is a very decent price. We ended up ordering combo A with 10 yakitori skewers, chicken, chicken skin, chicken gizzard, beef meatballs, and pork (x2). The food came super fast, skewers were placed on top of a bed of salad. The combo is offered at a discount price of $13.50, roughly 15% off individually ordered skewers. YUMMIEZ! Beef meatballs - This is the first one I tried, the meatballs were medium sized, flavor fully marinated but not overly. The meat is dense but not drying. Delicious! Chicken - Then the chicken. SCORE! This was in my opinion, the best one out of the batch, the meat was tender and juicy. Deliciously and lightly marinated to perfection. Chicken skin - This was really out of my expectation. Usually chicken skin yakitori taste a lot like - well fried skin. This one was so non-greasy it tasted almost like chicken, really really delicious. Pork - Another really great one. The pork are presented in a rather flat form, with lots of seasonings. The meat was made very tasty by the perfect balance in the seasonings, though not as tender as the chicken. Chicken gizzard - The less impressive of the bunch. But still, standard and good. The best part is, the bill came out to be $13.50 + tax. 1/3 of our dinner bill and infinitely more times delicious and satisfying. Don't expect 5 star service and atmosphere here though, come here for the yummy foodz.

Another restaurant that my brother suggested the family should try out. This restaurant is extremely small and is very popular among the young crowd. This place is made 3 people or less. If you have a group of 4 or more, just like my family, you have to wait 30 - 40 minutes or more since this place gets crowded around dinner time especially the weekend. We were standing inside at the wall mainly because it was really cold outside at the time i visited NY. It was really narrow and hard for the workers to walk through between ?the people standing at the wall and the people who were sitting at bar cooking area. Since it was crowded and busy, the workers and waitress and waiter manage to work really well through the business when taking orders and giving the food to the customers and getting dirty while walking through narrow path. Other than that, this place is known for their skewers. Their skewers are very cheap as well. My family order combo a, b, and c (since its has almost of thr popular items on skewers section), ramen, salad, kim chi noodle, and many other small dishes, sake and beer for the cost of 160+. My family thought that our bill was really a good deal especially the among of food and drinks that we order. Their food here was really tasty as well. This place is a good to hang out and order little things at a time. I thought the servers here are friendly and attentive. I would recommend this place since its cheap and the food are really good. And many variety of food you can choose from

Probably the best yakatori in the city. The chicken skin and meatballs are 2 of the best, though all are delicious. Ramen is also good, though not as rich and flavorful as Ippudo. Also, great deal on beer- 60 oz. of Sapporo or Kirin on draft for $12.50!

Really good no-frills late night Japanese joint. ?I was very happy with this place... EXCEPT for the fact that they were TOTALLY out of ramen when I went!! ?It was the only thing I wanted! ? However, I got over it and ordered a fantastic spicy tuna tartare, which was about the size of a baseball-- HUGE. ?And it was served over a bed of rice with a poached egg on top. ?God, it was delicious. The prices were fantastic. ?Beers were about three dollars, I think, and there was quite an impressive list of sake. ?We also ordered shishito, which were gigantic, perfectly salted, and served on skewers. ? One of my friends got udon, which was really, really flavorful. ?Another friend ordered miso soup, and it was the largest bowl of miso soup I'd ever seen in my life, and packed with tofu and veggies. My only other gripe was that the tables are so small and crowded-- but I sound like such a typical American complaining about that. ? All in all though, this is a very good choice for all those East Village late nights.

Even though it received a "C" rating from NYC's Restaurant Health Department Inspection, we went anyway because of the rave reviews and the fact that it was consistently packed (even though it is quite small) lent some assurance. Food was great - ordered beef skewers, mushroom skewers, tuna tartar, french fries, and steak cubes. Unfortunately an hour later, my bf and I succumbed to food poisoning.

I don't give five stars lightly. I was thinking of dropping a star because you can no longer order the mouth-watering BBQ'd smelt-on-a-stick of yesteryear due to a change in the NYC health codes. But this isn't the fault of the restaurant, and there is more than enough to fill the senses and stomach any time I have eaten here. ? Be prepared to wait, be crammed in a tiny table, and to be underwhelmed by the décor. There are plenty of other places in town which have larger tables and designer furnishings. ?Just don't expect anyplace else to serve food as good as you will get here.

This gets a five star review despite the long wait and the uninviting place... they kind of look dirty and unsanitary -especially if they put you all the way in to the back when they have no seats available in the actual dining area. Don't think you're going to be abducted, its part of the experience. Overall they have great choices for Japanese BBQ.. wonderfully priced skewers! Lots of different types of meat... order all of them with beer!! Service was fast and $20+ is all you need to get stuffed.. Well we spent $60+ cos my friend and I eat like monsters but you really do get a lot of food for a small amount of money.

3.5 stars and I love how late this place opens until. ?Everything here is pretty darn good. My favorite thing here was their version of geimacha - tea and roasted rice (although this was more like broth with salmon bits and roasted rice). ?It was nice too salty, piping hot, and Taisho used pretty decent rice. ?I always order this after drinking and on a late night, and it was indeed really pretty darn good. As for their roasted meats and vegetables, they were cooked well and clearly with pride. ?It was not terribly impressive, but very good and wholesome given the price point. ?Their beef tongue was pretty good, and they used decent quality beef. Come here late night for a good, wholesome, yakitori bar, when you are trying to sober up and do not want long lines and people hassling you and your friends from having some tipsy but deep philosophical conversations.

The thing I don't like about this place is the environment. ?It is not a clean place. If you eat at the bar you can see thick dust on the surface of the table right in front of you and your food. While we sat we can also smell some bleach mixed with the smell of the food. I won't visit this place next time. Nor would I recommend it to my friends. It is a good place to hang out with friends and grab a little bit of everything they have. The food is just average for me. We ordered some grilled garlic and pepper, potato salad, salmon fried noodles. The noodles had all of our credits but it is too oily to me.

I've been here a couple of times in the past but never left a review. Last night, after a concert at Irving Plaza, we wanted some ramen, so we tried Ippudo but there was 45mins-1hour wait (really? eh), so we decided to come to Taisho. It was around 10pm on Friday night, we were lucky to get two seats at the bar when we arrived. This place is COSY! Takoyaki - saw the man in front of my microwaving it, a bit of a bummer but it still tasted good and when I saw my bf ate 2 of it, that means is good Chashu ramen - love the broth!! Ordered the skewer platter A - 10 skewers of chicken/beef/bacon/chicken skin/meatballs, added asparagus+bacon and chicken heart - they were very good!! My fav was definitely the meatballs and asparagus bacon. BF ate most of it and loved it Grilled squid - very good i should try the squid leg yakitori next time, since it's a big portion for 1 person Satisfied my craving and loved it when my bf had no complains and ate everything we ordered!

This is my second time at this place and it's pretty cool. I mean hot, as in grilled meat hot (yes, I'm laughing at my own joke now)! Here's my breakdown on good & bad: Good: The grilled meat platter (chicken, chicken gizzard, chicken skin, meatballs, beef and pork) all really good starters. I especially like the bacon wrapped asparagus! The rice balls are also a nice change to 'regular' rice. Bad: The place is small & loud and if you're sitting at the bar~ smoky. Be prepared to wait (outisde) if you're going during a busy time (Friday & Saturday evening). Also, seating is tight so I woud encourage the ladies to bring your smaller bags (I brought my huge bag-lady handbag and it was tough to keep under my stool. No hooks and you can't use that bag-hook either). I'm giving it 4 1/2 stars mainly because I hate waiting outside (in the cold) but I do plan to return and would definitley recommend.

2nd time around, and I would say my experience was pretty similar to the first. This isn't bad for a late night spot but I'm not sure I would want to come here if I wanted really good izakaya style food. The breakdown: - Yakitori 3.5/5: ?Chicken skin, chicken liver, Shishito peppers and beef tongue were all good. The chicken with spicy cod roe wasn't. - Tatsuta Age (Fried Chicken) & ?Geso Isobe (Fried Squid Leg Tempura): 3.5/5. Can't go too wrong with these especially if you are drinking. - Ramen: 2/5: Stay away from the Ramen. It's not good. The broth lacks depth and worse, watery. - Yaki Mentai Onigiri (Grilled Rice Ball w/ spicy cod roe) 3/5: Whenever I order any kind of roe, I expect some level of saltiness but wow! This was so salty it gave me the shivers. I really like the grilled rice ball though. Shame it was so salty. Next time I'll get the one with Salmon. Like I said, good for late night. Otherwise just okay.

Yo, kill me before I have to eat here ever again. I would rather skip a meal and go to bed hungry than face Yakitori Taisho. We're trying to eat everything we can so we drop by to have some yakitori. There are no dedicated yakitori restaurants in Houston. We get walked back...far back...past a kitchen area...still walking...into a back room. We get SQUASHED literally between two tables. One is just a couple trying to go on a date. Now, I'm about 1 inch away from his girlfriend. The other table are a bunch of drunk Koreans. I don't like tight spaces. I don't like feeling crowded. I don't like accidentally poking another guy's girl in the breast with a Yakitori stick. Okay, I'm kidding that didn't happen. We order maybe 10 yakitoris. Chicken skin (WTF), chicken pieces (WTF), shrimp, shitake mushrooms, shishito peppers. I try to eat them as fast as I possibly can to GTFO. They're room temperature. The chicken skin is fucking awful here. Not that I've ordered it from anywhere else, but I thought it was going to be like KFC on a stick. It wasn't, it was like bacon that was unchewable. I'm swallowing back vomit thinking about it. Before she finishes eating, I've already run the .25 miles to the front of the restaurant to pay so we can bounce. We bounce. Never again. F this place.

This place is incredibly small and the wait can be awhile. It's worth the wait though. I didn't realize that there was another room in the back until I had to go to the super tiny bathrooms located in the middle of the place. Of course, the must try/have is the various yakitori. I wasn't too hungry, but I really wanted to try at least one: Hotate Bacon (bacon with scallop) MMMM SO GOOD! And the yakitoris are pretty cheap (roughly $2-3). I also tried some Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki...I don't remember which is which, but I remember they were really good, too. My group of 7 also got the largest bottle of Sake ($45). They have a variety of sakes, sojus, and beers to choose from. This was a great place to pre-game and have a snack before going out because of the atmosphere. I do want to try more of the Yakitori next time I'm around this area.

This place is freaking amazing. Ask your waiter for their favourites dishes and of course order the meatballs and chicken skin.

This place was awesome. We had the takoyaki, the salmon cream yakisoba, and lots of different types of yakitori, including the chicken skin and quail eggs. All of it was delicious. This place loses one star because of service, which was haphazard and slow. There was only one waitress working the floor on the night we were there, despite the fact that the restaurant was packed, and she looked completely frazzled and overwhelmed.

Love love LOVE this place. My fave izakaya joint hands down. It used to be a tie between this place and Kenka's, but as much as I love the enka music that plays at Kenka's, shoddy customer service there made Yakitori Taisho a staple. For all the people complaining about how crowded it is, get over yourselves. It's an izakaya - that's one of the things that makes the atmosphere here, and not something you can really avoid at this type of establishment. Admittedly, it can be CRAZY on Friday and Saturday nights, but when you've got sake and good food at these prices, and with NYU and trendy little shops nearby, it's something you've gotta live with. That being said, love the staff here. The servers are always friendly and engaging - sometimes if you ask them for something they may forget because it's so busy, but will gladly provide you an answer if you ask again. Sake is good, my preference is the Nigori sake ($12 for a large carafe, with about 8 sake cup servings). Can't go wrong with the skewers, they're delicious, the ebi, chicken, beef, and hotate bacon are tried and true. Some people said that the taste is inconsistent - if you go on a night where there's a Japanese girl behind the grill(she ususally wears a baseball cap and has lots of ear piercings), you are guaranteed a good meal!! And I really love the iidako kaarage - fried baby octopus are delish! They update their menu it seems once a month or so - one of the new items, an udon soup which had chicken and shrimp, was served in a spicy Thai broth. Was really good and a change from their other soups, definitely worth a try. All in all, yakitori taisho is a neighbor hood go to - can't wait till my next visit!

This place was excellent! We showed up at 10pm with a group of 4, and after a short wait we were seated in a tiny table by the kitchen. The place is crowded and loud, but the food was tasty and reasonably priced. The chicken skin is crispy and done perfectly. Kept the beer flowing and shared a bunch of skewers. Great!

Yakitori Taisho is always a fun experience, but the food is not consistently amazing. The salmon cream noodles, agedashi, and skewers of gyu tan, chicken meatballs, and uzura are all excellent. I think the gizzards and beef skewers can be a little tough. The chicken skin is yummy but makes you want to hit the treadmill right after. I wouldn't order the takoyaki with Otafuku right around the corner. It's cramped space, but loud and fun atmosphere. Beware the shishito peppers - I ate my first five just fine, and then the sixth one scalded off my tongue and had me jittery for the next fifteen minutes. If eye twitching and shaking hands is your thing though, do order a lot. You might not get that sensation on the first pepper - it took me 6.

Its after 1am and you are slightly hungover and STARVING! Its a hole in the well yes but you want cheap food this place is where you go! They have tons of appetizers like chicken on a stick, ramen an other entrees to choose from. Recently I came here I had the Ramen which wasn't by no means comparable to the likes of ippudo but it did the trick! Service is also pretty quick! If you don't mind the smell of grease and tiny cramped space check it out!

Ok re-editing this place because of my last experience. I'm always down for the hole in the wall place because that is just my thing. Hole in the wall place + great food is my favorite kind of place. Yakitori is just that. I enjoy the food very much here. My favorite is always the chicken skin, it is by far the best! Anything else you order is fantastic from their ramen's to their rice balls. Service is usually fairly good in this place. Ok now why I am re-editing this place. NEVER EVER sit in the back! That was my worst experience here ever and I have been here over 15 times. First off the back is really made for like 6 people but somehow they made it fit 14 people. The worst part of my experience this time was the little gnats flying around. Every person in this room was swatting bugs away from their face the whole time. Most aggravating thing I can deal with while trying to enjoy my food while sitting on top of someone's lap that I didn't even know. I'm not ruling this place out and I am not telling you to stay away. I'm just saying stay away from the back room. I still enjoy the food here and the service. Although it did take them 15 minutes when I ordered a rice ball that is just basically a clump of rice with seaweed on top. Taisho down the block is the same owners and cleaner. Next chance if I had to choose, I'm going to Taisho. I'm going to let Yakitori sit on a timeout for a little.

Staying on St.Mark's is a dangerous dangerous thing. Even when you have had more than enough meals for the day, you will be tempted to have more when you return home to the hustle and bustle of the street. A small narrow room, low ceilings, and simple furniture. We were seated near the back, where there were 2 larger groups. Upon some decision making, I decided to get a Sake Onigiri (grilled rice ball with salmon), and yaki unagi roll. The yaki unagi roll was quite unique, and it was a combination of the best of both worlds- grilled rice and unagi, with drizzle of unagi sauce over it. Each bite was sweet, and a bit savoury. The sake onigiri was grilled just right, with a salmon filling inside. I then realized that I ordered way too much rice. My friend ordered the salmon cream yakisoba, which was delicious. A white cream sauce, with a hint of mayo, plus bits of salmon and green onion. Such a great late night snack, right across the street from where we were staying. Oh, how I wished I lived in NYC. 14/30; 30 Days of Yelp

Whew, get me some air... I'm going back in. Most people think Japanese food is all about sushi, or the soup noodles. ?I'd say this place reminds people of another dimension to it, being Japanese BBQ. This place may be small, hence before ordering something that will stink the place up, be considerate of the other patrons. ?(I ordered the Grilled Mackerel, which stank the place up good.) ?Ordering up some grilled squid balls, chicken skin skewers, and pickled plum rice balls really gives one a tour of the appetizer diversity this place offers. ? No better accompaniment to good BBQ than Japanese beer and sake. ?They even offer sweet plum wine as a good dessert drink. ?You want it, they got it. After coming here for the past 13 or so years, this place always seems new and refreshing while eating the BBQ entrails of the common and quier.

I swear that I reviewed this once before ... anyway, love this place. ?Friend introduced me to it years ago. ?Yeah it's a small location, you have to wait a while for seat, especially on a Friday or Saturday, but the food is delicious! ?It's not terribly pricy either. ?Get the Yakitori Tei, which gets you 5 skewers, salad, rice, soup, potato salad, and a small of pasta in tomato sauce (how that fits with Japanese cuisine, I have no idea) for $10 (or less). ?Just a note though, it you choose skewers higher than $2, they add the overage to the meal (so a $2.50 skewer adds $0.50 to it). Service is great and friendly. ?I've never had an issue here. The only sad thing is the chicken Tsukune is no longer available :( ... those were so tasty. ?They have beef Tsukune now, but it's not the same. I'm a little rambly on this one, but the grilled rice balls are a good item to have ... actually there hasn't been an item on the menu that I've had and not liked. Anyway, go ... you'll like it!

Food (2 stars) -- meats for the skewers were on the salty side... waited over 30 mins for our 6 skewers and they were cold Service (3 stars) -- the staff is friendly but they never updated me when I asked how much longer our skewers were going to come... I go to St Mark's very often but I always go to the same places. ?This time I wanted to try something new, I was deciding between ramen, thai or japanese bbq. ?Ended up going here, not too disappointed but not amazed like I'm dying to come back here. ?Came here on a sunday night around 8, waited less than 10 mins for a party of 2. ?Seated in the back, it was packed and loud! Ordered: Japanese pancake -- hot and fresh! VERY THICK. ?I thought it was would be flat like a pancake... It was flavorable but only had a few bites. Potato mentai? -- thick wedge cut french fries came with spicy mayo and fish roe. ?Spicy mayo wasn't even spicy... this was O-K. but I did finish it since it was french fries! Chicken Chunks -- ehh... just like ordinary bbq chicken. ?not much flavor.. Chicken w/ plum sauce -- i like salty food but this was like overly salty! this was the only skewer that was somewhat hot Squid legs -- burnt and cold! are they supposed to be like this? I see grilled marks and they're burnt! they should be HOT! Meatballs -- even though they were cold, it was the yummiest out of all the skewers I had. Beef -- too chewy, again it was somewhat cold. ? Overall experience -- I wouldn't come back here, there are other similar places a few doors down.

Best.Meat.On.A.Stick.Ever - We tried about 4 or 5 (the chicken skin being the best). Their ramen was also fantastic (although I may not be a true ramen lover since the soup was not as salty as other ramen places typically serve). Portions were super fair for the price paid in NY. ?If you're here, its def worth visiting/drinking on late nights.

Yakitori Taisho may not the "best" Izakaya outlet New York has to offer. But it has been my favorite Izakaya restaurant I've ever been to. Through the cramped seating and the busy nights, loud food ordering by the waiters, all the languages buzzing through the air...the ambiance is the main reason why I like this place so much. If you really want something close to what you'd actually enjoy at an authentic Izakaya place in Japan, Yakitori Taisho will bring you there. Now as for the food. The food is great. Sure it's made quick. But isn't that how most street food is made? One of the main reasons to eat here is for the skewers that they serve at cheap prices. I've had almost everything on their menu and would absolutely recommend the Kawa (chicken skin), Bara (pork), Uzura (quail egg), Ninniku (garlic) and Hotate Bacon (scallop and bacon). On top of that they have another huge selection of goodies other than the skewers. ?The Kara Age (fried chicken) is delicious). Pork Spare Ribs? Yum. Sake Onigiri (Rice Ball w Salmon) mmmhmm. And there's so much more. Expect cheese or mayo on things. It's just the way it is. So yes it's crowded. Sometimes when you order a white rice, the waiter may forget after all of your food has already arrived. And oh yes, there might be that annoying loud table real close to you. So if you want fine dining and a quiet romantic night, this place may not be for you. Want to hear a server with a snotty stereotypical British accent? You're in the wrong area. But if you just got out of a night of dancing and drinking and have the munchies? This place is your spot to go. Just want to eat some good food and chat all night away, head over here. Want good food and on a budget, then you'll find it here. The mish-mash of culture is what makes this place such a fun place to go to. And although the crowd has progressively changed over the years it's still always been a favorite of mine.

Yakitori Taisho, I remember when you first opened, when was it? ?About 17 years ago? ?There was a Kim's video across the street at the time, when VHS was still cool. I remember nights of cheap nama sake, motsu nabe, yaki udon, chikuwa cheese, grilled sanma, peman, ika yaki....more sake. ?The food was ok, but the main attraction was the distinctly japanese, east village culture mashup under a namie amuro and sex pistols soundtrack. It has been awhile and I'm much too old to be waiting for a table among cigarette smoking Esl language students, but cheers I'm glad you still exist. ?St. Marks Place would not be the same without you.

I had the tonkotsu noodle and it was really good, I wasn't able to take a picture of it before I demolished the whole thing so my picture doesn't look that yummy so I'll just leave it out haha. ?It definitely had the authentic taste down in my opinion. ?I came with my boyfriend and he enjoyed it as well (he's white so not much on Japanese but he really liked it here). ? The service wasn't that great but that is understandable considering how busy it was. ?Another great thing is how late it's open. ?If I lived in NY, def. a place I'd go for late night eats. :) semibombdotcom for me! :)

Wanted a fun and laid back place to catch up with old friends and we found it! Mind you the place isn't super big and some tables are close to each other, so groups of 4 or less are recommended. Yakitori if you're new to this is basically grilled chicken on skewers...grilled EVERYTHING chicken...skin, grizzard, heart, etc. If you're not into that then the menu is pretty vast and encompasses things like ramen to rice dishes too if you're not feeling too adventurous. Overall, if you're not into the different grilled animal parts this might not be the place for you. I would stick to the yakitori and grilled foods. There's a reason why its called YAKITORI taisho and not like ramen taisho. ? We ordered the yakitori set A which included 10 skewers, 2 each of chicken, chicken skin, chicken gizzard, chicken meatball, and pork belly. Everything was well seasoned. My favs were the chicken skin and meatball. The gizzard was just too crunchy and not texturally appealing. We also got the grilled whole squid, the salmon in creamy yakisoba, and the takoyaki (octopus in dumpling balls). ?The squid was great and not overly cooked and the takoyaki was decent but I've had better at other places. The big surprise was the salmon in creamy yakisoba. I wasn't expecting a lot but the yakisoba was just on point and had this smokey flavor with the salmon. I'd def recommend trying it. Our bill for 2 people was like 28 bucks which is pretty awesome. Def a great place for some light eating if you're headed out later

The intestines were delicious. $8 for a pitcher of Sapporo. Tofu and pancake nothing special, pancakes could do a little more octopus. If you're not into weird food like brains and cow penises, I suggest you take your party or yourself to somewhere else. Awkward seating where your knees must be against the table and you need to spread them wide like you have a huge wang. Otherwise, this is an overrated place. Oh and $8 minimum per person - WHY? Spent $10 here for overrated nothingness.

Yakitori is quite dangerous to eat when inebriated. One, you might stab yourself inside your mouth with the skewer. Second, you might drop two pieces of chicken gizzard when trying to take it off the skewer with a chopstick to prevent said stabbing. And...of course this didn't happen to me :X But chicken gizzard. Zomg. Just gimme a plate full of that. And okonomiyaki? The amount of carbs and fat in that definitely makes it a worthy choice on those drunken nights. And beer? Duh, the best recovery drink ever. I've had their ramen and grilled fish before on a separate occasion. Skip the ramen and go get the gyolu ramen at setagaya. Fish was delicious. But probably something you shouldn't get when intoxicated. Those fish bones...

I love to eat and I like to drink. But more than anything, I prefer to be doing both at the same time. Naturally, then, I prefer pubs, pojangmachas, yakitori and izakaya joints--places that can simultaneously indulge these dual appetites. I've been a patron at Taisho in particular for close to 10 years now and the place has not changed a bit. The staff (which doesn't appear to age) is the same and the atmosphere is just as hot, loud, crowded and busy as when I first set foot inside this underground joint in the hub of St. Mark's Place. And that's a good thing because what makes Taisho superior to other Yakitori spots in the city is its atmosphere. Owing in large part to its east village location, Taisho just seems to be alive with drunken merriment at nights. There's always a great crowd looking to drink and eat and eat and drink and the open grill lends a real authenticity, similar to that of traditional Japanese street yakitoris. However, having frequented other Yakitori places in the city now, I have realized how average Taisho's food is. The skewers, on the whole, taste good but sometimes the meat comes out dry, bland and undercooked. It feels like they are making skewers for mass consumption (which, given the popularity of the place is probably true), and in the process they have forgotten to pay attention to the details. That isn't to say, however, that all of their skewers are mediocre. Their chicken skin (with that delicious glaze), chicken meatball and beef tongue are fantastic and highly recommended. ? As far as the other stuff on the menu goes, I always get an order of their fries, which comes with a side of mayo/fish-roe sauce that is very very addictive. To round out the night and pad the stomach, I tend to order one of the carby dishes like a yaki-soba, miso-pork ramen or grilled rice ball. They all taste pretty good, although nothing mind-blowing. Finally, I have nothing but praise about the drink selection. They have every major Japanese beer, a variety of sake and some special fancy Japanese imported drinks that I have never tried. In my opinion, Taisho is a great first-time Yakitori experience as you definitely get a gist of what Japanese yakitori is like and the food is above average. You also can't beat the great location and wonderful atmosphere. However, just know that there are other places with better food (Totto) and better value (Hagi), too.

Other than the lively atmosphere, pricing, and prime location, Yakitori Taisho did not live up to my expectations. ?Really cramped spacing, mediocre-tasting food and not very sanitary. ?I have no idea how on earth they are still standing because I wouldn't allow them to pass the health sanitary inspect (gnats flying all around your food, dirty floors, atrocious bathroom). I ordered the takoyaki (octopus balls) and sampled some of their ramen as well as cheesy tofu. ?Even the cheese-lover in me didn't like that cheesy tofu dish - tasted weird and its temperature wasn't hot enough, as though it had been sitting out for a while. ?The ramen broth was rather sour and flavors didn't mesh well. ?Takoyaki was okay though - slightly crispy on the outside and large, chewy bites of octopus inside. ? There is a "B Set" that comes with a bunch of different skewers of your choice and my favorite was the grilled scallions. ? This set is probably the best if it is your first visit here since it'll give you a small taste of everything. ?Drinks are really cheap, prices match the portions that they're giving you. ?Definitely more of a nighttime eatery if you just want small portions of food rather than an actual meal. Servers are insanely RUDE and frequently rush you to order and eat. ?Perhaps since they're so busy anyway, it doesn't matter to them (mentality that customers are plentiful). ?I am not motivated to come back here at all ... lively atmospheres and good food can be found all throughout NYC.

This is how you know I am a fan. ?When my boyfriend and I went to this place it was super crowded and they had us sit in the back room, where everyone was ignored. ?Seriously if you come here make sure you dont sit in the backroom. ?Still, the food was so great that I would come back here again. ?I loved the ramen noodle pork soup. ?The seasme and ginger in the broth was just delicious. ?I could have eaten just that and called it a day but my boyfriend was hungry and he ordered the tuna tar tar (liked it but it was cooked tuna), edamame (ok), and meat skewers (yum). ?I ordered a large diet coke and it came in this mug that was huge. ?My bf thought it was a liter of soda. ?So if you want a normal sized drink get a small. ? So in short: 1) dont sit in the backroom. ?2) Order the ramen soup and meat skewers. ?3) Unless you are in need of a lot of drink dont get a large, a small will probably suffice.

Maybe you can finally experience Japan... in this small, cramped hole. After all, Japan is known for having smaller versions of everything. I'd normally ditch Yakitori Taisho, or any other St. Marks restaurants, for their overcrowding but luckily, their wait isn't always long...especially if you're placed in a very uncomfortable seat. This is really a hole-in-the-wall restaurant; you don't get cozy here. It's not really a place to hang out - it's a place where you gather a few friends (or coworkers), chit-chat for a few, and get out. If they have no room for you here, Oh Taisho next door is pretty much a clone of this place. I don't think I have waited more than 10 minutes in getting seated, considering there's always large groups of people. I don't have much bad things to say about this place. I've had authentic Japanese food in Japan before and this is pretty much the closest thing I can get to it again. In fact, I have tried some dishes I haven't even gotten the chance to in Japan. The food is good - I always have to get the grilled beef. They are absolutely a must! I treat this place as an open bbq party in the winter. I don't recommend the pork, though - wayyy overdone with seasoning!

3.5 stars We had the yakitori skewers, and my favorites were the chicken hearts (so tender and moist), asparagus bacon, and pork. I found the beef tongue a bit under flavored, shrimp just ok, and mushrooms dry. We also got the rock shrimp with mustard (ok, but the tempura wasn't as crispy as I'd like), fried squid legs tempura (very good!), and the grilled calamari (meh, nothing spectacular). Fun atmosphere, food pretty good (not the best I've had), and cool neighborhood. The place can be a bit crowded, so be aware. I've had better yakitori in the SF Bay Area (Saizo).

Being one of my first experiences of authentic Japanese cuisine outside of Japan, I have to say this place was well worth the wait for our table. ?Having traveled there twice and being in love with the culture, I am always seeking out the sparse pockets of unbridled "Japaneseness" outside of the island nation. ?The hustle and bustle inside is highly reminiscent of a common scene in ramen and yakitori spots in downtown Tokyo. ?There is a loud, lively pub-like feel to the whole dining experience ?(to which a couple of cold beers pairs perfectly). The staff is super friendly, and the food came out quickly after we had ordered it. ?There menu was very extensive and had a great deal of quality items to offer (I recall ordering something along the lines of chicken skin, garlic, chicken breast and scallion yakitori). ?My friend and I sat outside, and while the fresh air was nice, our experience was severely dampened by the feeling of being left out of the fun going on inside as well as a large amount of mosquitos and flies congregating at the restaurant's small entrance (which is right next to there one or two outdoor tables). Overall it was a very satisfying meal. ?I would recommend sitting inside, preferably at the bar-like counter surrounding the kitchen where you can watch your meals being prepared with a great deal of gusto.

Me and two of my girlfriends decided to eat here for a belated birthday dinner. We arrived around 8:30pm on a Tuesday and the place was already very crowded. The eating area in the back consists of small tables that can only accomodate 2-4 people maximum. There's also a food bar in the front but the overhead lights give you the impression that you're being cooked as well as the food in front of you. Also, the downside to eating at the food bar is that you're right next to the kitchen so it can get hot and smelly. The chefs by the food bar were also very unprofessional, constantly joking and staring at customers as they ate in front of them, so we had no choice but to eat in the back area, which wasn't that much of an improvement. It was loud and cramped; not the best dining experience for a birthday. Our waitress seated us on a 2-person table because according to her, we were one person short of being eligible for a 4-person table (not cool!) It took her 10 mins to give us a menu and then another 10 mins for taking our order. By the time our food arrived, we were cranky and tired of yelling over the background noise to converse with each other. The food: Fried Shrimp Balls: They were crispy and savory, a little on the burnt side, but I happen to like it that way. The shrimp tasted fresh and delicious but the portion was very small. It was appetizer sized (6 balls) but priced as an entree ($12), and did not even come with rice on the side. Fish & Cheese Dumplings: These were pretty tasty too, but slightly greasy. I couldn't tell what type of fish they used (and was not mentioned in the menu either) my guess- flounder. They used Mozzarella cheese, which I thought paired nicely with the seafood. There were 8 small dumplings for $10. Overall, the food was pretty average and the prices were not as cheap as I would have expected, considering the quality of the place (dirty, wooden stools, etc). I won't be returning here anytime soon. Final Verdict: 2 stars **

This is a serious Yakitori spot. All of 8 feet wide and fifty feet deep, but it's jam-packed with customers from the jump. We had a 15 minute wait before getting seats at the counter for two. 15 minutes well worth it. I'm not a pro when it comes to knowing authentic or the best Japanese food. But, I do know delicious food. This was very satisfying. We started with a squid dish that was cooked tempura style. The sauce accompanying it was delicious. A well executed start, and it came quickly. We then ordered saki and a number of skewers. They came out quickly and were also spot on in terms of how it was cooked and flavor. So, what more can be said here? It says it's Yakitori, and it delivered. Every bite was great, and it was entertaining to watch the non-native, Japanese-speaking servers place orders to the kitchen. If Yakitori is what I want, I would happily come here again, I just don't know what it would need to do to get to five stars.

I've been coming here for over a decade and it's still one of my favorite places to eat. The love the ramen, the Skewers, grilled squid, frozen apple drink, and many more. They do occasionally add new items.

Good bang for your buck, that's the short story. Yeah I know this is belated but my wife and I were talking about it today and so I felt I should review. ?I'm comparing Yakitori Taisho to two other places in NYC I've been (Yakitori Toto and Yakitori Tori Shin) and keep in mind we had a limited meal here but honestly it was just OK. ? I went here with my daughter late night after an 8PM Blue Man Group show, its about a 5 minute walk from the theater. ?So that might have been the first thing that made it just OK because the setting was not ideal for a guy and his daughter late on a Saturday night. ?Mind you we are very used to cramped dining, having had many a meal in Tokyo. ?But we were led through the main seating area through a part of the prep area to a back room with about 6 - 8 tables. ?The room was filled with, as you would expect, a young Saturday night NYC crowd. ?And although I didn't ask anyone to sober up, calm down, etc., the presence of a 14 year old had that effect on the room. ?The guys next to us immediately shifted their language, the ladies on the other side quieted their voices. For yakitori we ordered one combo (I forget which one but it was the one that came with the quail eggs), we ordered hearts and beef tongue as well. ?My daughter wanted agedashi tofu so we got that too. ?This was too much food for the two of us late night. But for what I recall being around $30 it was a good deal. The age tofu was very good, nice big sheets of bonito, tasty broth. The yakitori was decent but not on par with the higher end places in NYC. ?I get the feeling that they know that yakitori is great beer food and that with enough beer the yakitori always goes down well even if its a little overcooked. ?The meat was tasty but as I said a little overcooked. ?This isn't usually a problem with the traditional chicken skewers but with hearts and tongue it makes for tough chewing. The tsukune was not to my taste either, the sauce they use was a bit on the sweet side for me. ?Probably good when offset with a cold Kirin or Sapporo but I wasn't drinking that night. I wouldn't say I was disappointed though, it was a good meal for the money we paid and its not like I can get yakitori anywhere in Boston. ?A meal at either of the other two places in NYC will run well over $100 per person so like I said . . . good bang for your buck. ?And probably better as a drunken night out place rather than a family meal.

I haven't been here in a long time - three years - but recently I wound up here at 2:30 AM, somewhat sauced and in need in food with two of my best friends. glad to see Yakitori Taisho is still awesome! at 2:30, the wait wasn't that bad. I was surprised. maybe about 5 minutes. we split 2 yakitori trays of the following mixes: 1) chicken, chicken skin, chicken gizzard, chicken meat ball, pork 2) chicken, chicken meat ball, scallion, shrimp, beef each tray is 10 skewers for about 13 bucks. the gizzard was the only one I didn't like; the taste was fine (I've had gizzard before) but the consistency was off. my friends confirmed that it was not that good. chicken meat ball was probably my favorite. we also got an order of fries with this odd dipping sauce: cod roe, mayo, and spice. sounds weird, but it's actually tasty! having a lot of Russian friends means I've had caviar at some of their parties; I just never heard of it mixed with mayo and spices ("sure, I hearda grits before...I just ain't never seen a grit"). for about 5 bucks, pretty good. oh yeah, they give you the big ol' fashioned steak fries with this - crispy on the outside and just a little soft on the inside. good to see some places don't just ride on their popularity but actually maintain their quality. I'll have to return more frequently.

Chicken skin was kind of a let down... it was pretty soggy. The star was the deep-fried baby octopus: SO GOOD. The skewers aren't the best yakitori I've had but it was good. Tsukune was good, I enjoyed it. I usually prefer grilled chicken skewers and they were great. I wish they had cartilage.

The space is kind of tight. The food came out relatively fast for our group of 5 ordering the party plate which had 30 skewers along with some extras. The chicken heart was cooked perfectly and so were the gizzards. I know some places tend to over cook the heart and gizzards where they become really chewy and rubberlike. I got the Calpico drink which was really good and not too strong or I just couldn't taste the alcohol. They have different kinds of sake, we got two different sakes which I don't remember but both were very good.

Chicken teriyaki was decent -- would've preferred chicken breast, but that wasn't an option.. My red flags? The scooped, super cold potato salad and the tomato-spaghetti it was served with... haha, I'm confused. Isn't this is a Japanese place? $8 for the bento box, $2 for miso soup/rice.

Ugh, we did not have a good experience here. The table behind us was insanely loud, I know there's nothing they can really do about that, so we opted to sit on the same side of the table so I wasn't getting an earful.. well... they told us we couldnt do that because it meant we were taking up 2 two-tops instead of just one. Uhhh ok... the place is not even near full... I kept an eye out and not once were there less than 4 vacant tables in my line of sight, which was not even half the restaurant! ? Anyway... I got a grapefruit-crush style drink & they brought the grapefruit in the plastic crusher and a glass of alcohol. Errr... ok. He got some brown sugar Japanese liquor. It was... well... It sat there untouched, I'll just leave it at that. Our food was hit and miss.. most of our skewers were good, but the noodle dish we got was meh. Service was slow and blunt.. The reviews must be mostly about their skewers.

This was the first Yakitori place I went a few years ago. Then I just kept going back and it never disappointed! It's a very small but intimate place. Expect an average waiting time (around 15-20 minutes.) Trust me, it's worth the wait! My favorite items to order: Okonomiyaki, and Yakitori (chicken liver, chicken gizzard, beef tongue, scallion, and bacon with scallop.) Deliciousness!!! Oh, don't forget to order some Saki with your Yakitori!

Came in on a Sunday night all tired from work, hoping I can relax with a drink or two. I ordered the B special, which consisted of a variety of chicken skewers. Pro: The chicken meatballs were really good. Very flavorful and soft. Cons: - Seating was very limited, and you really have to move your dish(es) around all the time so other dishes won't knock over yours. - The bar tables are slanted down.... Umm... gravity............ - The chicken skin skewers were really tough to chew on! I can bite through a lot of things, but I had to rip half of it off the stick and stuff it in my mouth. It tasted pretty bad like that! - Takana Tonkotsu Ramen- THE worst ramen I've had. Aside from the fact that I don't like ginger and there was diced ginger hidden in every bite, the noodles were chewy. There was only 3 pieces of char siu and they were pretty bland. - I needed the alcohol to wash down the taste of the food....... - WORST point is the flies. There were a lot of brown flies where I was sitting. I sat on the corner of the bar table right at the entrance, where water leaks right on your leg through the table. I saw some flies on the floor, some flies stuck on the glass of where they grab the food, some flies on the table right next to my food. I had to kill one because I just couldn't allow it to crawl onto my food. Most of the time i just smacked them away. http://www.nychealthrati… http://www.cleanchow.com…

Arrive close to opening time and you should have no problem finding a seat. Seating is tight and it gets crowded in here quick. Our server was friendly and extremely helpful. We decided to sit by the bar and loved watching the employees prepare our meal. I definitely felt like I was back in Japan. We decided to try a few Kushiyaki: Ninniku (Garlic), Aspara Bacon (Bacon w/ Asparagus), Gyutan (Beef Tongue), Kawa (Chicken Skin), Sunazuri (Chicken Gizzard),Yotsumi (Chicken Chunks), and Bee (Beef). Everything was mouth watering and seasoned well. My favorites would have to be the Aspara Bacon and Kawa. The Kushiyaki are anywhere from $1.25-$2.75 each. In addition to Kushiyaki, they also offer Roast Duck, Rock Shrimp, Salmon Cream Yakisoba, Grilled Squid, Spare Ribs, Chicken Teriyaki, Soft Shell Crab, Okonomiyaki, Soups, Noodle dishes, etc. Overall, we had a wonderful dinner at Yakitori Taisho and would go back in a heartbeat. Notes: 10% Service and Container charge will be added on takeout orders. Credit Card minimum: $10. Minimum table charge: $7/person.

YAKITORI!!!! This is a small place but the yakitori was freaking gooooood!!!!! The service was good.. basically.. I felt like I just entered japan.. I ordered a few yakitori, and a few appetizer from the special menu.. spicy mayo shrimp and the rice ball. I guess it was grilled with honey... and we also ordered some pork dishes... I was full.. and really satisfied with all the small portion.. One of my favorites was the scallop and bacon... and the shrimp appetizer!!! :) The price is reasonable.. not too expensive... well.. psychological wise... you will feel that it's worth it to pay it.. in fact is cheap and you get to feel that you are in Japan!!!! I guess this will be my YAKITORI SPOT in NYC!!! and yup.. it's in St. Marks.. I love coming to St.Marks!!!!

Got into NYC ?after a seven hour drive and wanted cheap, tasty unpretentious food that washed down easy with cold draft beer. Yakitori seemed like a good option and the vibe of St. Mark's Street seemed like the right setting for noshing and drinking. But Yakitori only checks off two of those boxes (cheap, unpretentious) and reminds me that service plays a huge role in a meal's success. Sat at the crowded bar and really dug the scene -- the street play behind me, the incessant chatter and noise of the fat hitting the flames. The expectations were high given the number of good reviews here and the predominantly Asian clientele. The service was slow and inattentive, but it was busy so I cut the kid some slack. Especially after he took a spill on the front steps (as the girl working the grill pointed and laughed at him). ?I ordered four skewers (squid, meatballs, gizzards and skin). I also had a grilled rice ball with bonito. My companion and I had to nurse our Sapporos a good long while before we got our food. The first disappointment was the temperature -- lukewarm to slightly cold. Was this not just tossed on top of a hot grill that I sat inches away from? But the tough/chewy texture of the squid, gizzards and skin confirmed things -- it was precooked. So there was a presumption that by waving it over the grill, it would heat through. How do you eff up skin? I'm not sure -- but they found a way. Hungry, I ate everything and devoured the rice ball which was comforting cause the texture was recognizable. After paying the tab and walking out - I wished I had just gone to Crif Dogs.

I wrote a review of this place about 2.5 years ago; considering the number of visits I've made since then, I figured an update was in order. A little background: some friends recommended I try this place three or four years ago while I was still in college trying to find my Japanese self. (I didn't.) I've been coming to this place once a week almost religiously since about then. Aside from two or three Mexican workers (that can speak Japanese!), not much has changed since my first visit. The staff is still eclectic, extremely busy and generally awesome. This is a great place to bring friends and make new ones; I've met some of the most interesting people in my life at their bar and have made plenty of fond memories here. While this place is known for their supposedly-amazing skewers, I've never had one. (This is a sin at a place with YAKITORI in their name, but I think I've gotten away with it by this point.) I only eat their taisho don. There are many others like it, but this is the one. I am confident that if I move anywhere in the world, I will come back to NYC at least once a month for this. It's not earth shattering and it probably won't make you want to slap your mother, but after so many years of consistent perfection, it's probably the thing I cherish the most in NYC. This is the perfect place to visit as a rest stop in a night of drinking escapades or a nice and affordable evening dinner. Get a hat from a few doors down while you're at it. (Pro-tip: The other side to this restaurant has a slight different menu and a lot less space. The food is just as good though, so check it out!)

Had the usual chicken skin, gizzard, heart, beef tongue (also excellent), meat ball, and pork. Can't go wrong with skewers here. Even the soft shell crab I would recommend with no hesitation. Open late but busy all the time.

I came here with two guy friends after a night of drinking on a Friday. We were able to get seated immediately at 1:30 in the morning so thank goodness for that. The men wanted meat so they promptly ordered some yakitori beef tongue, quail eggs, chicken and some beef with scallion and sesame seeds. I got an order of noodles as I was craving carbs like crazy. I had never had beef tongue before so I was quite shocked at how good it was. I even forgot that it was tongue as the idea of eating it kind of disturbed me. It was so juicy and tender and not spongy at all. The beef with scallions and sesame seeds was really yummy too and I happily enjoyed that with some white rice. The noodles were not my favorite as they were very spicy but I picked at them along with the rest of the food. I'd like to come back and try more of their food during daylight hours for a normal meal. Till then, Yakitori Taisho seems like an ok place to grab some late night food if you're in the mood for this style.

Food on a stick!!! Better yet Grilled food on a stick!!! We were lucky enough to be seated right smack in the middle of the bar where all the kitchen action takes place. The dude manning the charcoal grill flips the skewers every so often giving each side a nice char. We ordered the chicken skin, chicken gizzard, scallop bacon, shrimp, and a fish thing along with the salmon carpaccio and a grilled rice triangle with salmon in it with large beers. Everything was delicious!

OMFG BEST CHICKEN SKIN EVER!!!! (and I never ever eat chicken skin) Pardon my explicit abbreviations but the grilled chicken skin was so damn good. It was crispy and oh-so-flavorful. It doesn't remind me of the reasons why I hate skin in the first place (sticky, slimy, gooey, gross). My friend and I also had the grilled squid which was nothing to shout about. Bleh. Next, we had the Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) which was mighty delicious. It was actually pretty bigger that I expected but it tasted so good. The texture of the pancake was as good as it gets and there was a right amount of sauce/dressing so as to not make it too overwhelming. We also had the fried soft spicy soft shell crabs which was darn awesome too. The sauce wasnt too spicy. It was sweet-ish and salty and is a must-try. Also, the chicken gizzard and chicken meat on sticks were very good and yummy. It must be their secret recipe that makes everything so good! All in all, I would highly recommend this place to an authentic Japanese cuisine. P.S: Don't expect good service from the spectacled, skinny Japanese server. Rude and cocky as hell.

so, so good. the B set of grilled meat is a great bet, particularly if you're not so adventurous with your animal organs: raw liver, chicken hearts, tentacles, etc. the rice balls are dry on their own, but absolutely amazing if you ask for a small bowl of ponzu sauce and dip, dip away. be careful when you order - everything seems so cute and inexpensive until it adds up at the end - our total for two people was $65. oops.

This place is seriously crowded. I mean inside is always cramped and finding seats in this place can be serious pain. Got seated in the deep end in the restaurant and it looks really weird, sort of like a fallout shelter (really seriously uncomfortable and cramped).

The waiter was also really nice and helpful with the menu. 3.5/5

This izakaya is one of several similar places on St Marks and it does seem to be very popular. There is often a line outside but it tends to move ratjer quickly. The place is bigger than it looks frommthe outside as there are seats and tables in the back as well. The tables in the back may not be as charming but on the other hand it is further from the grill so one does not get the same barbeque smell (or at least not as much). Some of the food was pretty good (regular yakitori, the chicken meatballs and the chicken in mayo) but some were pretty awful (chicken skin is usually great but here it was to thick and drenched in fat, same was true for some fried pork that seemed drenched in fat and oil). Prices are pretty decent so not that bad but it seems best to stick to safe and easy things here as the kitchen does not appear to be overly skilled. They do offer the standard Japanese beer on tap and a few bottled ones as well. The sake and shochu selection is also fairly good. All in all I would say that the pace is fine for a night out where the focus is cheap food and beer but if one wants a good food experience there are other better places to go.

Yakitori is a great drinking food. They get the party started. They are small and they are affordable. Like a poor mans tapas. I got some tako-wasa and it was not too overpowering with the wasabi like I am use to. The agedashi tofu was surprisingly delicious. Great appetizers to the start of a great night. We shared a whole bunch of yakitori skewers. Beef tongue was good. Chicken heart was also good. The best was the Chicken Skin. The skin was crispy, but it also had this great gooey texture. Wish I had ordered more of those. Did not like the chicken liver though. Don't like how my mom makes and don't like how they make it. My friend loves it, but liver is just not for me. Add some saki to the mix and you got yourself a fun filled night.

Delicious. Everything on the menu here is absolutely delicious, comforting Japanese. The grill delivers tasty skewers of meat, the ramen is satisfying and the ambiance is bustling and lively. Last time, I had the kimchi yaki udon - not spicy, but plenty of kimchi on top. Maybe a bit too sweet, but very good nonetheless. Don't come here with expectations for a neat little Japanese place like a sushi bar though. It's more like the Japanese equivalent of a divey diner joint. Admittedly not the cleanest atmosphere and seating can be cramped... but honestly, in NYC, that's a pretty standard expectation. As long as you're not looking for quiet, romantic date spot, you can't get much better than Yakitori Tashio for hearty filling Japanese. It's got potential to be a great spot for a fun date though... and seating at the open kitchen bar is entertaining. It distinguishes itself from all the other dozen Japanese spots in East Village. Definitely in my top go-tos.

Do not be discouraged upon seeing the huge crowd outside Yakitori Taisho...the food is definitely worth the wait! I've been here millions of times before, but my most recent visit came a week ago after hanging out with friends at Vyne (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…) and we were craving Japanese food at 2am. Of course, we had to get the skewers (combos A and B), and we also got the okonomiyaki and pork spare ribs. Out of all the skewers, I love the chicken skin and gizzard the most, but you must try them all because they're all really good. The okonomiyaki is also yummy, and I always love watching the flakes move with the heat (if you've been here you'll know what I'm talking about). The pork spare ribs were surprisingly good, too. I've had other things from there over the years but it's been a while since I've had them, so I will be back to try the rest of their menu!

This has got to be one of the smallest and most cramped (and most worth-it) restaurants I've ever been too. If you are foodie that likes to drink wine from a monstrous decanter while listening to classical jazz and having your napkin folded and refolded for you every time you move - do not go here. If you would like to cram into a lower level closet sardine-style with 50 other people trying to find the waitress that is also playing hostess to put your name in for a "15" (50) minute wait - welcome! YT has some seating in the back (from what I saw) but the real party is up front, sushi-bar style, sitting on mini-stools just outside their kitchen area, which is nothing more than a grill, a giant pot where things are dipped, and a handful of burners. ?Even with that setup - they manage to crank out a lot of food rather quickly. We sat with the real party - I had a backpack with me from a day in the city getting things done, and it took up a lot of real estate - so try not to bring your luggage with you whilst dining here. Food: ?We ordered based on the pictures, as well as what we saw flying out of the kitchen while waited. ~Yakitori B - a nice mix of meat, grilled, dipped, grilled, dipped. ?Eat this. ?Note: ?The green stuff is NOT asparagus, but scallions. ?Do not eat 4 pieces, alone, in one bite like I did. ?Not as tasty. ?Chicken meatballs were my favorite in this one. ~Tomuyankun Nabe - tastes just like Thai Tom Yum Soup, except a little less spicy. ?BIG pot. ?Split this with someone. ~Yaki Onigiri - Grilled rice ball. ?We saw a lot of them flying out while we waited, so we figured it was a must try. ?It is definitely different - in a good way, so try it. ~Noodles - Kimchee Yakiudon and Yakisoba. ?Kimchee wins the battle any day of the week. ?Thicker noodle, tangy sauce, lots of pork. ?The Yakisoba was okay; I probably wouldn't order it again though. All that food, plus iced tea - 50 bucks. ?Super deal. ?I'm excited to come back and try something else - the menu is enormous.

This is where I go whenever I'm in the mood for cheap yakitori. The wait can be horrendous past 7:30-8pm but it's still worth it. My favorites are: Grilled squid, chicken meatball, chicken wings, smelt, bacon wrapped asparagus, beef tongue and chicken heart. Their ramen is decent but there are definitely better ones in the neighborhood.

Friday night and packed, of course. ?I had never been here before, and after being ushered to the very, very back, into a small room, got excited. ?Felt less like the western hemisphere, and more like the eastern (except for the loud and annoying pack of drunkards the next table over--seriously, watch your elbows, ladies!). We stuck to skewers and one grilled squid salad. ?Not bad but not great. ?The chicken was a bit dry, as was the pork, and the mushroom and asparagus totally bland, but the scallops with bacon, and chicken skins were the most flavorful of the platter, and the ones I would have ordered more of. ? It wasn't as cheap as I wanted. ?But a couple of rounds of sake will do that to a bill. ?I'll come again, eventually, but avoid the college hobbits and wait longer for a spot up front at the counter.

This place reminds me and my parents of an authentic, genuine, old school yakitori house. Yakitori houses, at least as my Japanese parents say, were in dingy, dark-lit shacks way back in the day in Japan. Yakitori Taisho represents that well, with a rather small store with small tables that you huddle around with your friends. So this is not the place to go if you want to bring...20 other friends. I would say bring 3-4 other people you'd want to drink with over some delicious yakitori. We sat near the entrance to the kitchen, where we could hear Spanish music overlapping with the old Japanese rock songs playing in the restaurant. That was a unique experience in my opinion. We ordered a LOT of yakitori sticks- tsukune, sunagimo, liver, shishito, the usual. It was really delicious and unlike other yakitori stores, all served together on a large plate that came. We also had some other appetizers, and we finished the meal with a ramen. It was delicious! I would, though, recommend that people skip the large entrees like ramen and just eat yakitori and small appetizers. They are awesome. If you want a different, avant garde experience for Japanese cuisine, COME HERE. It is awesome. And delicious. And as my parents say, very old school!

Great place for cheap yakitori. When you need that 1 AM beef tongue skewer, head on over. On my latest visit, I had the pork (good), chicken liver (skip), beef tongue (yeah!), and squid leg (nice and chewy). If you're hungry and have a large group, just "splurge" for the party platter that has a pile of Japanese kebabs for less than a night of Manhattan parking. The only oddness I noticed was our edamame, which was served cold by default before we asked them to heat our seconds. I've never seen edamame served cold before. Is this some stamp of authenticity of just an oversight?

Food - 8 Service - 7 Atmosphere - 9 Step down into an authentic, dingy, dimly-lit hole in the wall. Fast and efficient service, good food overall. Some appetizers are weird and can be hit-or-miss. I've been here at least 10 times, I recommend: Chicken Meatball, Scallion, and Mushroom Skewers. Also the Taisho Don that comes with 3 skewers, egg, kimchi, and other little assortments in a big rice bowl. Do not recommend: Jyako Salad. It's just a bunch of tasteless tiny fish.

Not really getting the hype with this place. Ordered a B platter which consisted of Kevin's of chicken, beef, chicken meatballs, and scallions. Also got bacon wrapped scallops. Everything was insanely greasy, not in a good way. The chicken meatballs were the best part. The prices are low, but the portions are also very small. I calculated how much our dinner for two would be, and the bill ended up being $10 more than that. What I assume was the itemized list was in Japanese, so I have no idea what it said. I would've said something about it, but we could never find our waitress throughout the whole meal. The fried tempura ice cream was amazing, even if it did take 45 minutes to get it, after we had to look for our waitress for at least 20 minutes

Taking one star off the top because about 5 minutes after we sat down my friend had a run in with a cockroach! Silly me - I suggested we move to another restaurant but there clearly was no way we were moving after having found a place that could accommodate 9 people at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Okay, fine, whatever - I guess we'll just call this place "authentic" and leave it at that. When I first walked in I had no idea where we would be seated because the entire restaurant is almost completely taken up by the long bar that only leaves a very narrow passageway for other guests. However, I had not yet seen the back room, for which you must pass by the kitchen, storage closets and bathrooms to get to. Small tables and small chairs makes for easy sharing/reaching across. You can order individually, but... why would you want to? Each person looked quickly through the menu and ordered a couple of items off the list and within about 5 minutes the food started rolling in one plate at a time. Let's see.... there was: -cucumber with red bean paste -grilled octopus -meat platter including beef, chicken, pork and various organs (NBD, right? ya right, I was not adventurous enough to try it. Mayhaps next time) -sweet and sour pork belly (PORK BELLLYYYY) -Okonomiyaki (i think that's what it was? "fish pizza" - when it came out i was turned off by the strong smell and convinced i was not going to like it but au contraire, it ended up being one of my favourite dishes... if i can really call anything a "favourite" over any of the others) -spicy tuna tartar -eel and avocado roll Man, I'm sure there were other things but i cannot overstate how good each dish was. Like I mentioned in my aside on the okonomiyaki - really cannot point to a "favourite". They were all equally mouthwateringly good and surprisingly all pretty healthy. I don't think I had a single carb in there - most things were grilled or sauteed, but damn did I get my fill of protein (no pun intended). Ya, you should come here. It's good. Close your eyes, point and order it, guarantee you will scarf it down like you haven't eaten in days.

Oh man, this is my go to place at St. Marks. I went here on a date. The date went downhill but I walked away with a new favorite spot. The bacon covered quail eggs are to die for. Litterally since it tastes like butter wrapped in more butter. So good. Other favorites are the spicy tuna tar tar, potato salad and the ever hard to find okonomiyaki.

The host, a loud man we affectionately dubbed "Mickey Mouse" (he was wearing Mickey Mouse ears), was quick to seat us at the front bar overlooking the chefs. All the servers speak in high-pitched voices, and their motions are quick and efficient. This is as Japanese as it gets. I've been to Yakitori Taisho four times, and each time has been a different experience. It's a long, narrow restaurant buzzing with college students and foodies alike. The back room is where all the action seems to be, but I like being able to watch the chefs prepare the yakitori. That said, the yakitori is okay. Not cheap considering what it is ($1-2.50 for each item). There are more exotic items, such as quail eggs and chicken gizzards, as well as your standard meats and vegetables. You can order a combination platter to share. I personally like the other stuff on the menu: kimchi udon, agedashi tofu, okonomiyaki, and eel over rice. They come in generous portions and complement the yakitori. They have an expansive drink menu (mostly Asian beverages). It's representative of Saint Marks -- loud, fun, predominantly Asian, and cramped.

The way they squiggled looked completely unreal and so unappetizing I wanted to take my companions and waterboard them for ordering the squid balls. Granted it was a birthday so I granted them mercy... So I sat there staring at the creepy little bonito flakes that were flapping in the nonexistent wind atop their nest of squid balls. They looked like what I imagined tapeworms would look like if they weren't in someone's intestine and outside squiggling and breathing and squirming and being gross. However I was starving and I wolfed them down anyway. Don't judge-- you'd eat worms too if you were stranded on an island and famished. Well if that's what worms taste like, please, sir, may I have some more? The food here is good-great. This is beer food at its best. Our party ordered a lot of the skewers but the standout to me was the garlic. Sure everyone looked at me weird but it was completely worth it. Trust me, especially if you absolutely love garlic. Don't order the chicken with roe, it was odd and dry compared to the rest of the skewers. So guys, I broke my bacon ban for Yakitori Taisho. You should do the same, squealing pigs on Food Inc. be damned (I'm sorry, I take it back after this sentence ends). So... we were seated in the back, it looked a lot like a room people would use for illegal gambling but anyway... The service here is probably the best I've ever had in a while. Like I said, we were there for a birthday. I brought a cake for my dear friend and they stored it for us. Despite taking more than half an hour trying to decide orders, not once were we rushed or made to feel uncomfortable. Everyone from Yakitori Taisho was friendly and accommodating, and not once did I detect a hint of fake nice (they've either got it down to perfection or are genuinely nice). When they brought out the cake it was pretty amusing. They turned off the lights in the room we were in despite other guests eating at the same time and brought several people in to sing happy birthday (and for this they charge 18% service which I gladly paid). "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO-- UH UHM." Then despite us taking a while eating the cake and talking, we were not given dirty looks or forced out. In fact, we were treated to warm smiles and refilled glasses. Great place, great atmosphere.

i've always wanted to try this place but never wanted to wait the line. today at 6 there was no line and they had outdoor seating, which was preferably to getting squashed inside, so i finally gave it a try. they have a large menu and most items are really cheap--but they do add up. food was only decent and we left feeling stuffed but the bill was higher than i would have guessed it to be. if you're all about quantity--go for it. but for me, i value taste over amount, and i'd rather spend my money somewhere else. the yakitori was oddly sweet. is that the norm in japan? no matter what kind, all the yakitori shared the same slightly sweet sauce and it just gets old after a while. won't be coming back, though at least i can say i tried it.

I found the East Coast equivalent of SHIN SEN GUMI HAKATA RAMEN OH YEAH, OH YEAH, OH YEAH....(gonna go on forever). Yakitori Taisho was suggested by a friend of mine. ?It had been on my list of places to go for a while as well. ?Seeing that it was open late, I decided to stop by round 10. ? -This place Is Japan-ed OUT. ?The chefs are preparing the meals, making sure the customer knows it's fresh and out of the kitchen. ?One of them is seen meticulously lathering on the savory umami sauce onto the yakitoris. ?Another is grilling up some yakisoba and carefully monitoring the Hakata ramen. ? -I ordered the Takana Tonkotsu Ramen (which is basically Hakata ramen with Chashu), as well as 2 orders of Gyutan (Beef Tongue) Yakitori and 1 order of Beef Yakitori. ?The yakitori came out first. ?DAMN. ?GYUTAN WAS MAD TENDER and peppered just right. ?Beef was good too. ? BUT it was the RAMEN THAT JUST HIT THE SPOT! Soft ramen noodles drenched in a hearty soup base with sesame seeds, benishoga (ginger), and greens. ?makes you think of the first time you ever had the REAL RAMEN. ? The place is packed, but it's all worth it; feels really like Japan. IF YOU WANT GREAT YAKITORI/ HAKATA RAMEN... YOU MUST EAT HERE!

A lot of great things to say about Yakitori Taisho. Affordable, delicious, large variety of choices, and it's open late! The food you get here will taste pretty much like your typical Japanese yakitori joint. Pretty much every traditional yakitori meat and veggie option you can think of can be found here. A few my favorites that I've tried here are the beef tongue, quail eggs, gizzards, chicken hearts, and shishito peppers. And if you're not in the mood for yakitori, they have some izakaya, noodle soups, and dons to order as well. Only downside to this place that it's ALWAYS busy, the seating is cramped and crowded, and the service/staff SUCKS.

Perfect location require good food...located on St Marks, East Village..This joint is pretty crammed, size of 2-4 is ok. Expect loud and overlapping conversation everywhere. Yakitori here is bland and dried. Japanese small dishes grilled should NOT be that hard to make isn' it? Not sure if its taking too long from grilling station to our table, that over cook our food or just bad griller they have. Our group did NOT enjoy much of this meal and was disappointed with such long wait. Go FIND for a better location to go, NOT here!

This place is awesome. Yes.. it is cramped inside and it doesn't open till 6pm. But the regular small line outside speaks for the popularity of this place. There are a large variety of small dishes, a mix between curious (chicken hearts, quail eggs) and just plain delicious. I think the name means "meat on sticks" or something, I could be totally wrong. But everything is great here. The tables are small and the food comes out piping hot, fast and furious. So you're gonna have to eat fast and make room. With such a wide selection it's easy to over order. I can never help myself. I'd definitely recommend the Creamy Salmon Noodles.. they are just decadent. I'd recommend other things.. but just too many .. too too many to even attempt to mention. Oh.. I forgot to mention.. this place was so popular.. that I think they bought the space one store over and opened up shop there too. Just adds to the awesome quirkiness of this place.

My current obsession at the moment is yakitori and it all began here! My bf and I were craving okonomiyaki and I'm so thankful for yelp to have found this place. Okonomiyaki is a bit harder to come by in California. Small, hole-in-the-wall establishment. Seriously, you are sitting super close to the next table. Although they do have an extra room in the back for additional seating. But you might as well introduce yourself to the strangers next to you. :P Ordered the okonomiyaki, yakitori combo A and a grilled salmon onigri. The okonomiyaki was delish. There was a bit too much sauce for me, but you could tell the seafood in it was pretty fresh and it came to table piping hot. The portion size was good too. Great start to the meal. The yakitori combo came with pork belly (love!), chicken, chicken meat balls, chicken skin, and chicken gizzard. All of it was super delicious!!! And the ponzu sauce on the bottom was delectable too. I wanted to dip everything in it. Love! I also loved that there was 2 skewers of everything so my bf and I try each! After sooo much food, the onigri was next. I was stuffed! It was really dense, had a small filling of salmon and it was good, but paled in comparison to the deliciousness of the okonomiyaki and yakitori. Loved this place. Good price, food, and portion size! Best meal in NYC. =)

Yakitori Taisho. ?Where dreams come true. ? Any of the yakitoris wrapped in bacon are BANGIN'. ?I don't know what their brushing on these grilled pieces of heaven, but I think it's laced with crack. ?And at under $3 a piece, it's a small price to pay for heaven in your mouth (THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID), but it adds up quickly (like when you order seven....as a side dish). ? The avocado with roast pork is salty DELICIOUSNESS. The salty pork pairs fantastically with the smooth, creamy avocado and it was gone in a flash from my table. ? The kimchee soba is a lot better than the straight up kimchee with pork for some reason. ?The salmon cream yakisoba is a little on the rich side, but it's totally balanced out with the aforementioned yakatori of chicken skin and bacon wrapped scallops. ?That makes no sense. The grilled rice ball with salmon makes me feel like I'm on an episode of pokemon (remember? ?They ate rice balls all the time?) and is fantastic. ?Crispy rice that's soft on the inside and full of salmon! ?Yes please. The grilled squid is just alright. ?Kinda chewy. The pork belly is decadent and in a sticky sauce that cuts the fatiness wonderfully. Service is eh (lost a star) but beer pitchers are $12.50!

YAKITORI !!!! Taisho ! I have too many things to say about Yakitori Taisho, I don't even know where to start... Maybe with its delicious yakitori which has no rival, only if one were to fly to japan would the find yakitori this delicious. Or maybe i should talk about their amazing appetizers like the tuna avocado salad, or the okinomiyaki. I think ill start with the large assortment of Japanese Beers available. Yebisu, Kirin, Orion, Sapporo, and Asahi. many of these are not known to the US unless one frequents these kind of spots especially yebisu and orion. I love how they have these available and how large the bottles/cans/drafts are. put this wide assortment together with some amazingly cooked yakitori and you got yourself a good night. I don't how to put Yakitori Taisho into a review that has less then 102849175917598739571935719385791 words so ill just simply say... Try it yourself and you have the exact 102849175917598739571935719385791 words at the tip of your tongue.

Love this place... After getting engaged, where else to go celebrate than to my favorite Japanese place. Came around 10pm on a Sunday. The wait wasn't bad, about 5 minutes. We got two stools in front of the cooks, perfect. Had a variety of things off ?the menu. Started with the baby octopus, tender and flavorful made it great. Meatballs, chicken gizzards, chicken hearts, shrimp, bacon-wrapped scallops, were all good. The stand out dishes would have to be the pork spare ribs and the tuna avocado salad. The meaty ribs which come in two huge portions were in a slightly sweet marinade that made it delicious. The salad which consist of nice chucks of tuna sashmi and avocado with a dressing was also great. ? Spot has a nice, laid-back, cool vibe.This place is hugely popular in a small space which means constantly packed in confine quarters. But always worth it. An izakaya that has good food, a good atmosphere, and all at a modest price. One of my favorite spots. Couldn't ask for a better place to share a special moment. Go!!!

Tucked away in a narrow storefront on St Marks Place is a gem of a Japanese restaurant, called Yakitori Taisho. ? We went with a group of five people for dinner on a busy Saturday night. ?I was worried, given the size of the place, that they would not be able to fit all of us. ?However, after a short wait, we all crammed ourselves around a small table. ?The space was crowded, packed, lively... a nice break from the usual dining experience. ?We got some saki (no idea what kind) and began ordering a raft of stuff from the menu that looked more like Japanese comic book than a dinner menu. ?Fantastic stuff. The pace of our dinner was frenetic, the service was hectic, the food was eclectic. ? We enjoyed every minute of it.

I am never ordering okonomiyaki ... ever ... again. It's like tart and savory, sweet and really salty at the same time. It's mushy too. The only good part about it was that the bonito leaves were moving so it looked like my okonomikyaki was .. alive. It was somewhat entertaining. So we bought a bunch of skewers and the only one I really liked were the chicken hearts. Quail eggs were hard (how do you screw that up?), beef was super chewy and flavorless, and the chicken with the tart plum sauce was charred ... I don't like black and burnt grill marks. My friend said he really liked the chicken with plum sauce but he's a freak of nature who loves all things sour. The skewers were tiny, but I expected it. With prices like $1.75 for a skewer, I didn't expect anything big. I liked how cozy the joint was. Super small and the bar seats are the best. It's fun but service can be a little slow. Oh, and their agedashi tofu is probably the best I've ever had. Amazing stuff. I'm going to give this place another try, I'll probably order different stuff and stay away from that okonomiyaki.

My foodie tendencies are largely influenced by places I've lived in or cities I've visited. This is why I get a hankering for Pinoy comfort food, Japanese street food, great gelato, and lots and lots of Spanish cooking. The izakaya experience was something I was initiated into by one of my childhood friend's family in Japan. In those days my family was living near Kobe and one of our close family friends was a fellow third culture family originally from Korea. They introduced us to Korean BBQ and introduced me to horse back riding and the izakaya. Granted, I was too young for the full experience but I loved the simple yet umami-filled bar food. Here in New York I was thrilled to find the izakaya-lined St. Marks in the village and Taisho quickly became one of my favorite haunts. The two bars are within a stone's throw away from each other but you're more likely to have a shorter wait at Oh Taisho. In any case, my favorite time to come here is right after work when the place is still relatively not crowded or during the wee hours of the morning when I'm in need of some post-drinking grub. Izakayas are best enjoyed with a mid-sized group. Otherwise, come hungry. If you are with a group then order a pitcher of beer or a bottle of sake. Then try out the different kinds of yakitori. Yakitori or grilled chicken skewers can be anything from tender bites of chicken to scrumptious chicken meatballs to crispy chicken skin. For the more adventurous order chicken liver, hearts, gizzards or beef tongue. Grilled shrimp, scallops wrapped in bacon, and some grilled vegetables are also on the menu. Have fun and try everything! As for the rest of the menu, the grilled squid is delicious and a must-try and the grilled onigiri are great to have in case you feel like you'll overdose on meat. Gyoza is also available as well as takoyaki and noodles but for those I prefer Otafuku and Ippudo. The staff is friendly and service is prompt. The atmosphere is definitely that of a younger and louder crowd but it's a fun spot if you're in the mood for some cheap eating and drinking.

I came here once very late night with a large group of people. We ordered a ton of food to share. The highlights: kimchi yakiudon and this noodle dish w/ salmon in a cream sauce (I can't find it on the menu online). YUM! A bit on the greasy side, but so good after drinking. The menu is so extensive that it'd be virtually impossible not to find something you'd like. I definitely recommend this place! -L.

Service can be really bad here. I went to this place twice and will never come again. The first time I got good food and decent service. The second time one male waiter asked to see my ID for drinks and then he accused me of using a fake ID. I always use my driver license from home country for the purpose of car rental and ID check. I never encountered any problem in the two years I am here. This guy was very rude, arrogant and refused to let us talk to his manager. It was an absolute insult when he said that my ID could be faked.

I can't say I've ever had a bad, or expensive, meal here. ?Everything from the skewers, to their soups, to their random appetizers. ?And cheap pitchers and a decent sake list. If you come at primetime (after 7:30pm on a Th, Fr, Sat), expect a wait, a really long one if you're with a big group. There is a sister restaurant next door with basically the same food. Favorites include: chicken meatball skewers, grilled cod roe rice balls, even their ramen is tasty. ?So many menu items here that I can't list them all.

I've only been here once and the food was decent however, our seating arrangements weren't ideal. ?We were given seats in the small back room and my bf and i were in between two couples (one couple on the left and one couple on the right). ?We couldn't even talk amongst ourselves without hearing our neighbors' conversations as well. ?The food was okay but getting service was hard (especially since we were seated all the way in the back in a small room). ?The waitstaff wouldn't know you needed anything unless you actually got up and walked out to the main restaurant. ?However, i hope to revisit in hopes to get a better experience overall.

I've eaten dinners at Yakitori Taisho more than I have anywhere else since I've been living in New York. This place is phenomenal. Mmm, two words "Taisho don!" which comes with a bowl of miso soup and a giant bowl of rice covered with a delicious bed of sweet egg and three yakitori skewers. The powerful flavor is so. damn. good. and just might knock you out. They specialize in yakitori, of course, but they also have a more diverse menu including ramen and bento plates. I've also had the yummy taikoro steak, tried a bit of the salmon cream yakisoba, which is also great and very flavorful, but when I'm starving and I really need something to fill me, the Taisho Don is the way to go. This place has a cozy, intimate feel and is perfect to go with a small group. Don't knock this place and give it crappy reviews because you're expecting some elitist 5 star restaurant! If you're expecting a 5 star restaurant, go to a 5 star restaurant. Anyway, people should learn to be more open minded to hole in the wall places like this with delicious food. The best table is the outdoor table at the front entrance! Share some Kirin, some laughs and enjoy the great food and vibe.

Yakitori Taisho is always crowded and packed. I've been here a few times and there are always lines. That's why I always come here before they open at 6PM to get seats first and not have to wait later on for people to finish eating to get seats. You usually get seated in cramped space because the tables are so close together in the front. Otherwise you seated at the bar and I don't like to sit there. That's where all the chefs cook. It might be interesting to watch I guess. I just don't like how hot it would get there. Yes, get your typical ramen with pork. It's pretty good. Better than your average ramen spot. They have other types of food, but I don't think I've tried them. And they have beer like Sapporo. It is also a bit noisy at times because of all the people there.

They should probably stop serving ramen altogether. While the broth is decent and carries some rich pork fat flavor, the chasu itself and noodles were both huge disappointments. In regards to the pork I was a bit shocked as they had kurobuta on the menu elsewhere so my expectation was for far more tender and fatty cutlets than what I found inside the bowl. The noodles were thin and lifeless, even though they did not seem over cooked. Just entirely the wrong type for ramen. Bummer. The skewers were ok but nothing of note and easily trumped by other yakitori places you've already been or will go to in the future. Plus I was a bit surprised at the 'A' rating after observing some of their handling and storage techniques. This place is probably at its best when you have a small group and some liquor in your bellies, but otherwise isn't worth forgoing better dining options you may be considering.

The atmosphere here is perfect for college students and those in their early 20s. I used to enjoy hanging out in St. Marks and the two sister chains "Yakitori Taisho" and "Oh! Taisho," but now that I'm older I'd like to go somewhere more quiet and with less wait time, please. ?The wait here is a dread, especially during winter. This place is too hectic and loud. But, they do have their share of delicious cheap comfort food and yakitori. Order the most disgusting sounding parts of the animal and you're good to go. As for other selections, I usually go with their pollk egg pasta, fries with house mayo sauce, and their kimchee udon pasta. paired with hot sake and Asahi beer, of course. For a more upscale Yakitori experience, I recommend Yakitori totto.

I used to be in love with this place 6 or 7 years ago. There is nothing like tucking into its cozy warmth on a snowy winter evening, especially mid-week when it is not ridiculously crowded. But, like all things great in the city, with an increase in popularity has come a decrease in food quality, service, and ability to actually even get a seat. I tried to give it a shot again tonight. There were about 10 million people waiting outside at 7:00 PM. The large group table in front had 3 adults, 3 kids about 6 years old, and a frickin' baby. Huh. Oh well, so the whole city is Park Slope now. I need to learn to just deal with it. I will say the food and atmosphere are as close as you will get to a hole-in-the-wall Tokyo joint without an overnight plane ride. If you can go on an off day, or don't mind a wait, you should definitely experience this place. If the guidebook crowd annoys you, though, you may want to try Oh! Taisho a couple of doors down. Same owner, same food, same staff, and filled with Japanese diners, not tourists. One tip: If you want a deal on skewers, check out the "Yakitori Tei" bento box. You get 5 skewers of your choice, miso soup, green salad, cold spaghetti salad, pickled radish, and white rice. The price is less than a 5 skewer yakitori selection on its own. Why? I don't know. It is a bit buried on the menu, so look closely.

Yakitori Taisho was okay...Not terrible, not amazing but just okay. A friend and I went there last night @ around opening time and it became pretty packed, pretty fast. ? The place is a typical East Village hole in the wall....Which is slightly off putting for my fancy suburban tastes. ?Not to mention the seating is small and slightly awkward. ?However I dug the fact that they had coat hangers nearby the seats. For appetizers, we ordered the gyoza to start off with, which took FOREVER to come. ?You know how you start getting hungry to the point where you stare down other folks' food? ?I was *almost* there. ?But finally it came! ?It was crispy, hot, delicious...and a little oily, but that's okay! Entrees - I had the okonomiyaki (a dish I was extremely curious about for a min) and my friend had the fried crab. ?The okonomiyaki was not all that I hoped it to be, but it hit the spot and was filling. ?I really enjoyed the sauce and the mayo atop of the dish, but thought the bonito flakes gave the dish a strange "sterile" flavour. ?I'd try okonomiyaki again, but perhaps somewhere else. ?I am quite fascinated with this strange concoction. Sadly though, my homegirl's fried crab was not nearly as filling, so she ended up ordering the glass noodles. While waiting for the glass noodles, we had sake (my first time). ?It was a pleasant time-killer. Highlight of the night was this group that was seated behind us. ?One of the guys was so drunk that his face was totally red and he was making a scene. ?His poor girlfriend kept on patting him on the head. ?It was entertaining to watch. The noodles finally came after what seemed like an eternity. ?And after my friend consumed her dish, we hit the road. The food was decent...Can't complain. ?But the waiting was what gives this place 3 stars.

This restaurant is a very good Izikaya style place and very close to the types of restaurants that are in Japan. ?Skewer me up! ?The only thing they don't seem to have is the wasabi basted chicken skewers, but their wide variety of skewers is more than enough. We were seated at the bar in front of the grill, this place is crowded and busy and the wait staff was reaching over our heads to get dishes from the chefs. ?This wasn't too bad, but if you're effete, or you're on a first date, you might not like this. ?It's pretty bustling and between the wait staff and the chefs there's a lot to watch. ? The grilled corn looked amazing, but I didn't get a chance to try that...I had the deep fried squid which was really good, plus skewer after skewer of good stuff, including bacon wrapped okra which was excellent. Finished the meal with some matcha brulee (creme brulee with matcha), it was pretty good but not great, next time I'll skip dessert here...(my only ding on this overall great dining experience).

We came here at about 2am after being out at a nearby bar. ?We didn't really know what to expect but had high hopes based on how crowded it was! ?I ordered the kimchi yakiudon which was amazing! ?The next few months I craved this dish constantly! ? We also ordered a combination of yakitoris that were pretty good too. ? This is definitely a great place to go when you're up late - just don't be surprised if you're surrounded by loud drunk people!

Went on a Saturday night with a group of 7. ?It's a small space, so probably not the best for claustrophobics. ?There was a line, so make sure to get your name on the waiting list. ?But, the line moved pretty fast. ?We were seated within 15 mins. The food is simple, which is what makes it so good. ?Just pieces of chicken, squid, vegetables, etc. dipped in their special sauce and grilled. It's a great place to gather around a table and share a few dishes family style.

Wow. How do you say abdominal bloating in Japanese? All four of us came away from a completely underwhelming meal of dried-out chicken, questionable sashimi, German Shepherd beef cubes, watered-down kimchee nabe, saline-enbibed meat balls and other assorted nibbles with differing degrees of ?stomach ailments. While each meal is on its own is reasonably priced, based on what you get (quality and portion) the end deliverable is not worth the Yen. Service is frenetic at best. Kenka several doors down (with cotton candy!) is far superior in every way (quality, portion, authenticity, service and environment) apart from their child-size, torture stools.

I found this place after all these Yelpers gave it a raving 5 star review. Hubsters and I came here after watching Memphis. The yakitori here was super cheap but mediocre compared to Village Yokocho. The gizzards, chicken thighs, chicken skin, and gyutan didn't impress me. We also ordered one of their simmered unagi tofu dishes. Didn't knock my socks off either. I'd stick to going around the corner to Village Yokocho and dropping into Angel's Share. Another place crossed off of my must tries and definitely off of my will return list.

I came here for the first time for dinner with a Pacific Islander who, by the sounds of it, practically lives at this place. We were seated right away at a table so looks like we came at the perfect time. I have no clue what he ordered but the food kept coming and damn, everything just tasted delicious. From what I recall... -the octopus balls was amaze-balls. It just melted in my mouth. -the chicken skin on a stick was yummy in my tummy. -the french fries with spicy cod roe & mayo was out of this world. -the sliced squid was in some heavenly sauce. -the bowl with 3 skewers (2 chicken, 1 beef), kimchi over rice was great, although I could not finish it. I was too full at this point. I left this place with major food baby. Thank goodness I wore a loose dress!

I arrived around 6:30 pm on a weekday night, but had to wait about 15 minutes for hubby to arrive. The place was only half full around that time. They won't seat you on a table until everyone is present, so during those 15 minutes I waited at the bar in front of the kitchen/grill. We ordered a couple skewers and a salad: * Beef tounge: just OK. I am used to more thinly sliced tongue in CA, however the tongues I had at NYC, both Yakitori Totto and here were both thick. I didn't quite like the tongue texture here, Yakitori Totto has better beef toungue * Chicken heart: good, plump and perfectly seasoned, on par with Yakitori Totto's * Chicken skin: meh, extremely oily and not crisp, it's like eating half cooked bacon * Beef meatball: very good, I'd highly recommend this dish * Quail egg: bland and non appetizing, it lacks seasoning on the outside * Chicken with plum sauce: stay away from this! The meat is dry and the plum sauce is very sour * Asparagus wrapped in bacon: good flavor, but I personally think the bacon is too thick and needs a bit more time on the grill to crisp out * Salad with tiny fish: just OK, Yakitori Totto has similar dish and it is much better Conclusion: When it comes to Yakitori, Yakitori Totto's skewers are hands down a better choice TIP: If you want good deal for skewers get theYakitori Tei bento box, it is under the Entree section. You get 5 skewers of your choice, miso soup, salad, spaghetti, potato salad, and rice for $9. Drawback is that each skewers has to be those less than $2 each, otherwise you need to pay the difference, I.e. say you order 4 skewers each less than $2 but the fifth choice is $2.50, you'll end up with $9.50 pricetag.

Fun place, but tiny. We were a big group (around 10), so they put us all the way in the back (past the kitchen and bathrooms; we thought we might actually be murdered on the way there. Anyway, we had no idea what to order since there was so much on the menu, so we asked our server about what was the most popular. He chose a bunch of skewer packages for us (10 assorted ones in each package), some sort of turnip pancake, gyoza and some kimchi noodles. Well, he chose that and we doubled it. It was a great amount of food, and fun to eat family style. The best skewers were the chicken (not the chicken skin) and the beef. I was also a fan of the meatball and scallion (though the latter didn't seem like a good deal). I will say that we also agreed to order some things (like fries and edamame) and they never came. Only other complaint was that the back room eventually got crowded and we were bumping elbows with people behind us. The tables were also small, and we ended up spilling drinks on at least two separate occasions. This was before we got into our beer and sake!

I promise I am not just giving everybody in NYC a 5 star for no reason! This place was great after a night of drinking and winding it down. Well we thought we were gonna wind down but this food got us excited. It was quite charming for a place that looks a bit dangerous. It's like partying with a girl that's bad news and you know you shouldn't be with her but it is just too much fun and you know you will never ever bring her home to mom. This restaurant has that appeal, that I'm dangerous and fun and delicious, of course without it ever really jeopardizing your life in any way! I was surprised to see a passed out woman in the men bathroom which was interesting trying to see if she was OK, she was. Got her some water and her friends took care of her. Anyways the food! I remember having the the combo Yakitori skewers and Miriam had the Kimshi Yakiudon which I stole most of! It Is GOOD! Come here sober, buzzed, or blitzed it's still gonna be delicious!

What can I say about ?this place except that I love japanese street food and this place does it very well. Grab an beer or seven and order some japanese tapas with a group of friends. The place is relaxed, loud and comfortable. There is a wait normally but they are pretty courteous and will try to sit you ASAP. I highly recommend the fried cheese wrapped in fishcake...

There was a line of about 15 people waiting to get in when they opened for dinner on a Saturday. Pretty ridiculous... ...Ridiculously AWESOME! This place scores maximum points on my quality of food-to-price ratio. It's a little overwhelming looking at all of the different kinds of meats you can order, so we actually went with a couple of the sets and got to sample a bunch. The meatball I think was one of our favorites. I wouldn't say it's worth an hour wait, but if you can get here near opening time, I say go for it, definitely.

Such a little crowded place, always full of people! Table was really small! We went there in five, and waited for about 20 mins at about 6:30pm on a Saturday evening. We ordered a lot, including 3 bowls of ramen, saba, fish and meat, two desserts, and some more, for a total of $75 pretax, which was really good. The service was good, and the amount was pretty large. A friend from Japan liked this place. Will go there again. It seems that they accept table reserve. Try yourself!

After traveling across the country to see a baseball game, only to have it rained out, I was super bummed. ?Yakitori taisho helped me cheer up just a bit, even on a cold, damp night. ?I haven't had really good yakitori outside of Japan, so I was curious when we came here, especially with the chaos and ?hole in the wall atmosphere. ?However, it was busy, so that tells you something.

Cold drinks, fresh veggies, and tasty dishes! Yakitori Taisho is the scary non fire-safe dirty authentic heavenly Japanese restaurant! The skewers are amazing, anything fried by them is delicious, even the ramen is good - and Ippudo is near! Service is always under suspicion, and if you're in the "Back garden" it really means a room in the back that doesn't seem "secret" but more scary, like you're the "red-headed stepchild" - like Chunk ala goonies. I always get the Unagi Tofu and French Fries and Sapporo. The one steal, like absolutely criminal steal is the soju/sake flight/tasting. For $12 you can get 3 different soju/sakes and they range from high end to sour mash... If you're feeling extra adventurous get the quail eggs, chicken skin, beef tongue... and if your there at the right time get the Fried ice cream or green tea creme brulee. Even though Yakitori Taisho isn't known for ice cream, creme brulee or ramen, they're down right delicious...

Long favorite casual eatery of mine, especially among the many other mediocre Japanese restaurants around the area. The wait on the weekends can get ridiculous... Come by 7pm on a weeknight and you should be fine. They have a couple of bigger tables for parties of 4-6, or you can just sit at the bar and watch the cooks grill the yakitori skewers as you contemplate what to eat. The yakitori sets are a pretty good deal; $13.50 for 10 sticks, and they offer 3 different varieties. I really like the shrimp, meatball, chicken and shishito peppers. Besides the yakitori, some of my other favorites are basically very simple yet satisfying foods. The kabocha (pumpkin) tempura is out of this world, as well as the grilled squid. For something a little more exciting, try the unagi tofu hodge podge served in a mini skillet, the baked unagi rolls, and tofu and jellyfish salad with korean gojujjang. Add a couple pitchers of Sapporo draft and you're good.

This was such a cute spot! ?It's very casual and down to earth. ?I went here with my boyfriend on a Friday night at around 6:30pm; it was packed, but we were still seated very promptly. ?We got a table in the way back away from much of the bustle which is a big part of this restaurant's charm, but it's okay I guess because the back also smelled less heavily of grilled food haha (we were dressed up and about to go to see Chicago so I didn't mind too much). We started off with the Aspara Mentai (asparagus with spicy cod roe & mayo sauce) which was awesome. We also got a few of the yakitori skewers (beef, beef tongue, chicken gizzard, chicken heart), the Unagi Tofu (hodge podge of eel, tofu, egg in a special sauce), and a pork thing that was served with avocado and a sweet sauce. It was all really good! ?I had never eaten beef tongue before, so I'm glad we tried that skewer. ?I was pretty full after all that food, but the bf proceeded to order several more skewers for himself lol Overall the only bad thing is that we didn't get to sit toward the front of the restaurant where all the action was :)

This is my default. "I have a giant group of people with no reservations on a weekend" place. I've gone here with groups from 2-to-11. Usually the wait is no more than 30 minutes. Yakitori usually makes everyone happy (maybe not vegetarians) and I think Yakitori Taisho does it the best at a reasonable price. The menu is expansive though like more yakotori places. I'm still overwhelmed when I go here. Skewers I've had: Pork: It's pork. Nothing special. Chicken: It's chicken. Nothing special. Chicken Meatball: Good Flavor. Chicken Gizzard: More of a texture thing it guess than flavor. The gizzard is very chewy and in this case dry since they grill it. Chicken Skin: Crispy and full of fatty flavor. Yum! Chicken Heart: YT does a great chicken Heart for the adventurous Squid Legs: A bit chewy, but good. Other things: Ikayaki: Grilled Squid. One of my friends loves this and will always get it when she comes here. Takoyaki: Fried well. Perhaps too much dough Okonomiyaki: The first time I got okonomiyaki, I was like "what is this pancake thing?" It's filled with all types of seafood. Sometimes the sauce can be overwhelming, but its a must-get. Yakisoba: Soba noodles. Nothing special. What you would expect for yakisoba anywhere. Hokke: Eh... not my favorite. But maybe its because I'm picky about my fish. Sweet & Sour Pork Belly: More oil than sweet and sour, the pork belly is cooked until tender at least. Ramen: Never gotten it myself, but it has been approved by my noodle-obsessed friend so I guess it must be pretty good. $6 is a good price as well. Dried Skate wing: Served with Mayo. Pretty good and something new to try. But the last couple of times, I've tried to order, its never come out and I've had to cancel the order because I'm all done. Pitchers of Kirin and Sapporo are cheap ($12) and serve about 5 drinks. A great way to start or end a night. Service: A bit spotty. They take your order. But after that, you'll have to wave down the staff if you want anything. I save this for out-of-town friends when I have to pick a place in a pinch.

My FAVORITE and my MUST-GO-EVERYTIME-I-VISIT-NYC restaurant. ?Yakitori Taisho. ?I came here for the first time about 9 years ago, and ever since then, I ALWAYS eat at Taisho everytime I visit. ?It's been about 1.5 years since I last visited NYC. ?I was pretty excited to come back this time around. ?I always want to order so much when I come here because everything here is so good. ?I limited myself to 3 things. ?I ordered a gyoza (dumplings)http://static.px.yelp.co…, takoyaki (battered octopus balls) http://static.px.yelp.co… and Hakata Ramen (pork base soup ramen)http://static.px.yelp.co…. ?My boyfriend had Taisho for the first time and he loved it. ?I mean who wouldn't? This place is super authentic. ?The okonomiyaki here is awesome, but I didn't order it this time... I totally should have! The wait here can get pretty ridiculous. ?I've waited for an hour and a half before. ?Since we came around 1am this time we got seated right away~! ?The place is a little narrow, so some seats can be uncomfortable, but hey its a Japanese Izakaya (Japanese drinking establishment which also serves food to accompany the drinks. The food is usually more substantial than that offered in other types of drinking establishments in Japan such as bars or snack bars. They are popular, casual and relatively cheap places for after-work drinking. - wikipedia) It's a great setup for it and it puts you in a mood lol. Good price, good food~ I love this place!

What's more confusing than two similarly-named, similarly-attired yakitori places on the same block? Not much. Afraid I can't be too useful here: My friends ordered everything, though I can say that all of the yakitori we had came out fast and were tasty - I guarantee your stomach will leave happy. Just sit out front, people-watch, and order at random, and you can pretend to be me.

Yakitori Taisho is a basement Japanese restaurant in St. Marks. You walk down a few steps, through the shorter-than-normal door, and get lead to any possible open seat, no matter how crammed that space may be, literally, whether is be against the grill they cook on, next to the fryer, or even behind the kitchen in the back room. Some may find this disguisting, but to me, this is intriguing. You don't find many places like Yakitori Taisho, one that, upon arrival, makes you feel as if you're not in the right place, but definitely somewhere you want to be. It gets pretty toasty when you sit next to the grill and fryer, but it is great getting to watch the cooks in action as they are preparing your delicious meal right in front of you. This place definitely has two stand-out items that almost everyone orders; the skewers, and the mentai fries. Another great thing about YT is the value. You can go in here and order 5 skewers for under $10, and get many items for under $20, no problem. The Mentai potatoes were good. I would not order them again, simply because I can get better fries at about a dozen other places within a 3 block radius. They are nice, thickly-cut potatoes, fresh fried right in front of you, served with a Japanese spicy mayo, which was no more special than simply mixing a bit of sriracha and Hellman's. The key items at YT are the skewers. The chicken skewers are nice and soft, white-as-a-cloud pieces of chicken, delicious. The steak is also very good, nicely seasoned and tons of flavor in every tiny bite. STAY AWAY FROM THE GIZZARD, IT TASTES LIKE DOG FOOD. I had to get that off my chest before I forget. The bacon-wrapped-scallop skewers are definitely my favorite. They are grilled, plump little fellas wrapped in deliciously salty bacon. The chicken skin is delicious, one of my favorite skewers they serve. It's surprisingly a bit sweet, seasoned well and is completely unexpected, since mom always told me not to eat the skin of my chicken because it was unhealthy, I had no idea it could be SO damn tasty. Anyway, on to some other dishes. The BBQ Pork w/ Avocado is probably my favorite dish here. Deliciously saucey sliced pork with fresh avocado, cooked to perfection. Also, the spicy tuna appetizer happens to be pretty good. Nice, fresh red tuna with a bit of spicy mayo, paired with some thinly-sliced cucumber. The Breaded Rock Shrimp comes with a delicious mustard cream sauce, which is sweet and is definitely a sauce I have never had, but I loved it. All in all, this place is a ton of fun, filled with delicious food, and has a very wired environment. I highly recommend Yakitori Taisho if you want a delicious, unique meal with that comes along with some scrumtious twists and turns on your pallete.

I told the most rudest waitress, there's going to be three people.. ?at that time, I was the only person... ?so she made me at the bar... OK, acceptable.. ?when one of friends came, we finally got a table... good! ?she brought me small cake for cheering up, they said NO CAKE at their place.. OK, still acceptable... grrrrr... ? waiter, he kept coming w/ wrong dishes... OK... lovely~ ?when another friend came, we'd already started with Hot Sake, Beer, Okonomiyaki, and Yakitori set B w/ some others (don't remember... )... ?he ordered Eel and egg over rice... was OK... ?well, the waiter kept bring w/ wrong dishes... well... thanks, but go away, please~ ? food? ?service?? ?wasn't that good enough... cuz I didn't speak Japanese?? ?however, I will give them another chance, since my both friends liked it... ?well... ?maybe??

3.5 stars As the most reviewed yakitori restaurant in NYC, I had high expectations for the 4-starred Yakitori Taisho. ?I was hoping it would be just as great as my recent experience at Nanbankan in LA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). ?But of course it didn't. Yakitori items are cooked on the grill, so you would think they should be pretty darn hot when they're brought to your table. ?But almost all of my meat-on-a-stick items were cold. ?Just think -- room-temperature grilled bacon over asparagus. ?Yeah, exactly. ?It's not good. We ordered Set B (2 skewers each of chicken, chicken meatballs, shrimp, beef, and scallions), chicken gizzards, bacon-wrapped scallops, bacon-wrapped asparagus, and shitake mushrooms. ?Everything was just okay, it seemed like they don't season the meats very well. ?My favorite item had to be the chicken gizzards, mainly because they were the hottest item to arrive at our table. Yakitori Taisho also has an interesting and nice selection of non-grilled foods too, such as takoyaki, french fries with spicy cod roe dipping sauce, tuna and avocado salad, deep fried fish cake stuffed with cheese (aka Chikuwa Cheese), kimchi stews, and ramen. ?I wish I could have tried them all, but there was only so much the 4 of us could eat. ?The chikuwa cheese is definitely an acquired taste and not really my cup o' tea. ?The tuna in the tuna avocado salad was not the freshest, but they give you a lot of fish and big chunks of it too. ?The ramen was really satisfying, especially since I had just spent $16 on a bowl of ramen from Ippudo earlier in the day, so this $8 bowl was an obvious steal to me. ?But they also use the thin angel hair-like ramen noodles here too. ?What is up with that? Yakitori Taisho definitely makes the cheap eats list, as our bill came out to $70 for about 20 meat and veggies-on-a-stick, tuna and avocado salad, ramen, chikuwa cheese, and two large bottles of Asahi. ?And although their menu is full of appealing and interesting items, the food was only slightly above par.

I've been here several times. I like this place, but it seems like the service is getting worse and worse each time. If their food wasn't that tasty, I would give this place 3 stars. I think the service has gotten worse simply due to its popularity. ?Every time I've been here its progressively gotten more and more crowded so I can't really hold it against them if they're service isn't as quick as it used to be. The menu has a nice diverse selection, however, I normally get the chicken meatballs and grilled salmon onigiri. ?This place is great to kick back with a few friends over drinks.

if you eat here and you like potatoes, you need to order the FRENCH FRIES WITH THE SPICY COD ROE MAYO. ?Do you want to know how good it is? ?It's so good that since Saturday night, I have wanted to go to YAKITORI TAISHO every single day since just so I can lick the spicy cod roe off a delicious right-out-of-the-oven-so-hot-you-will-burn-your-?fingers-but-it-doesn't-matter-it's-so-good FRENCH FRY. ?That is how good it was. Also, if you are a novice at Yakitori, here are a list of recommendations. ?Eggplant and pork dish, okonomiyaki, the sampler skewer, the spicy udon with kimchee and pork, the unagi tofu, and of course the FRIES with spicy cod roe mayo.

From Yakitori to Decibel From Decibel to Yakitori 2 different nights, 2 non related friends. I didn't know the plans and both bring me to the same places.. ?? how could I forget Yakitori after this? Anyways, you don't need this funny coincidence to remember Yaki. About Yakitori I keep an idea on my mind: very relaxing, very casual; a summer BBQ with friends in a backyard but in St Marks and indoor. Is not that the food is amazing as well as the service as well as the ambiance. For me, this is like a place for a spontaneous dinner, late or early night because dinner is not like the most important thing that night, or because you didn't get dinner on time or you are just hungry any time. I like the tables in the back but I clearly love to seat in the bar area, watching the guys making the food. They are busy and so you have to decide what to order quickly. They are nice but they will pressure you; I didn't consider this rude, it match with the place. The Yakitori is good enough and so many to choose; including the animal parts that you never consider to eat; my first Chicken Skin Yakitori, crispy and very tasty. The miso soup is a regular soup, always comforting; the rice balls have a crispy outside as well, softy inside, and are huge. The wasabi octopus was really good and I loved the Hodge Podge Unagi Tofu (eel, tofu, egg in special sauce); semi-sweet flavor and eel that literally melted in your mouth. I'll definitely come back in a context where "I just want to eat something good, cheap and without any preparation" . Next time I don't think I have a 3rd surprise Decibel-Yakitori, Yakitori -Decibel night with another friend... well, you never know, tho.

I came here late at night where it was about to close in 20 min. ?So glad we made it in time! ?I don't remember everything my friends ordered but here were some that I do remember.... Mentai fries with spicy cod mayo: big thick cut fries that are pretty soft with a slight crisp dipped in the spicy cod mayo mmmm. ?The cod in the mayo gives it a Japanese twist. Ika Geso garlic squid: damn this was my favorite! ?The squid was cooked perfectly with that buttery garlic flavor. ?A must order! A bunch of the yakitori from the bacon wrapped garlic (mmmm I loved this one), quail eggs, to all sorts of chicken. ? Salmon sashimi: very fresh and good The rest I don't know the names to but it was all very good. ?6 of us just wiped about 10 dishes or so. ?My faves were the mentai fries and Ika Geso squid. ?I loved this place and would recommend it to everyone.

Stepping into Yakitori Taisho, you would notice that there is a row of counter seats where you sit right in front of the man grilling your meats. The small and crowded establishment has a lot of character. We ordered a variety of chicken parts such as gizzard, heart, and the skin. They were all exceptionally well seasoned. The star of the night was the chicken skin. Burnt just enough to bring out the flavors and brushed with a special sauce, it was out of this world. Unfortunately, dinner was spoilt because we were seated near the back where you could see the workers slicing and skewering the Yakitori meat. They should have built a screen door or put drapes over the back entrance. Otherwise, a decent choice of dinner.

Food - Take your time and keep ordering! I never remember exactly what I order because I constantly order random shit off their menu. Drinks - Stick with pitchers of Japanese beer. Service - Fantastic! Advice - You wanna get here early before they open. Seating is limited and the wait can be LONG!!

I've been here a couple of times and the food never fails to amaze me. It's almost a given that you would have to wait for a table but it'll be worth it. There are other Yakitori places around it where you wouldn't have to wait for a table but nothing comes close to Y.T. My brother from San Diego is in town for a visit so I decided to take him there. We had the Octopus Balls, Chicken Gizzard, chicken and beef bbq. He enjoyed it so much that he finished his bowl just as I was halfway through mine. I wanted to give it 5 stars but our server forgot about our Octopus Balls and served it as we were about to finish our main meal. Anyway, this is one restaurant that I'll be coming back to again and again.

Chicken kebabs in the NY are a dish most frequently served up by your friendly corner street vendor. The chicken is either mostly fat, or so dry, you need a bottle of water to rehydrate it before consuming. The skewer is about the only thing these street kebabs have in common with Yakitori. Over cooked, over marinated and a far cry from the street kebabs I grew up eating at summer Matsuris (festivals), in Japan. Yakitori Taisho is a shining example of what charcoal grilled chicken skewers should be. Moist, tender tidbits of perfectly seasoned meat that are grilled over coals until the sugar in the glaze just starts to caramelize lending an earthy smoky flavor. But it's not just the meat offerings they do well. The grilled negi (scallions) are dusted with sea salt and grilled to sweet perfection and the Yaki Onigiri (grilled rice ball) is grilled crispy on the outside with a caramelized terriyaki glaze. Stir-frys such as the Buta-Kimchee (pork and kimchee) are classic Izakaya fair done well. The sake and shochu list is quite impressive and reasonably priced. Making this the perfect place to pull up a seat at the bar and get a beverage and some tasty snacks after a long day at the office. One thing to be aware of; this place gets crowded and yet there are almost always seats open at the bar in front of the grill. Unless you're from Death Valley, or plan on doing some Bikram Yoga, resist the urge to take these open seats. You'll be sweating faster than you can drink.

I've never been to this place because I assumed that there wouldn't be anything for a vegetarian on the menu. ?It turns out I was wrong. ?Besides miso soup, and a good complement of salads, there were rice balls, and some other stuff that looked good. I had Kaisou Salad, which is a seaweed salad, and it was one of the best I have ever had. ?Really top-notch. ?I also had ume-boshi onigiri - translation, sour plum rice ball. ?It was also five stars. ?It's also open late. If you're a meat-eating fan, you will definitely love this place. ?It's like a little bit of Japan in New York.

1. Come with one other person and sit right in front of the kitchen/grill. ? 2. Ogle each plate as it comes out and silently curse that you didn't order the "insert dish here". 3. Drink cheap Japanese beers on tap. 4. Eat food straight from skewers while they're hot (favorites were the chicken, chicken skin, shitake mushroom, & gizzard). 5. Drink more beer. 6. The check came out to only $60 for two people? ?But we ordered 3 appetizers, 14 skewers, and several beers! ?Never mind. Come here early, sit back and appreciate the incoherent yelling & good food.

Forget Sushi. Sashimi Who? When you are drunk and hungry you want something fried and disgusting. That's when you look for a hotdog stand or a pizzeria. Taisho Yakitori on the other hand has good quality little munchies to big bowls of noodles to big boxes of varieties. Yakitori is basically skewers. Japanese style.They have everything from chicken gizzard to all veg (scallions!) to meats. They also have awesomely huge jugs of frozen blend green apple drinks to different sized bottles of kirin and sapparo. Also a good light hot/cold sake and shochu list. It's more fun to go when you've done a tiny bit of bar hopping. Lots of yapping against the japanese rock is fun. We used to go alot after work too. Cheap!!! ? TOO BAD the young folks of NYC somehow discovered it and made it so that they card here now. Not that it's a big deal but it used to be so foreign casual and easy going without that unnecessary they're watching you feeling. I adore how the studly yakitori cooks greet you from the grill as you walk in or out. Service is attentive in this quite cramped but not over claustrophobic seating place. There's a lot of benches and little 3-4 tops. Not much room for a crowd unless you go to Taisho #1 for the room in the back near the bathrooms. #1 is the original spot Taisho (cutest round owner/man alive!) had. #2 is much cleaner and has a bigger menu option. Even a bit of fresh seafood and such... steamed mussel soup, octopus.. etc. Order the Chikuwa Cheese (that mayo goes with all), Salmon in Seaweed Rolls, Donkatsu Bento Box and everything else! They have pictures.. since I am not able to name them (mostly due to laziness) with it's correct japanese names. You would probably be able to tell right away that Taisho's a popular guy.. from the polaroids all over the walls but it's nice to see him (the animated guy all over the menus) hang out on the stoops of the restaurants. No matter how easy it is to find yourself scurrying there... go in small doses.. it can get lame after too many trips... but only in a row.. you should still go. A L O T.

DEEREECHUS! Hot, tasty, barbequed meat on skewers.... made by goooood-looking Japanese chef-dudes. Like a B-grade dream come true. What's not to like? I especially recommend: Chicken chunks and seared tuna Can get kind of crowded, and seating is relatively limited... so come during the off hours. A little after midnight seemed like a good downtime before the drunken NYU crowd started filing in like hungry freshmen zombies. So good.

It happens every time and I can't help it. Whenever I enter this Japanese joint, the image of a steamy ski resort in the Alps pops up and stubbornly elbows its way through my mental images. Yakitori Taisho is narrow, smoky and crowded. In a good way. It is always very snug in there. The menu is massive. First off, I suggest picking out the B option from the Yakitori list, which boasts chicken, chicken meat balls, scallion, two shrimps and beef. The Ika Yaki grilled squid is a pink jewel: soft, flavory and beautifully presented. Also delicious is the chicken, shrimp, veggies soup named Tomuyankun Nabe. Don't forget to order some plum wine. It is a little expensive, but worth the money. This gritty world will turn into velvet.

It's good to know this place is still as good as I remembered it to be. ? If you're w/a group of friends, I def recommend splitting one of their tonkotsu ramens, yum! For appetizers, I recommend trying the salmon cream yakisoba for the cream, it could go w/o the chunks of salmon.. the duck is good too w/the raw slices of onion. ?The rock shrimp is verrryy tasty!! its def a good appetizer to share w/everyone. ?I don't recommend the edamame, it came out really cold :/ The spicy tuna was really tasty too, def has a kick to it! We ended up ordering one of set yakitori meals, in the long run its just a better value ?Ours had two shrimps, green onion, beef, chicken, chicken meat balls and we ordered a la cart bacon wrapped scallops and bacon wrapped asparagus. ?The chicken and beef are great, the shrimps not bad, I love the grilled green onion. ?The one thing I wouldn't highly recommend is the bacon wrapped scallops.. a little too fishy.. Another great meal here, hopefully i'll get a chance next time to sit in the front (dont like sitting in the back, feels kinda gross back here ) expensive for sure..but thats what to expect when you eat yakitori and try to get full.

I dont know if it's because we were sitting outside but service wasnt that great. We asked for water, the table next to us got it, my date asked for a fork and of course the table next to us got it but we didnt . We didn't get our water till almost the end of our meal .

yum yum! The hotate bacon won me the hell over!!! I really liked this place in terms of the food and the establishment. Yes, it's tight but it's really cozy. These small cozy places are what makes NYC so great and interesting, and when it's accompanied by good food what more could you want. The only thing I didn't like about taisho was that they don't marinade the meat. They grill it first then dip it in the sauce. I don't have a problem with it but I just think it would be better if they marinaded it first so that you could really taste the flavor in the meat. Regardless...I loved this place =) Oh man did I mention how much I loooooveed the hotate bacon! I loooove hotate (scallop) and I loooove bacon!!! I can't wait to go back!!!

This review will come in two pieces. ?First I will tell you about the place and then the food. Atmosphere - Let's just say that cozy is not a word to describe this place. ?I agree with other reviewers that this is a nice hangout place for college kids, but it ends there. ?If you are a big person..then I am sorry to say that you will have a hard time eating here. ?The tables are small and they really try to squeeze everyone together. ?If you are going in the winter or like to wear heavy clothing you are out of luck..since there is no place to put anything away. ?The place opens up at 6...We got there at 6:05 and waited 20 min. for a table of 3. If you have a large party I would prepare myself for a bit of a wait..or get there before 6. ?LOL Food - I will only comment on what I ordered. ?We had the chicken variety yakitori, tuna avocado salad, miso soup with tofu and extra bacon wrapped scallops. ?To drink we had sake and two beers from tap, Kirin and Saporo. ?The chicken Yakitori was good and bad. The meatballs were delicious as well as the chicken itself. ?The chicken skin on the other hand was not crispy enough and therefore tasted a bit chewy. ?Now the gizzards were also not what I expected. ?I eat gizzards a lot and this was just fat on a stick with no taste. ?The salad was very delicious and the soup was also good. The beer from tap, I am sorry to say was very watered down so if you decide on beer order the bottle. Overall, this was an interesting experience..but I think there are better places to be had in that neighborhood. ?If you are looking for some cheap food late at night with a couple of buddies and you know what to order this place is not bad...otherwise the time wasted waiting is not really worth the food.

3.5/5 Always go here with my boys if we decide to eat and drink at St Marks. Cheap to eat and drink. The best beer side dishes are the Yakitoris and Cod Fries. The Yakitoris are cheap (about $1-2 each depending on the type), I usually get the combo with the different parts of chicken, which gives more bang for your buck. The Cod Fries, which basically is freshly cooked fries with cod flavored dipping sauce on the side, is a must. The beer and sake selections are cheap to drink and get the job done for pregaming before a club party, or just get smashed overall. The other dishes are mediocre at best from what I've seen. But, if you need a good sake dive bar around the area. This is a must, although it does get crowded really easily especially during the weekends.

Yelpers, you disappointed me... This place is seriously overrated, just a whole lot of nothing going on. Gotta hand it to the owners though. Take some meat and veggies, cut it up, stick em on skewers, and VOILA! ?There's a line out the door. ?They're geniuses.. The yakitori is awful ?The okonomiyaki was the worst I've tasted in my lifetime. ?It was super thick and doughy, hard on the outside, and just drenched with mayo and a soy glaze. ?After two bites, we asked the server to take it back. ? Seeing the line, we gladly gave up our seats and left as soon as we could. ?If you want a 5* yakitori dining experience, I'd highly suggest a trip to LA and visiting Shin Sen Gumi. Sorry Taisho!

This is pretty much the best place to go for yakitori if you are hungry late at night in St. Marks! Never go on the weekends...unless you are masochistic and like putting yourself through an hour and a half of hunger till your stomach juices burn away your mucosal walls...yeah it's that's bad! Kudos to the Kirin and Sapporo drafts and quick service! It's a small place, so expect to be squished, but think of it as being hugged by Taisho :)

We came here to meet up with one of my gf's friend's birthday dinner. It was crazy busy, we got seated right in front of the restrooms. Anything for good food right? The place was dirty, now don't get me wrong I prefer "hole in the wall" over a five star anyday. But I just didn't get the hype! I have had better at home in Torrance, CA. We ordered the platter, B plate, spicy tuna, seared tuna salad (or something of that sort) and an eel roll. Overall, I'm glad I was able to try this place with great company, but I am not impressed one bit. Will not be going back.

Oh my god. i felt like i was back in Japan! First time here tonight and it MADE my night! My group got here at 5:50 and there were already 2 groups of people waiting to get in. Right at 6 on the dot, they started letting people in, so we didn't have to wait! There was a huge line behind us by 6 tho! The food was authentic Japanese streeet food as everyone else has said. Its cheap, fun, great atmosphere, and just perfect. We have a bunch of different dishes perfect for sharing! Definitely coming back. Im so happy i finally tried this place!

I've been to this place so many times, it never gets old. ?The food is great and the atmosphere is happening or maybe its because I'm so wasted from all the shots and beer I've been drinking there. ?Definitely a place to go with a small group ....no large groups or you'll be stuck waiting outside for hours. ? The seating is tight, but its worth the elbow hitting your eye. ?Watch out for the handdryer...it packs a wallop!

Proprietor/Chef: Ben & Ken Lau This place fucking rocks for izakaya.... you can find various small tapas plates and eat to your heart's content. ?All dishes for the most part can be found for under $10. ?For very little, you can eat like a champ. ?Be creative as there are a ton of variety dishes you can choose from, from yakitori skewers (over 20 kinds), rice balls, sushi, ramen, udon, okonomi-yaki pancake, one of my personal faves, mentai fries with spicy mayo cod roe dip.. it's not really spicy, but it's absolutely delicious. For all locals, tourists, minds alike, this place is a definite MUST in the fun heart of St. Marks. ?All major credit cards accepted and only open for dinner and late nights only. ?It's a tiny hole in the wall, but the food speaks for itself. ?Go ape shit!

Whoa, I have to agree with the others, that is some damn good chicken teriyaki and I haven't ordered that since I discovered that there is more to Japanese food. The food comes out FAST and despite it being kind of a terrifying hole in the wall, the food is GOOD. ?I was a little confused by a tiny pile of spaghetti and the potato salad, but it was not a time to judge. I also got a couple of beef skewers but was a bigger fan of the plain ol' chicken teriyaki. So. Good. And so cheap. I couldn't finish it all, and it was $6.95. That's almost what I pay for a smoothie. That's okay, I'll spend my savings on Jamba. But back to this place... So we all went for the chicken teriyaki except for the brave one who got the grilled squid and said it was the best squid he's ever had. I'm not sure how much grilled squid he's had in his lifetime, but I was too busy enjoying my food to think too much about it. I definitely recommend this place. And it was an amazing day so we enjoyed our food outside. People watching on St Marks is essential. The table was a bit rickety though and the stools (not chairs) are rather uncomfortable so minus a star for that. Otherwise, this place is great.

I took out of town friends & their two pre-teen kids to this place, thinking it had something for everyone, and we were fairly right on. The staff was nice and didn't rush the kids when they were trying to decide what was least weird to their picky palates. The rest of us split takoyaki (comparable to Kenka's), fried oysters, don bowls, quail egg skewers and buta kimchee and a pitcher of Sapporo. The buta kimchee is my new favorite. Thinly sliced, succulent pork and smokey, spicy warm kimchee? It's heaven -- really flavorful, without being greasy or heavy like a lot of bar food. Love! Did I mention we fed a table of 6 people for about $80? No wonder there's always a crowd outside!

I love eating street food so don't get the wrong idea but Yakitori Taisho serious makes me worry about sanitation issues. ?The whole time I was there, I kept thinking that there's no way you would find anything this filthy in a nice place like Japan. We sat at the bar area and I watched the chefs navigate in the tiny cooking space. ?The fryer looked gross and the glass separating the guests from the grill was caked in grease. ?The case where they kept all of the pre-made skewers looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. ?There were little bugs crawling on the table. ?Let's not forget how wet and sticky the menu was. Like I said, I'm ok with street food but Yakitori Taisho wasn't even good. ?We ordered a few skewers - chicken skin, chicken heart, scallop and bacon and beef meatball. ?The chicken skin was not crispy enough for my liking. The chicken heart was dry and flavorless. ?The scallop was overcooked while the bacon was still soft. ? The beef meatballs were decent enough. And yes, we do have chicken skin in LA.

Bad drunk bad drunk / whatcha gonna doo? Whatcha gonna do when it's half past two? Go. To. Taisho. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Get your behind straight to Taisho. Young hip and Asian? Young hip and, um, not Asian? Old, lame and debilitated? Taisho will suit your gastronomic needs just the same. This St. Mark's landmark is where all the cool kids go late night for some super-yummy Japanese tapas. One of many establishments on St. Mark's in the tradition of the Japanese "izakaya," but, in my opinion, the street's crown jewel. On the weekend, expect a long wait. Personally, I like going late on a weeknight. After skipping dinner. Be sure to try the mentai potato (with the tuna roe mayo dipping sauce), chikuwa cheese (deep fried fish cake stuffed with cheese, with mayo dipping sauce), and the tuna tartare (excellent with and without mayo). And the bacon-wrapped asparagus. Oh, and the chicken skin and gizzard and meatball and if I type anymore I'll have to change my pants. Believe me, you shan't be disappointed. If you feel like it, check out their website, it's pretty cool. I love this place so much I made a Facebook page for it; it's THAT good.

Woohoo, I'm the 101st review for Yakitori Taisho! Okay, onto the review now. Oh lord. ?SOOOOOOO TASTY. ?And what a menu! ?I was a little overwhelmed, and I definitely ordered too much food. ?Between two people we had: 10 skewers of deliciousness 1 order of kara age (fried chicken) 1 order of fried squid legs 1 order of french fries with spicy cod roe mayo 1 order of this tasty creamy fried shrimp dish 1 pitcher of kirin It was all amazing, and we had so much food left over on our plate that I seriously think we should have only ordered 5 skewers. ?My favorites skewers were the crispy chicken skin, beef tongue, and pork. ? The fried chicken was pretty good, though it was boneless, which I thought was weird. I ordered the fries, because everyone said too, but I actually think next time I'll forgo the fries, and just order the sauce, and dip other things in it. ?The sauce was pretty awesome. ?I love mayo, I love spicy, and I love cod roe. ?This was dipping sauce nirvana for me. I give Yakitori Taisho 4 stars instead of 5 because the bathroom was pretty gross. ?After the pitcher of beer, my friend and I definitely had to pee. ?When we saw how wet the bathroom floor was, we both rolled up our jeans. ?Yeah, it was that bad. ?However, not so bad that we didn't use the bathroom, and not so bad that we won't be going back. ? Also, the place doesn't open until 6, so for those two people who said it was good for lunch are definitely wrong. ?I know because i was severely disappointed one afternoon around 2.

If you sit at the bar, you run the risk of smelling like fried food. But oh, it's worth it. You never thought they could do so many different things with that grill and fryer. AND HAND-HELD TORCH. Although the menu looks similar to Oh! Taisho, I really liked Yakitori Taisho better. They give you plenty for the price you pay. Eel & egg over rice, kimchi noodles, everything was so worth it. It opens at 6pm like every other place on St. Marks Pl. Yes, it gets busy and crowded. Yes, you might have to wait an hour to get seats. DO IT.

I have absolutely no idea what crazy things the Japanese chefs yell out whenever someone walks through the door, but it always keeps me on my toes. I wanted to yell something back out of curiosity of how they'd react, but I'd rather not get kicked out before devouring some scrumptious skewers from Yakitori Taisho. Walking in to a full crowd on a random weeknight, we wasted no time in grabbing a seat at the bar in front of the chefs & burners. Warning - don't sit at the bar unless you're ready to reek of smoke afterward. Started off with a tuna avocado salad. Expecting a puny plate of mixed greens with a few dices of fish, I surely felt a slap on the face when the waitress set our dish down. There were cubes...CUBES...of freshly cut tuna and massive chunks of avocado drizzled with a light, creamy wasabi dressing. Super refreshing on a hot summer day. Large enough to share between 2 people (only if you're willing to after the first bite). The 6 skewers that followed failed to impress, mainly because 2 of them were served lukewarm (chicken & beef). How do you screw up on something so simple? I wasn't pleased having to ask the chef to heat it up, but glad they did so without hesitation. My favorites of the bunch were the beef tongue (gyutan) & the chicken w/ spicy cod roe (sasami mentai). Great flavor and texture in the meat, but I couldn't shake the bothersome feeling about being served cold food. At this point, our meal was only mediocre...up until the salmon cream yakisoba. This dish alone probably redeemed this entire dinner. Hunks of tender melt-in-your-mouth salmon blanketed the soft cooked soba noodles while garlicy aromas from the sauce filled the air. So simply crafted, and so quickly annihilated by the touch of a fork. Why did this have to end??? Take me back to my happy place.

Every time I visit New York, I always come here. To me, it's a place where I feel right at home. The best thing for me is the Salmon Carpaccio. Once....I ordered 4 plates of it for myself. And i finished it all. Love the Sabashio, the grilled squid, the duck, the steak, the salmon cream yakisoba......and I've yet to try many more things from them. I l-o-v-e this place. No words can describe the joy when I come into this narrow, cramped, crowded placed. One of the best meals I've had in my 19 years of life.......hope to come here till I can't get enough of it anymore. Little tip: don't get carried away with ordering. Don't order more than ?5 plates at a time because they will not stop serving even though your table is full. You will feel the need to rush and scarf all the foods down in a hurry. You don't want to do that.....you're gonna throw up and feel sick later. As long as you order a good amount to fit the plates on your table....who says you can't have a second round....or third?

Where else can you go to get cheap skewers in the middle of the night? Chicken meatballs is so good! Please order a dozen of this! They have a lot of small appetizers for you to choose from so you dont have a problem deciding what to get and if your still not full? just order more chicken meatballs haha My con to this place is that: as a women, it is hard to find a place to put your handbag esp when there is no back to the chair and all the hook on the wall are always taken. This place gets really packeddd since it is so small here.

A friend introduced me to this place years ago and I keep passing it on again and again. ?Hands down, this is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC and good value for your hard earned dollar. Expect cramped, packed seating reminiscent of Tokyo restaurants, but you have enough space for you to sit and eat, no more, no less. ?I've found the pro-active service approach also works best, unless of course if you can speak Japanese like the entire staff. The food menu is rather diverse, equaled only be the sake menu, but this is not a traditional sushi/sashimi spot as they don't serve it here. ?Believe it or not, not all Japanese restaurants offer sushi, but then you may have to go to Japan to discover that for yourself. ?I brought my Japanese father here and after a shared bottle of Otokoyama his verdict was that it was very good and we need to bring my Japanese speaking grandparents. My favorites here: tako wasabi appetizer, tuna avocado salad, and for yakitori: meatball, shrimp, chicken hearts. ?That's not a short list of what's good here, just my best recommendations thus far. In short, this is a must try for culinary exploits in NYC because it's one of those places that everyone either knows or needs to try. ?This place also reminds me of being in Japan, except Americans are much noisier than the Japanese.

Really good food. Went with a group of ?6 and got one of the bigger tables. Really gotta get their early; we were at the table right next to the door and we can see people waiting for like 1 - 2 hours for a seat. The Yakitoris were amazing. We pretty much just order everything on the menu. The only thing I dislike was the Okonomiyaki (I ate a the Korean version and I like that better). My friends wanted to get that because it appears in a lot of anime. The chicken skin and mushroom yakitori was my favorite. My friend just kept ordering sake. The sweet/cold sake there was amazing.

Oh my God this food is great! ?I just discovered yakitori in what seems to be the Japanese restaurant area that is St. Marks Place. I like how the cooks all wear towels on their heads. ?I hope the towels are soaked in cold water, because it looks mighty hot in the kitchen. I love the chicken gizzards and scallops wrapped in bacon! Also, the squid and kim chee with onions was a great combo. The salad with fried fish. ?The fish were so small, they were like tadpoles--all you could recognize were the eyes. ?Sorry to gross you out, but it was delicious.

I love this place, and always make sure I stop by here whenever I'm in town. There is no decor whatsoever. If you're looking for a romantic date, this is the wrong place. Taisho does have excellent Japanese yakitori, which is somewhat like Tapas. There are also many other dishes that are excellent, so be adventurous and try a few things on the menu. Beer is very fresh, so I always order a few pitchers with friends. Expect a long wait but you won't have to pay much for great food.

Gomen nasai. Way back in the early 90s, when I was a student and on a student's budget, there were only two choices for Yakitori/Izakaya-style food available: this one or around the corner on top of Round The Clock (where each skewer cost 3x more), so the choice was clear and I regularly ate here. However, the quality of food has consistently slipped over the years and finally plummeted beyond repair. Prices remain cheap today, but I don't like ingesting carbon, thus I've moved on to Tori Shin uptown instead. Sayonaraaa!

About their food, the skewers were great. ?Grilled just right and were great with vodka or sake drinks. ?Ramen and rice balls were a bit disappointing. ?The rice balls were overdone, totally burnt black on both sides, and this was consistent with others' orders as well. ?The ramen was below average with the salty soup base and dry meat. ?Stick to Yakitori when you're here.

When I walk down the steps into Yakitori Taisho i feel like I'm back in Japan. Feels like a real yakitori place- cramped, sweaty, alchohol infused, loud, and yummy. Stick with yakitori dishes and or the okonomiaki- and lots of beer or sake. Lots. The only downside (and its worth the pain-in -the-ass) is the hipster kids wanting to get all "anime"/ goth - whatever they call themselves.

I ate here each of my last trips to NY back in '06. Based on most of the recent reviews I skimmed, sounds like not much has changed. I don't know if we just ordered the right things or what, but it was the best yakitori I had ever had up until that point. Inside it's small, cramped, and hot...just as it should be! Even to this day, I've tried yakitori at several places during my travels in the NW, Cali, and Vancouver B.C., but each time I leave disappointed. Nothing has come close to this place. It will be on the itinerary or the next eventual visit to NY, no doubt.

The Takoyaki is the best I have had so far in the city. ?The whole grilled squid was tender and delicious...did I mention it was actually tender? The spicy tuna ball is super rich and burned my lips, yum. ?The grilled rice balls were very bland compared to most places and the okonomiyaki was only decent.

I came here with a friend on a cold weeknight after work and it was bustling with business. We didn't feel like waiting for a table so we sat at the bar, which is a bit cramped if you're not used to tiny stools and having little elbow room to eat. We got the creamy salmon soba and chikuwa, which were on the specials menu, along with a bunch of other mishmash of stuff. Everything was pretty good.. including the grilled onigiri which are huuuge. (I like the non grilled onigiri better though.) Can't say how the yakitori is since I've never gotten at this taisho. It was a satisfying meal; our bill came out to $20ish per person. I like this Taisho better than the Oh! Taisho a couple doors down though. If you can get a table it's be a fun place to go with a big group too!

Fun place to eat, but I think the reviews are skewed upwards because people were drunk when eating here. honestly, it was okay. Some things were good, but more things were mediocre. I was so excited about the cow tongue because i love it over the grill at korean places, but it wasn't sliced thin enough making it rather chewy. Marination could also use a little help as I felt everything was marinated in this weird bbq sauce. Of the skewers, I liked the chicken meatballs and gizzard most. Pork looked like all fat at first, but once someone ventured into biting it, we found that it was mostly fat, but did have some meat. Good enough for me. :) We also all ordered an entree each and this was the big mixed bag. It was my first time ordering okonomiyaki -- I was SO excited to try it. Pancake + egg + seafood? I'm there! But it was large, mushy, potatoey (where was the eggyness?) and all topped by this dark, chocolate looking sauce that turned out to be A1+bbq sauce. BLAH. I couldn't even eat most of it... it just didn't taste good, texturally or otherwise. The two dishes of mention both had unagi and both had egg. Coincidence? I think not. UNAGI+EGG = AWESOME. I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend's unatamadon until he finally banned me from stealing any more unagi. -___-;;; The other dish was unagi, egg, and tofu in a broth... looked a lot healthier than most other dishes to be honest. Kinda reminded me of a sukiyaki with just the good stuff. I also liked the grilled onigiri -- tastes just like the rice that gets stuck to the bottom of the pot. love that stuff. :) They're also massive... so it's probably better to share than try to handle one yourself. The key at Yakitori Taisho is variety, and that they have plenty of. The bill for 6 of us came out to $16 a person after tip and tax... which is ridiculous since we all ordered an entree each... Set A skewers + 4 additional ones... and a couple onigiri for the table. Pinkberry and Chikalicious are also right in the area, so save some room for dessert!!

I don't really remember 'cause the booze I had was already beginning to melt my brain a little, but I just remember the chicken skewers being HEAVEN on my beer-slathered tongue (graphic enough for you?). ?I'm not a big fries fan, but the spicy cod roe mayo totally made me binge-eat our helping of fries. ?Just a nice, warm izakaya place. ?I'm determined to come back when I'm of a slightly more stable mind so I can be a bit more discriminating in my tastes... 'cause let's face it, everything tastes amazing (and also tastes like nothing) when you're drunk. ... I can't believe we didn't have okonomiyaki though. ?The hell?

Plus: Get your trans fat fix here just as the city is banning it. Skip the raw stuff and go for the cooked items! Don't be afraid to request the chicken skin skewers to be "well done and extra crispy". The downside: Poor ventilation=bad after odor. Put your name down, get a tattoo across the street; come back in time for them to call your name..yes the waits are long on a weekend. I hope the trans fat police doesn't bust this place.

We had a group of six and had to wait an hour to be sat. ?This place is small. ?When we finally sat down, we were at a table that was half outside the restaurant! Regardless of the size tho-- I'm a total sucker for Japanese food, so I thoroughly enjoyed all the yakitori my small tummy could handle. We had chicken skin, bacon w/ ocra, beef, pork-- basically anything that came on a stick that we thought we'd like.. and it was all delcious (can't forget to mention the rice balls!). Aside from it being summer and me sitting on a table halfway outside-- all the cooking still made me sweaty, but I still ate a lot. Food on a stick = best invention in the world! If you like this place, you'll like it's sister restaurant Oh! Taisho too.

Well being a hardcore Korean BBQ fan the taste of this place was just OK for me. ?First of all upon entering the place was a little tight but cozy. ?This is what NYC is all about. ?High quality places crammed into a tight and fire hazard place. ?Human Yakitori anyone?? ? Well lets begin with the dishes. ?I ordered the chicken, shrimp, scallion, combo with a side order of bacon scallop and pork. ?The quality of all of these were top notch but eating scallions instead of meat was kinda weired. ?It was ok though. ? The taste was a little bland for me especially compared to Korean style BBQ. ?They dip each peace of meat into the sauce once before grilling it and once again after its done grilling. ?More flavor would be accomplished if it was actually marinated a few hours. My favorite of the 5 Yakitori was the bacon scallop Yakitori. ?The salt and fat of the bacon really brings out the flavor of the scallop. ?I would give that Yakitori a 4 star. ?Overall the price is decent and the place is cozy but the food was just OK. ?Not bad not great either. ?*** stars

The way my friends speak of this place, I imagined a line/crowds as large as the ones on Black Friday just to grab a table, I imagined shanking people with a brown broken beer bottle like The Socials and The Greasers, I also imagined being over looked and placed in the back because we're an eye sore. Nope. Not at all. We sat very quickly and went to town. Everything is very simple, very forward, and chewy, and I felt the flavors were so faint that it almost didn't register. What was masticated: Kawa: Chicken Skin (Get this guy!!!) Kimo: Chicken Liver Sunazuri: Chicken Gizzard Ozura: Quail Egg OB Soju

I love this place. There are two of them, divided by a thai restaurant and some other little place, but I always go to the 2nd spot. A very very cute chef works there on Saturday night. His name is Tomo. Show him some love when you go there. :) The food is great. I'd have to say my favorite thing on the menu is the buta kimchi. Oh yeah, and the Tonkotsu ramen!!! Soooooooo good. This is a great place to bring a group of people, drink and stuff your face. Or a great place after you've drank too much, to just sit and stuff your face. ha!

Oh my goodness! This place sure is crammed!!! There's hardly anywhere to walk let alone sit and eat!!! the 8 of us magically fit in this hidden room at the back of the restaurant, past the kitchen and past the bathrooms. I bet initially, that room was not meant for serving customers but they got so popular they had to clear up a store room to fit their growing fan base! This is the first yakitori place I've been to in the city and i've gotta say its got a really fun atmosphere! By no means is it romantic - but it gives this fast-paced, food centered, no frills ?thrills, not unlike the road side stalls/hawkers that are found everywhere on the streets of most Asian countries. This is a place you come solely for the food. You don't come here to have a good conversation (I'm not saying you can't) but you really don't want to because the you want to stuff as much as those delicious yakitori into your mouth as fast as possible. Its a food race in here. Its noisy, its crammed and service is speedy - it all makes me want to eat FAST! Food's here - now ATTACK!!!! I liked most of the stuff we ordered except the Yaki Sake Onigiri (Grilled Rice Ball with Salmon). Too much rice too little salmon and the rice wasn't even flavorful. The (Hokke Tei) Grilled Hokke Fish was quite weird - i couldn't say i liked it. the fish was quite soft a little mushy and it was creamy and sweet too (I couldn't quite make out what taste it was). Too radical for me even though I'm fairly adventurous with food. Yasai Itame (sauteed vegetables) were good too - its sauteed in a special sauce, very fragrant. The yakitoris were all very well done! skewered grilled meats are so much fun to eat!

Yakitori Taisho popped my izakaya cherry. My friend Sean who used to live in Tokyo took me here back when I was all "What? Octopus Balls? How do they even FIND those on an octopus?!" I never sit at the bar in front of the grill - looks far too steamy. If you're lucky, they'll walk you to the back, through their storage area, and into another secret little eating area, mafia style! Their pork yakitori is the most delicious one they have, in my opinion, and I've tried many of them. Their yakisoba is the BEST I have had in NYC or anywhere else, and I've ordered it at quite a few establishments. The takoyaki is top notch too! Polish it off with a tall, cool Sapporo (or 5, whatever) and you are in heaven. Greasy, grilled heaven.

I'll describe the spatial dynamics potential patrons can expect upon entering Yakitori Taisho so my useful votes can catch up with my funny votes - don't want to be the unofficial Yelp clown. So here it goes. Are you ready? This place is fuckin' small. Unless you want to sit at the bar, the tables in the back are scarce, to say the least - there's maybe five or six of 'em by my estimation, and they fill up quickly with East Village stragglers looking to boost their glucose levels back up again. I sat on a stool so small and so low I felt like a grown-up reenacting a diaper commercial for Pampers. Not that great. Okay, so down to the nitty gritty: Candied Sweet Potato Fries - violently sweet (yeah - no shit, but I'm used to them carrying a tinge of saltiness) and dry, with copious amount of cinnamon sprinkled on top. Not what I expected and not what I wanted paired with the steak. Strike one. Steak Special Of The Week - Conversely, this lulled me to sleep with the dire, weak seasoning consisting of a few scallions chopped on top of the meat - which by the way lacked sizzle, spice, and any conceivable sign of life. Strike two. Pork Gyoza - Got this one right - tender and appropriately juicy. Extra points for mellow soy sauce. Ball one. Octopus Dumplings - too much flour, too chewy, too sweet, and not enough octopus. Served with a sad side of mayo that didn't compel. Strike three. Next batter.

Its the original and the better of its sister right next door. that is my opinion although some of my fiends like the other better (Oh! Taisho). The food is the same in both, but the ambiance is much better here. Although small and sometime cramped, and you should come here right at open (5pm). If not be prepared to wait. Obviously the Yakitori is great, the chicken and the beef. Also the boxes aren't a great deal. The kimchee is also great!! The shrimp balls are awesome!!! I haven't had anything here that I haven't loved. Oh did I mention the jumbo size alcoholic drinks!! Sitting at the bar is more fun, but if you want to talk I suggest a table.

As a lover of Japanese food we wanted to like it. We really did but we didn't. The atmosphere is what they are trying to sell. Once you are disappointed in that there is no saving grace. The portions were small. They even gave us scallion skewers in a set course. Scallions are usually free. Katsu was over cooked and it was gristle. Potato salad was cold mashed potatoes. The noodles they gave us were tasteless. The Yakitori came on a bed of cabbage, it was awful. The room was in the back of no where. The emergency door was locked with a table in front of it. The beer was room temperature. It was small and cramped it was like a cave. We were hoping for a low end Sakagura type of experience but not even close. I do not see any reason to go back.

For refreshments, I love the fact you can supersize your drink and get your soda in this huge mug that you can drink till your bladder cries mercy. ?Beer is good and refreshing, melding well with the dishes. ?Or you can get their ice/slushies laced w/vodka. ?Awesome! I advise to go early or prepare for a wait. ?Or you can hop over to Oh! Taisho.

In terms of atmosphere, Yakitori Taisho is the coolest place to hang out and have Japaness Yakitori, a style of Japanese cooking that consists primarily of cooked Japanese dishes on skewers. ?Sort of like Japanese shish kebob. St Mark's Place is a cool part Manhattan near NYU around 8th or 9th Avenue and Broadway. If you've ever seen the movie "The Crow" and recall the scene where the cop was eating lunch in some dark dingy little tavern of sorts, that's the atmosphere you'll feel as you sit down in your tiny seating area. The service is very modern college Japanese. ?You will feel as if you've been placed in a college neighborhood somewhere in Tokyo. ?The servers even speak horrible English. ?That's what actually makes the place cool. I have to admit I was intrigued by the selection of Yakitori dishes. ?There was chicken skin, shrimp, chicken, chicken giblets and others. But all in all, I have to say, although it was nicely prepared and the service was spot on, I really didn't like Yakitori all that much, but because I had fun and enjoyed the atmosphere, 4 stars anyway. ?The prices here are also very reasonable: maybe $25/person after tip and with booze. ?It's definitely worth the experience to check out this part of New York, but after once, I imagine if you're like me, ?you'll be "yakitoried out" and will prefer to go back to the basics of Japanese cooking: sushi, sashimi, and robota.

I decide to write a more detail review of this place.. because they deserve it. I discovered Taisho about 5 years ago and it's been one of my favorite place in the city. I pretty much take everyone there. I love their food simply because it taste AMAZING!!! let me repeat AMAZING.. I like how the place makes you feel you are in another completely different world. Most importantly you DO NOT end up with a huge bill.. price is very reasonable.. they have good selection of drinks too!!! Just make sure don't go there on weekends during 7-10pm it's SUPER CROWDED.. one more thing.. they do have another place 3 doors down.. serve exact same thing.. you can try that place if here is too crowded.. but usually the wait is about the same.

I've been going here since I was a college kid (back in 1999). ?Since I was broke back then, my friends and I would eat yakitori and drink beer / Calpis-hai's here. If you can get a table in the back, it's more fun. The ramen is better than you would expect here. But the main reason to go here is not for the food, it's for the izakaya-like atmosphere and to grab some beers while enjoying the company of friends. When we first started going, it was all Japanese, then Asian American, but now it's a very mixed crowd. ?Glad to see that Yakitori Taisho is still around, including the General himself. ?Now that I'm not as broke, I stay clear away from here.

Really no point in reviewing this since everyone knows about it, but I thought I'd post an additional rave! I come here at least twice a month and I'm always sad when the summer is over because then they stop having the corn on the cob special. I usually eat tofu soup, edamame, potato salad, corn on the cob, grilled rice ball, and mentai potato with mayo on the side (instead of the cod roe sauce). Everyone has their faves! My BF gets the buta mayo, okinomiyaki, steamed rice ball with bonito, and the chicken meatballs. YUM. They always play old hip hop jams. yay! Yum and yay!

Tadaima! Since all of u have already pointed out the many greats and higlights of Yakitori Taisho, I'll just limit myself to my personal favorites/observations: 1. A REAL Japanese McCoy; makes me reminisce 'bout Hirakata-chi. 2. Waiting time is tricky (20-25min), think of it like a tribute ur making to the Shinto gods before the feast. 3. From the skewers: My God, would someone explain in gastronomic terms why is it that the Chicken w/plum sauce is such a exquisite delight of the palate? 4. Wasabi Octopus? Spicy Tuna Tartar? Excellent Takoyaki? Anyone salivating? Also, they have added new dishes to the menu since January. 5. Sake selections, far out. 6. Speedy service, merry environment, perfect lighting, excellent value, generous portions (one thing I'll refrain from saying about Yakitori Yokocho) Of course Five stars; Taisho Mata ne

Got stuck with the table for 3 against the right wall, right before you walk into the creepy hallway to get to the back seating. Great. Every time someone passes behind me, I feel them rub up against my back and upper buttox. Doesn't bode well that we're in the E. Village. Great. I look over to my left and I see this man in the corner, carefully cutting something. He's using a cutting board over a bucket. It looked like a machete and I immediately started thinking of Saw. Great. We ordered our food, 2 carafes of house sake, the taka wasa (sp?) - raw octopus cut up into a small bowl with a wasabi marinade. Picked up the grilled squid, the grilled mackerel, the "japanese pancake" and fresh tofu? (I forget exactly what it was called but basically, cold, bland tofu, with the bonito (sp?) flakes on top - be sure to ask for some soy sauce and douse a little, it makes a big difference. Great. Apparently, my friend has this philosophy that whenever he goes to Taisho, no matter how many people he's with or what he orders, he always manages to spend $20 or less. NO MATTER WHAT. This time, it was me, him and my roommate. Including tip, $21 pp. Great.

So the (former) resident NYC rocker who lived there for 7 years decides to take me on a trip, to show me "his" version of New York. Though I've been to NY a dozen or so times, my visits mostly consist of things like Nobu, Pastis, Buddakan, Craft, etc. ? It was about time I got to do New York, "Bourdain Style"...eatin' authentic, down-home and on the cheap! Our first stop with two friends was Yakitori Taisho. ?I'd been hearing the raves from the boy, for literally months about this place. ? On first glance I was for some reason amazed at how small the place was (I think cozy is probably the preferred term, but I call it claustrophobic). ?Tight quarters, so very NYC. Secondly, and also to my amazement, EVERYONE working there was actually Japanese!!! ? Hallelujah. ? Amen. ? Wellll Welllllllll !!!!!! FINALLY. ? The rad waiter, sporting a healthy head of dreads, took our endless order (chicken skin x10, assorted veggies, rice balls, fried noodles, gyoza...the list goes on). ?After dropping off our mega-huge bottle of Sapporo and some sake we were well on our way to being some seriously happy diners. The food was killer. ?The chicken skin was SICK. ?The concept is clearly kinda gross (grilled chicken skin? ?not quite the healthiest thing in the world), but the flavor was incredible. ?I ate enough for two. ? Everything tasted super yummy and the service was quick. ?I'm a BIG fan. A great place to come with a few friends so you can sample all their yummy eats. ?I'll definitely be going back here next time I'm in town.

Yakitori Taisho is my favorite of the St. Marks Taisho places. If you are wondering what this place consists of, it is pretty much many types of food (mainly meats on a skewer), they also have rice dishes as well. If you aren't that adventurous get the chicken meatball, beef, and chicken chunk. If you are...just take a look at the menu - quail eggs. Oh, and I'm not adventurous. If you sit near the grill, do order a large drink. They don't mess around with the sizes. The waitresses seem like the struggle with the large mugs. This place does get crowded, but luckily there is many things to go do on St. Marks Place. See what the wait is, and if it is 30 minutes, just walk around. Once, they took my friends number, and called when a table was ready. I love this place for drinking sake as well. Great times. I always have a great time here.

This restaurant is entirely one long skinny hallway. If you're seriously claustrophobic, you might want to steer away from this place and maybe try the yakitori spot next door since I've heard they have the same owners. Being that the food is on the scrumdiddlyumptious scale and the place is so tiny, expect to wait a good minute for a table, especially if you have quite a party [the wait is worth it in my opinion]. The sight of our food put stars in my eyes and quickly turned into hearts after the first bite--from the yakitori to the udon soups and appetizers--so good! I just have one mild critique against the bacon wrapped scallops, which were tasty yes, but I just wish my bacon were more crunchy because mine was a bit chewy and soggy looking. It was sad bacon, and the words 'sad' and 'bacon' should never be said in the same sentence. The only stuff I didn't try was the sushi/ sashimi--so duh, of course I'm coming back. And the bonus is [drum roll, please] they've got booze! So order up on some sake or the yogurt flavored cocktail. Yes, I said that right; Yogurt. Flavored. Cocktail. Oh, me love you long time! It tastes like an alcoholic calpico--best thing EVAR. I wouldn't suggest large groups coming here, and by large I mean 10+ people as there just really isn't any room unless you guys don't mind sitting in separate spaces. I don't think they even have a table that sits that big of a party. However, I would definitely go on a date here. Even though it can get loud, the setting is pretty intimate and cozy and the lighting is dimmed just right... bow chika wowowww.

Every time we go here late at night, it's totally full with lines out the door, over the steps and on to the St. Marks St. ?So one day, we decided to hit this joint early and arrived around 5:45. ?Still closed, we decided to walk around the block and window shop. ?By the time we came back around 6:15pm, it was full! ?WTF? ?They said sorry, and took our cell phone number and promised to call, which I thought was cool. We love this joint. ?Totally street foods, which I love and the atmosphere is ?so fun. Plum wine is yummy and their kimchi udon is excellent. ?And of course you can't leave out their famous yakitori of chicken everything including chicken heart/gizzards, and my personal favorite chicken skin...Yum! ?Their rice ball takes a long time to get to you, probably because everyone is ordering it. ?So even if you plan on being their for a while, I would order this first...and still the waitress will warn you that it will take a long time before you get your toasty yummy rice ball. I'm now transplanted to California, and I really miss this place. ?I do however feel that I am slowly out growing this joint. ?This is after all a hangout for the NYU crowds, the isles are way too small for our baby stroller. :) But for you kids and kids at heart, this is the place to hangout! ?

We were in NY for a couple days, and I was eager to try this place due to the Yelp reviews. We went in, and I didnt realize how large this place was! We sat at the bar, ordered some skewers and such, and man, it was probably the best meal we had during our trip. ?It's open until 3am, and it is fresh. My Favorites: 1. Tsukune (chicken meat ball) - flavorful, large, and oh, so tender. My bf's fav. 2. Aspara-Bacon (asparagus wrapped in bacon) - this is my all time favorite. Being a huge bacon fan, the asparagus definately added a flavor like no other! 3. Mori-Q (cucumber with miso paste) - it's simple, I know. But i grew up in Japan eating this in the morning, while my grandma cooked our breakfast.

I got a terrible reaction to what I think was msg last time I ate here, BUT, I still adore this joint and will be back. (Seared tuna!) All the authentic and delicious grilled snacks and outrageously cheap pitchers of Sapporo are well worth it. ?(Try the seared tuna.) Great place to bring friends and out-of-towners. Never fails to impress. Yes, they are busy, but usually if I ask the hostess she will take my number so we can wait it out at the bar across the street. (Order the Tuna!)

What more can you say about a spot that people already know about? I guess I'll give it to you my way! Come early or come late avoid the dinner rushes! If you have been reading my reviews you will already know that this place would most likely be another one of my good eating spots after a night of drinking. I usually come here on a weeknight and either really early or really late on the weekend. Must Have's: 1.Start off by ordering a large Asahi and a large hot sake. 2. Order your Yakitori's! whatever floats your boat but these are my favorites: Chicken, Chicken Skin, Squid Legs, Smelt, Bacon wrapped Enoki and Green Peppers. 3. Mentai Potatoes 4. Grilled Rice Ball 5. Kimchi Stirfried Udon 6. Ramen if you still have the room. So don't be shy and order up! Although the prices seem pretty cheap, just like tapas they sure add up but it's worth the $. =P

It was after 1am and we were hungry. Puny, overpriced hot dogs from the Long Island hockey game DID NOT satisfy our tummies. The boy suggested something Japanese and I turned to trusty Yelp to help us figure out what's open after 1am in East Village. It turns out Yakitori Taisho's last call is 3:30am! AWesome! So we go & get seated immediately and order a B set of yakitori - consisting of tsukune (chicken meat balls), gizzards, chicken meat, scallions & prawns. Jordan wanted to try the garlic ?& quail's egg skewers and also ordered the mentaiko (spicy! but so good) We also ordered the chikuwa cheese and 2 bottles of Ashahi (a must when eating yakitori!) **Note: eat the skewers immediately once they're set on your table - they get cold fast. This place looks, feels, smells and tastes authentic. I love yakitori, I especially love yakitori for supper and boy, was last night's supper yummy! I'm definitely coming back to try the onigiri and more skewers!

I came here with a large group so they brought us through the restaurant into the back which housed more tables. We had 12 people and were a bit cramped. Service was slow and they didn't even fill our waters. Gratuity is normally 18% for large groups but Yakitori Taisho decided to tack on 20% instead. If I had not pointed out this to my group, we would have ended up tipping them almost 40% for $175. Some of the food was good. I recommend the unagi roll and the chicken skin skewer. Beware the chicken skin skewer though, those chickens must have been FAT cause the layer of fat was ridiculous. At $1.50 to $2.50 per skewer isn't all that bad. Their menu is very broad so there is plenty of choices for everyone. Tip: If you have a large group, try to get there before 6:45 to avoid a wait.

Probably one of the better yakitori places in this area of Manhattan, but not the best yakitori by far (Totto uptown is better) and honestly, still haven't found a place that compared to the yakitori I had in Japan. ?Its perpetually packed so go early or wait. ?Down a few steps from the street, the interior is dark wood-paneled, low-ceilinged, with small tables wedged throughout in a cramped, oddly cool way. ?Tables start up front, followed by booth sitting at the yakitori grilling area, the largest area after that then a corridor opening into a back area with more tables. It gets smoky by the yakitori grilling area, so be warned, although it can be fun to be there watching them prepare the food. ?Menu is extensive, more izakaya than purely yakitori, and I've had many of these items in other places and Japan. Last time I went (about a month ago), I shared multiple items, including a selection of yakitori, chicken (liver, skin, wing, chicken with spicy cod roe) and others (bacon with scallop). ?These were ok, but again, nothing special. ?Had a grilled mackeral (decent, still average), unagi tofu (ok), and unatama don (ok, although eel was a touch fishy). ?Had more but can't remember what. ?No matter what, yakitori tastes best with beer, so had a big jug of Yebisu ^_^ Overall, I can understand the lines b/c this place is fun to eat at, with a funky and cool atmosphere, tons of menu choices, and a young, hip Japanese staff. ?But I find the quality of the food to be average, with only occasional highlights. ?Granted, if your exposure to this type of food is limited, your rating may be better. ?I would return, knowing not to expect more than what I've gotten.

I go to this place every time i can convince my friends that the food here is safe. It's one of my most favorite restaurants in all of New York and beyond. If you think you know japanese food, you haven't had japanese food until you've been here. Beware of the lines though. The wait is shorter if you opt to sit at the bar, which I actual prefer; it's fun to watch the chef on the other side!

I really wanted to like this place and give it higher ratings (just like Thinh N...haha) but I couldn't. maybe I didn't try the right things. Maybe the chefs were just in a rush. Whatever the reason, the food didn't jive with me that well. The salmon avocado salad was good, really refreshing. The negi ramen was good, not mindblowing, but decent. Good texture of noodles, though they are skinny noodles not the thicker ones I like. We got the okonomiyake, which was too thick with flour for my taste; I would have preferred more veggies, less flour. We also got some eel sushi but the rice was really hard, not the soft sushi rice I usually expect. I think next time I will exclusively order off the yakitori menu, because everything else was just ok...

After seeing all of these reviews on here and seeing that it was the most bookmarked location in NYC on Yelp I couldn't help myself and tried it tonight. ? Even before the place is open the line goes up the steps and down the street, a line long enough to fill the place up the instant it opens. ?Luckily we were first in line, but we did need to stand around for about a half hour in order to secure that position. The food was wonderful and the atmosphere took me out of New York for the little while that we were in there, with a large 22oz beer at my site I felt taken away from it all as I chomped down on my chicken meat balls and fried pork. ?The clam soup was not too fishy and the chicken skin tasted just as you would expect it to. It's a fun time to be had by all. ?I am definitely going back and trying some fried rice balls. Side note PS thing: if you are facing the restaurant you'll see another yakitori place to your right about 2 stores down. ?It's the same thing so if the line is too long at one just go to the other. ?After having this restaurant be such a huge hit they opened a second store front to deal with the massive crowds. ?You'll frequently see the staff go between the two and I think they may be connected in the back near the restrooms.

I can't say enough good tings about Yakitori Taisho. It's just down-to-earth, honest and delicious food. The restaurant is tiny and often crowded, but it just adds to the appeal. Don't go with too many people and try to get a seat at the bar. Most of the best offerings are in the form of meat-on-a-stick (hence Yakitori) but the other offerings especially the kimchi soup and mentai potato all quite good as well. The portions are tapas-esque and the prices quite moderate.

I adore this place and it's my favorite restaurant in New York. When you walk in, you instantly feel a rush kinetic energy, as if you're in a bustling yakitori house in Tokyo. There are guys yelling in Japanese, flinging hot oil around (they cook right behind the bar, which runs along the length of it) and handing dishes off to the servers. There are hooks mere inches from people's heads for hanging coats. If you sit at the (very cramped) bar, you're low to the ground on these little cow milking type of stools. If it's too full and you have to sit at a table in the back, you feel like you're being escorted into the storage room or back kitchen to the hidden extra space. It smells warm and delicious, the menus consist mostly of photographs of the food, and the prices are great. While I haven't actually had yakitori at this place, everything I have had is phenomenal. I've had all three types of pan fried noodle dishes, I regularly order the onigiri (usually with umeboshi), and the unagi with tamago and tofu is to die for - great portion sizes as well. Sometimes the service is a little slow, but I don't even mind because the experience is fantastic.

Can't really say i distinctly remember anything out of the food... but it was all good as anything that is unGodly in the world. I do remember the wait though. That was annoying.

Absolutely amaaaaazing!!! This is what you call yakitori heaven! ?There's sooo many options that quite frankly, we just kept ordering and ordering and ordering. ?That's how it normally goes anyways. ?Some of the faves that stuck out for me were the wasabi octopus, chicken gizzards, chicken skin, and shitake mushrooms. ?On top of these skewers just mentioned, we had probably another 15+ orders of other skewers and things of all sorts.....mmmmm yummm. 4 hungry stomaches washed down with 2 pitchers of beer and we were stuffed and ready to move on. ?Yakitori Taisho is definitely a must. ?I already know that his hole in a wall is going to be a new favorite of mine in the future.

The best way to attack this place is to go with at least 3 people, order a bunch of food and drinks, then proceed. Their entrees are solid but I think if you made use of their complete menu AND special menu, you will have a more colorful meal and you can try a ton of stuff. A lot of their dishes are cheap enough that you can eat your meal tapas style. For example, one of the times I went, I took two vegetarians there. We were able to get a bunch of greasy food but balance it out with some light/summer food. For $15 total each, we ordered, a tofu soup, okonomiyaki (you can ask to nix the pork), tuna avocado salad, cold ramen, ebi karaage with mustard mayo, and yes THE SPICY COD ROE FRIES. I've been going to this place before that, but then I came across the Taisho yelp page and heard about the fries, I made 2 attempts to go in the afternoon because I figure, shit, that's good beer food in the afternoon! But I think they close after 3? and doesn't open back up until 6pm. Bummer.... but anyway! The dip is not spicy at all, but the steak fries will burn your tongue. And the whole dish was a m a z i n g. If you order soda, don't order a medium! A medium is a pint glass with a ton of ice, but a large is literally, as, big, as, my, head. (See my profile pics) They also have a grapefruit vodka where they will arm you with half a grapefruit and a juicer so you can dump the essence into a pint glass full of vodka (and probably some tonic). I went last week again with only one other person, got one of their ginormous bento boxes, and made the mistake of ordering a medium coke.. and it just wasn't as fun. Their bento boxes takes up too much table space anyway. So yeah, bring back up, order lots, and watch your table literally run out of space.

What is this new world? ?It's an i-za-kay-a... It's a Japanese pub. Is this how they party in Japan? HOly shit, I want to go to Japan. The block is filled with them! All the bustling makes the party overflow into the streets. I feel like I can get singed just by looking at the grillers. Everything is just so gnarly. This is what punk rock means to food. It's like J-punk food. This is only my second, so I don't really know how to rate these yet. If I have to grade it on the same level as anything else I've seen in my life, I'd have to give it top notch rating. This is THE OPTIMAL Drinking environment. This is explained by tons of crazy food, lots of sake drinks, and ichiban & sapporo beer which always goes down easy. There is a good amount of seating at the bar and the back room can fit about 7 tables totaling 21 people. ?So while this IS good for groups, it is not good for many groups at the same time. ?The wait wasnt so bad, even though we spent 2 hours there, there appears to be a quick turnover, it took 15 minutes for 4 of us to get fit at a t2o person table. ? Fried oysters were ridiculous and the squid was out of it's own soft cranium. Okonomiyaki (pancake with a bunch of creatures in it) was okay but it took too long to eat and I wasn't fond of the idea of batter taking the place of beer in my stomach. I don't even know what we ordered. If I have advice for you, it is - Keep on ordering! Don't stop Don't Stop Don't stop!

Being in Boston, Yakitori Taisho is one of the places I miss most in New York. It's pretty much a hole-in-the-wall, but the food is so tasty and amazing. It's definitely not your average Americanized Japanese restaurant, as the dishes are not really for the unadventurous. Some of my usual dishes to order include the chicken skin skewers (ask for it extra crispy) and the buto mayo (pork with mayo type sauce). The place is pretty small with limited seating, it can get pretty crowded with lines out the door, and when you're done eating they won't really let you sit there for a long time and hog up valuable table space if there's a long line of people waiting. But despite all this, it's definitely worth it. Just go early (they open at 6pm) if you want to avoid the hassle.

There are few creature comforts I miss more from living in Japan than 'izakayas' -- or taverns -- where a warm, oaken decor and the requisite cacophony of an inebriated clientele is as inviting to an office worker as it is to trendsetting twentysomethings eager for rations beyond a garden variety of ramen joints. ?For the down-home warmth provided by Japan's taverns have yet to catch the eye of proprietors beyond the periphery of the Five Boroughs, my beloved Yakitori Taisho, deep within the New York groove that is the Lower East Side, is an escape from my day-to-day Gotham routine, to appreciate and recall -- from half a world away -- why eating out in Japan is always such a remarkable experience. Yakitori Taisho's always been "that" sort of place any Japanophile in the know could bring an unsuspecting novice, and showcase as their own hidden little nook along St. Mark's Place. ? If they were to publicize a "mission statement", it would likely read something like, "Good food done perfect". ?This acknowledges the food is good, but be reminded it's not haute cuisine. ?Save your appetite for miso-glazed black cod in a mirin reduction for the odd chance you get reservations at Nobu this month. No -- when you're forced to satisfy an insatiable hankering for down-home Japanese pub grub, haute cuisine comes second. ?It is here at arguably the best izakaya in all of Manhattan where you'll find the food as simple as the flavors extraordinary. It is a testament to the genius of Japanese cuisine, whereby blending the most basic of ingredients the most amazing combinations of recipes can be achieved. ?Put out of mind flashbacks of fifth grade field trips to the hibachi-style 16th century farmhouse ostensibly assembled around every American corner: this is your late-night, after work local best enjoyed with someone else. While waiting can be an arduous endeavor if you're arriving after 7 pm -- given you'll likely stand cramped alongside the counter wall navigating the coming-and-going waitstaff -- you will, at times, feel larger than a Wookiee. ?That said, once that magic moment arrives to grab some wood at the bar -- optimal to absorb the entire "izakaya" experience -- your Sapporo or Kirin Ichiban beer will begin to arrive by the pitcher. ?Any irritability you developed waiting for them to call your name -- as you were bumped around by waiter after waiter like a pinball -- will soon be washed away by one cold beer after another; along with small, savory dishes called "okazu" that're sure to please. You can't go wrong starting with any item on the menu. ?Understanding the protocol of izakaya dining cannot be emphasized enough, however, to avoid misunderstandings about what's to be eaten first or second: which is to say there is no order. ?There are no main courses and every dish should be shared as tapas would at an Argentine restaurant. ?You're just as welcome to order any number of yakitori varieties (chicken or beef skewers) initially as you're encouraged to tuck in to a heaping bowl of Hakata ramen (long, thin noodles in a succulent white, pork broth adorned with red ginger, Japanese scallions and slices of roast pork) all by yourself: you needn't worry about your friend, unless they're afraid of waiters. Chicken kara-age (fried chicken lightly breaded in panko adorned with soy sauce, garlic and scallions), yakisoba (stir-fried pasta) and katsu curry (breaded pork with curry and rice) at Yakitori Taisho are superb, and after imbibing two pitchers you might be tempted to sample a mixed drink made with shochu (a distilled beverage similar to sake). ?I generally start with the enoki bacon (bacon-wrapped string mushroom stir-fried in sake and mirin), buta kimchi (stir-fried kimchi and thin-sliced pork) or hokke (grilled flounder brushed as it's grilled with a thick soy-based marinade), while imbibing Kirin Ichiban copiously. ? As Japanese dishes such as gyoza have become popular in America, I've tasted some that're undoubtably American, and "Japanese" only in name. ?This isn't to say its lack of authenticity is the worst thing in the world; on the contrary, as the flavor of the dish is gradually enhanced and complemented with an infusion of ingredients unlikely considered when the recipe was created: this alone is a quintessential hallmark of Japanese cuisine. But at Yakitori Taisho, you will find nothing other than authentic, everyday Japanese food cooked to perfection. ?My bias favoring all things Japanese notwithstanding, Yakitori Taisho -- where exceptional food, cold beer, and a lively, laid-back crowd all can be enjoyed for a moderate fee -- will not disappoint. ?East and West fall in love and deliver an experience as cool as it gets.

Okay, I'm gonna be bias. ? I like this place, but it's not for everyone. ?This is more for the hipsters and less for the connoisseurs. ?When I think of Saint Marks, I think of Japanese hipsters, video stores, tattoes, and skewers. ?Yakitori Taisho has the skewers covered. ?I'm a huge fan of their bacon and scallops skewers (oh so squishy) and I down that sucka with pint of Calpico (apparently a "large" is pint sized, buyer beware). ?Their ramen's serves as good comfort food (still looking for a ramen place that doesn't have pork base though). ?If possible, try to get seating near the front of the restaurant because the back can get smelly.

I really want to give this place more stars, but based on the food we had during our visit, I just can't justify it. Most of the yakitori was tasty and cheap, but plum sauce on one of the chicken skewers was dreadful - so bitter we had to scrap it off in order to salvage otherwise decent pieces of meat. We liked the scallion ones the best, but they were all fairly comparable in quality. They could have used some dipping sauce - we ordered a side of the spicy roe mayo, but other options would have been nice too. The char siu with avocado was a good combination, but the Japanese pancake with squid, fish, pork, was a too heavy on the mayonnaise (granted, it was still delicious). Some of their other entrees looked tasty, but our experience with actual dishes (vs. skewers) was very hit or miss - I'd recommend determining what's good here first before swinging and missing. Service here is prompt, but space is a bit cramped.

I chose this restaurant because everyone has been saying how its cheap and good. ?I don't think it is cheap nor good! I've wanted to come here on a few other occassions but the lines were always insanely long. Last night (Tuesday night around 8pm) we finally got a break and got a table right away. ?They tried to squeeze the three of us into a two-person table, even though the table next to us was empty and remained empty for the next 20 minutes. ?It was very uncomfortable because I had to sit on the bench with my other friend and i felt like half my body was invading the table next to us (I'm a tiny girl). ?Not to mention we didn't have any room to put our jackets/bags. ?Also, there seemed to be no a/c or any ventilation so I was sweating for a good 5-10 minutes before my body temperature cooled down. So then we ordered A Set Skewers to share (chicken, chicken gizzards, chicken skin, chicken meatballs, etc). ?Cost: $13.50 for 10 skewers. ?We also got octopus balls to share as well, they were like $5.75 for 6. ?For myself, I ordered pan-fried glass noodles - $7.50 Skewers: ?Everything was really burnt and the flavor was not impactful. ?You can honestly get way better skewers from the street carts (like the ones in Flushing for $1). ?I would have to say the best one was the chicken skin (minus the burnt part), it has a very surprising taste. ?My least favorite would be the chicken meatballs - not very appetizing. ?The texture was not what I expected and it was dry. ?And flavorless. Octopus balls: ?this one was decent. ?i imagined there to be more octopus meat though. Clear noodles: ?It wasn't terrible, but it was nothing special either. ?Regular clear noodles with a few slices of pork and onions. ?Really something you can buy for like $4 at a Korean place. ?I wasn't too impressed.

Yakitori IS the epitome of the St. Mark's neighborhood. It's what St. Mark's is all about and it's the way Japanese Yakitori SHOULD be. Everything is extremely affordable and there's not a single thing you can really go wrong with that's on their menu. I've never been to Yakitori when it hasn't been packed (and it does get considerably worse in the evenings during weekends)... but service is always quick and efficient (you know how the Japanese do), so the only thing you have to be wary of is the wait to be seated.

(200th Review!!) Being in this izakaya made me felt like I was in Japan again. The restaurant is narrow and deep so if they sequester you in a corner you can hardly see outside. It's very easy to forget you're not in a dive in Tokyo or Osaka as a result. The menu is super comprehensive and we weren't disappointed with any dishes we got: - Yakitori set B (chicken meatball, chicken, beef, spring onion, 1 other) - Extra Scallop + bacon yakitori - Okonomiyaki - Soft shell crab After a pitcher of Kirin the tab came to $20 even after tip. Which seems like a great deal to me since the closest Asian alternative, anju, usually costs at least $5-10 more (since for some reason Koreans know that other Koreans in America have money, and thus charge more.) Actually, to be perfectly honest, none of the food here was THE. BEST. that I have ever had. But it didn't need to be. This is a down home neighborly izakaya with a nice crowd and decent prices. It's the working man's izakaya that lets you relax after work with a couple friends. And for me this is the true path of izakayadom. You see, in the San Francisco area, someone decided that all izakayas have to be fancy, freerange, and expensive. There is no such thing as a divey, cheap 'n' good izakaya in SF and I want one so bad. I want to make noise with my friends drinking beer. I want the armwrestling contest. I want the drinking song. I don't want the non-farmed squid. I don't (always) want the shochu from the tiny brewery on Kyushu that only makes ten cases a year. I want something more like Yakitori Taisho!!

I came here for dinner a month ago with my girlfriend. Even though we got down pre-6 PM, there was a line that took forever to get seated. Given it was a cold night and it's a small shop, being packed in tight for 25 minutes before being seated wasn't the greatest experience. The waiters are definitely in a rush to churn people through when it's crowded, so we were given our food and our check as soon as we were done. Aside from that, the food was a mixed bag. The few skewers we got were decent, although they could have used a little more time being marinated. The highlight was the bacon-wrapped scallops, which were simply decadent. Next time, I will definitely be getting a wider assortment of skewers. The o-nigiri was delicious and fresh too. In a mistake, we ended up getting the ramen here. While filling, the broth was forgettable, the noodles were a bit stiff, and the pork that was included wasn't the usual fatty goodness you get at a true ramen shop. The menu is pretty wide-ranging, and when I come back next time, I'll try out more of the Japanese meat dishes and stay away from the ramen. But it was a bit less impressive than I originally thought, and the crowded atmosphere and rushed nature of the meal made it less enjoyable as a result.

a great spot to go eat drink and chill!!! If your in the east village and feeling a bit hungry this is a goto spot..!! space is a little tight but its ok..!! Just sit and take a load off. Great little spot with a long wait if you go at the right time.

As a drunk dining destination, this place totally works. It's cheap, it's open late, it's loud, and a lot of the food is undoubtedly better for you than a greasy slice. But as a yakitori-ya? Gimme a break. All the virtues that it has at 3am do not justify the praise that has been heaped on its food. For yakitori (and overall quality of everything else on the menu), there's just no comparison between Taisho and a place like Totto. I've had yakitori just the same as Taisho at tiny little nomiya in Shinjuku, which is to say it's solid but unremarkable. I'd give it three stars because you come here because it's late and you're hungry and it's perfect for that, plus it's better than some other options out there in that situation, but during those times, it's usually really crowded, and it's really not worth waiting around very long for a table.

I haven't had yakitori enough times to make a clear assessment on quality/taste. ?But, after eating at Taisho on a trip up to NYC, I've gained a new ambition to try as many good yaki places as possible this year. Our night actually began at Hagi (yeah, I'm a sucker for Bourdain joints), but the wait was an hour, so we decided to make the trek over to Taisho. ?Unfortunately, there was also quite a queue at Taisho when we arrived and we ended up having to wait 45 mins for a table of 4. ?My expectations were dwindling with each min of waiting, but they finally called our party and we hungrily sat at our table on the dinky stools. Based on Yelper's recommendations, we ordered the fries w/ mentai sauce. ?Unfortunately, I told the server that we would like fries w/ HENTAI sauce, but to his credit, he kept a straight face. ?We also ordered edamame and 20 sticks of assorted yaki consisting of chicken, chicken balls, chicken gizzards, shrimp, and the like. ?The fries came out tongue-singeingly hot and slightly crunchy which I like and the cod roe mayo was a revelation. ?I think I could dip pieces of cardboard in that glorious pink stuff and it would taste good. ?Next came the yaki which was a mound of sticks that didn't look quite a large as I had expected, but this is basically Japanese bar food, after all. ?All of the sticks were really tasty with a great smoky flavor(especially the chicken), but the gizzards were somewhat chewy and I ended up eating 2 sticks of them since no one else in my group liked them. The check ended up being the biggest surprise. ?Who would have thought this much great food in a popular NYC place would cost so little? All in all, a great meal. By the way, does anyone know what is in that glorious sauce??It tasted like mayo, cod roe, and sriracha...

~Setting~ This tiny cramped hole in the wall that must have violated at least 30 fire hazard, safety, and sanitation codes lives at the heart of St.Marks's . The tables are way too small for the amount of people they try to stuff, party of four? They have a tall coffee table just for you. During the summer it get really stuffy, cramp, and hot in the back. ~Food~ A friend once told me "Even a village idiot can't mess up yakitori; it's just meat on sticks." He was right. Although, this place was rundown,crazy hot, and busy it still was able to provide decent grilled food. The price is much cheaper than other kushiyaki places but you get what you pay for. For instance the bacon asparagus at Yakitori Taisho has a lot of fat while going to Soba Totto you get less fatty, meaty bacon slice. ~Service~ One should not expect good service when coming to St. Marks, and this is exactly the same mentality you need for this place. It takes about 15 minutes after seating to get your drink orders in another 10 to get the drinks and another 5 to get someone to finally take your food order. Need another round of something? Don't hold your breath. ~Conclusion~ If you're on a budget, want yakitori, and ok with waiting then come here. If you're able to afford more, I highly recommend another kushiyaki place like Soba Totto or Yakitori Torys, they have better service, ambiance, and food.

Been a while since I haven't tipped a full 20%...I respect the service industry. ? Here are the reasons why I didn't do that here: 1. The first thing the waiter said to me was I couldn't eat my yan-yan in the restaurant (for those of you who don't know what that is, it's like asian dunkaroos, with sticks instead of kangaroos). ?He then proceeded to card us incredulously when we ordered a beer, like we were a couple of teenagers (I'm 25). 2. Crammed and loud don't even begin to describe the atmosphere in the back. 3. The food took forever. ?This is when I missed my yan-yan the most. 4. The yakitori was just okay. ?I enjoyed the chicken and the pork...the rest (chicken balls, shrimp, beef, bacon/asparagus) I didn't particularly care for. 5. The check took forever. 6. Did I mention the service was slow and rude? I used to like this place, but that was when I first moved to the city. ?Now, there are just too many other great places to spend my money (and time).

This place is only good when it's busy since they tend to cook up certain skewers, so they have them on hand. I was not impressed with my second time there. First review... I was really impressed with this place since we had a small group attend. The place was bustling and seemed like it would never stop, but alas, we were done and stuffed to the max. I ordered the tofu miso since they were out of the miso clam soup. This was a true disappointment since I was sold on the idea of these two items meshing together. We also ordered the grilled beef cubes on the summer special menu and this was soooo awesome! I would have been fine with just this dish for dinner! In addition, we ordered the yakitori combo B and added a skewer of fried chicken skin (kawa), which was soooo good! I was a bit disappointed with fried rice wrapped around salmon. The flavor was too fishy for me. Overall - not bad!

The closest thing to Tokyo street food, but it's not as cheap. ?The yakitori is delicious and BURSTING with flavor and juice. ?Bring a few friends so you can all share something, even though it means you only get half a skewer. ?I tried a lot of other things on the menu. The okonomiyaki was done well and had good flavor, but it's an acquired taste. ?Not enough green onions, though. ?The takaoyaki is NOT good, the piece of octopus is the size of my pinky fingernail. ?A complete waste of money. ?The grilled squid was good and very chewy. ?The onigiri isn't that great, the rice is the wrong consistency and texture, and there isn't too much meat/ume inside. ? However, this is a yakitori restaurant, so I am giving the most weight on their yakitori. ?Get in around 6 and you won't wait. ?Give me chicken skin skewers NOW.

Whenever I go to NYC, I HAVE to go to this place, and for one reason: The chicken skin on skewers and the HUGE eff'in cups they give you when you order a drink. okay that was two, but man.. the chicken skin.. I can't find that ANYWHERE. I mean we have little Tokyo in LA and a Japanese section in Santa Monica, but I can't find that mouthful of heart attack anywhere. It gets totally packed. Last time, we were waiting outside, and the "Truth" people came and filmed my friend Rai for an anti-smoking commercial. He collapsed his lung dancing, but he said it was because of his previous smoking habit. But back to the chicken skin skewers.

This place screams YAKITORI the moment you enter through the narrow doors of the semi-basement restaurant. It's packed at 1am with yakitori-crazed customers, 60% of which are japanese youngsters. The smoke-filled restaurant heightened your urge to bite into the skewered delicacies of japanese-style grilled meat of a hundred variety including crispy chicken skin, fish and beef. It's the perfect midnight snack when you're sleepless in NYC. Four thumbs up and all 3 visits were very much worth it!

After a long work day? Crazy shopping? Or just needing a ?chill spot to down a beer or 2 with the homies? This is it! I've been coming to NYC for years now, and more than half of the time, I'd make every dying efforts to make it here each time! No joke. Kirin Ichiban never tastes so good, and they have it on tap now! Whaaaa?? Order some sake, whatever you fancy, my personal fave is ozeki nigori---to go w the beer. Hands down....you forget about the world. Atmosphere- 5. I love the unpretentious, laid-back vibe. For New yorkers, this is the norm, but for us out of towners--we feel the authencity in this place. The awesome staff are all Japanese, no dress code, wood stools all around the open grill (my preference). The line already forms at the entrance before it even opens, but staff will get you in, if you got some patience. Service- 5. For a small hole-in-the-wall, their service is impeccable. Always on stand-by for your every need, and they work quick. Ask them anything, and they'll help you as much as they can. Super sweet folks. Food- 5. Where can I start? Try everything. I'm not so big on all the yakitori [only certain ones], but the rest of their menu is awesome. My faves? The salmon carpaccio, tempura squid (love their tempura dough!), tempura cheese fingers, grilled hokke fish, & chicken meatballs. I've tried a lot more, just dont remember them all. See ya soon!

This place is super fun, you feel like you're in Japan in an authentic izakaya- the staff all shout in japanese, the environment is extremely lively- the food is pretty good for japanese pub food but nothing amazing I'd say you go here more for the atmosphere and drinks however, avoid the fried pork don- the sauce was overly sweet food is cheap but they are mostly small appetizers so order more than you think you can eat!

I had heard about the french fries with the tobiko mayo from a friend of mine and lo and yowza! They're great! I see that Vicky in a previous review thinks so too! I think the menu calls them MENTAI FRENCH FRIES. We ended up ordering an extra side of the roe mayo and it cost only a $1. We got to Taisho waaaay late. Like... the server kept saying, "We close in 10 minutes" every 15 seconds. But 9 of us had just gotten out of work from another restaurant and we were starving. So we ordered up a ton of food and man... did that food fly out of the kitchen fast! We bought the kitchen a pitcher of beer and proceeded to stuff our faces full. A couple of stand out items besides the Mentai French Fries.... KIMCHEE YAKIUDON. Big plate of noodles stir-fried with kimchee. Good, filling... spicy drunk food. We had FRIED CHICKEN pieces which were NOT golden brown but a sort of white and gray looking mass.... It was damn tasty though! The TAKOYAKI was fantastic. Sooooo good especially with extra mayo. Actually the mayo tasted really good with the fried chicken too. I had a bowl of TONKATSU RAMEN and the noodles were perfectl. Unfortunately I was so full that I couldn't eat any of the YAKITORI that was ordered for the table. It looked very good though! The place is a little divey and our seating situation was really cramped but I'd definitely go back again. And yeah... those fries would be the first thing I order.

Ever since my dear friend Paul introduced me to this spot, I have always made it a point to visit again and again whenever I'm in NYC. I would go into the delicious details of the piping hot ramen noodles or the overwhelming array of Japanese kebabs, but the native reviewers have covered it much better than my hazy memory can at the moment. The verdict: It's relatively inexpensive, it's got character, and it serves up a great meal. Go there if you haven't already!

I think Yakitori is a bit hyped up and overrated. ?We ordered a bunch of dishes and I was not pleased; in fact, I was even less pleased when we got the bill. ? We ordered Combo A (chicken, chicken skin, chicken gizzard, chicken meat ball, pork), and the only thing worthwhile is the chicken meatball. ?The chicken was dry, the chicken skin and pork were so fatty. ?Don't ask me about the chicken gizzard since I didn't try it :) ?The grilled rice ball with salmon was ok - the taste was very bland and the salmon did not taste fresh at all. ?On the bright side, I liked the mentai potato (french fries with roe/mayo sauce) and the sauce is excellent. ?Also, the tako yaki (octopus balls) were good. Oh in terms of drinks...I like their extensive cocktail menu. ?I had the frozen green apple cocktail, and it's decent. ?At first it was strong, but I was able to handle it later.

The good stuff was really good (chicken, chicken meatball, spicy cod roe mayo + fries) The okay stuff missed the mark (overcharred shrimp in shell, overcooked and tough beef).

After stocking up on a season's worth of striped socks, my sister and I went to Taisho to stuff ourselves silly. ?The best dishes were the ones with filler ingredients: ?chicken meatball yakitori, octopus balls, and okonomiyaki. ?(The grilled meats were sadly overdone -- much too tough, much too chewy.) Tried out their soju special (our sampling included sesame, sweet potato, rice, barley, brown sugar). ?The sesame was pleasant, as were the pricier sweet potato and rice versions. ?With soju, there does seem to be a positive correlation between cost and quality of drink.

want to get a taste of authentic cheap yakitori? head to YT. the actual venue is like one long hallway, with a small space in the back and an even smaller space behind the kitchen area. if i could i wouldn't even bother bringing a coat or a bag. their buta kimchee alone satisfies my cravings. however, here are some requisite noms: -takoyaki (octopus balls..no not literal you goober) -this AWESOME tuna sashimi salad -okonomiyaki (savory pancake with shrimp and other yummy things) -ikayaki (grilled squid) -asari butter (clams in butter) -fries (comes with spicy roe and mayo...don't fight it) -tatsua age (fried chicken) -and of course, their namesake, yakitori. first timers, get the sampler, it's pretty good. as for drinks, they offer a VARIETY of different sakes/beer, but my favorite has to be the calpico (sake + the fruity calpico drink you MUST try). the only downside to this place is that the food tends to be very salty. be prepared to wash it down with a cold beer or shot of sake (if you get sake, get it WARMED).

Yes, you will wait up to a ?hour for a table. (And by table, I mean child-sized bench with accompanying foot stools to sit on.) And yes, your order will take forever (So be patient and listen to the drunken ?Japanese and/or French pirate music they're playing on the speakers.) And yes, the bathrooms are sketchy, cramped, unisex and hard to find. But once you pair up the tender roasted meats-n-veggies with cold bottles of saki, all troubles will be lifted. My suggestion; pick out 6-10 different skewers and only order many skewers as there are people so everyone can sample; eg 6 people = 6 chicken meatball, 6 shrimp, 6 mushroom, etc. That way, when you're ready for round two, everyone will have a better idea of what they like/don't like/want to order copious amounts of. Oh, and no visit to Tashio is complete without fries with the spicy roe mayo. YAY for late night Japanese street food!

Came here late one night for some grub after drinking at continental. The place has the charm of being like an authentic rest. from Japan. We were seated in the small hidden room in the back and while it was tight (there was about 15 of us) it was cute. The food itself was pretty average.. the portions were not as large as other Japanese restaurants. I shared the chicken teriyaki and it was good.. nothing out of the ordinary to write about though. The service was average and the bathroom is tiny!

Yakitori Saves Lives! Ok, well maybe not, but anything's possible right? Taisho's gotta be the best drunk food around. Great yakitori, onigiri, okinomiyaki...it's all great. You can always find this place by the hoardes of Asian folk standing outside, waiting to get in. Once in, the quarters are kinda cramped, and you may find yourself making new friends with the person sitting next to (on) you. Prices won't break the bank, so you can afford to have a little fun before hand. Have an impromptu date? Hit Taisho. Oh, and if it is too packed, they just opened a second shoppe, almost identical, two doors down. Banzai!!!

If you're around St. Marks enough to sample every restaurant (including the Chipotle down the block, ugh!), you may end up at Yakitori Taisho more than once. The concept of skewering (the concept of Yakitori) just about every imaginable, acceptably edible (some not, to Americans) substance can leave someone quite profoundly confused (Beef Guts anyone?). But that's part of the entire fascination with this restaurant, just about everything skewered comes to your table tasting pretty good (I personally think Yakitori Totto's fare might be slightly better prepared). The menu isn't limited to just Yakitori as about anything Japanese can be had. I personally enjoy ordering up some fries with Wasabi mustard/sauce. If only the first time I hadn't gone with some pretentious strangers who ended up leaving a $75 tip on a $150 bill (I got stuck meeting a friend's new BF who brought his friends along) for a wait staff that isn't quite the friendliest (tho not rude or downright unacceptable service). But be warned, the place is small and more than 3 around their tiny kiddie tables can make for a messy, elbowing experience! Then again, I think it's well worth your time and effort. 4 stars!

Fabulous! A wide variety of bizarro dishes for your taste delight. I especially recommend the fresh grapefruit cocktail. For only $6, you get an actual grapefruit half brought to your table, which you juice yourself and pour into a premixed cocktail. There's also a vegetarian platter that's quite good and quite filing - a variety of sauteed vegetables, a salad, noodles, and the like.

I really really wanted to like this place, but I just didn't. ?This spot has been on my radar for awhile and I finally convinced my fiance to come here with me for dinner. ?This place seems very authentic and so we decided to order a bunch of stuff that we don't normally eat. We came on a Tuesday night around 7:30 pm and were seated right away. ?We split a pitcher of Kirin for about $13. ?We split several skewers of Yakitori to start: squid legs, mushrooms, scallops w/bacon, chicken skin and the last one was a mystery (I think it was chicken gizzards). ? I really like squid, but this was not good. ?I don't even know how to describe it. ?They were scrawny squid legs and I just tasted a lot of cartilage. ?The mushrooms were served cold, gross. ?The scallops w/bacon were grossly undercooked; the scallops were kind of slimy. ?The mystery yakitori was disgusting, all cartilage, I had to literally spit it out. ?The chicken skin was pretty awesome, though. ? My fiance felt so ill after the yakitori. We also split the Harusame Itame (pan-fried glass noodles with pork veggies) and it was completely bland, no flavor at all. ?Then we had some sort of Japanese styled steak which was cut into cubes. ?This was pretty good, but I already felt so gross from what I ate prior that I could barely enjoy this.

The yakitori at this place is delicious. I especially like the laid back, almost like a hole in the wall atmosphere with much character to it. I tried almost everything on the menu and I liked most of the items. There are several items that I liked more than others are mushroom skewers, quail eggs, gizzards. It is also neat to watch the chefs do their thing while you eat. Aside from the delicious food, this place is open very late! This place can get VERY crowded, but that is part of the charm of this restaurant. If you happen to be in NYC, it is definitely worth checking this place out.

A bit pricey and cramped but that's to be expected at any Japanese restaurant. We got seated for a party of 6 in ~15minutes which is not bad on a albeit rainy Saturday night. You flip open the menu and one thing becomes clear. They specialize in skewers, and skewers they DO specialize in. They are absolutely delicious. I got Set B (10 skewers for ~14$) and I was blown away of how good meat on a stick could be. The meatballs, scallions, beef, and shrimp were outstanding. The chicken was a bit dry though. I also got the Taishodon, which in itself is more than enough to feed one person, and it comes with skewers as well. Served with miso soup, kimchee, and daikon, it was the subtle flavorings on the rice that made this dish superb...not to mention the giant bowl of a portion that makes Taishodon a good bang for your buck. We also got a pitcher of Sapporo beer for 12.50$ which isn't bad at all, especially if you split it 4 ways with your friends. Glasses were frosted, beer was cold, and Sapporo is always nice. Fantastic. If the chicken wasn't so tough and dry, easily 5 stars. Oh, if you are a bathroom person (which come on...its NYC and you're eating at an Asian establishment) don't be expecting a Hilton styled bathroom. It is small and cramped but relatively clean and gets the job done.

After just two visits, this has literally become my favorite place in New York to eat. It reminds me of a place I visited when I was in Japan. It's tiny, cramped and full of charm. The workers are all afro-centric japanese, dreads, baggy pants. Just fucking cool. Amazing music is always blasting, old school hip hop, traditional japanese and the occasional soul jam. It's always packed but worth the wait. Huge selection of tasty dishes that are cheap and come out fast. I can't say much else but if you're gonna go here, go with friends, sit at the bar, order some Asahi and try the chicken skins and green onions. OH the green onions.

O'Yakitori Taisho! Dai-suki desu! This is some of the finest japanese grilled meats to be found in the city. Definitely get some of the scallions (negima) and bacon on a stick - what a wonderful treat! Or get some squid (ika) and smile as it squeaks when you chew it. The chicken skin (kawa) is definitely something to try if you are unfamiliar with it. WIth plenty of nama beeru available or tasty Calpico freezes this is just such a good place to go and keep ordering little plates of food until you can eat no more. If you sit at the bar in the front you can watch the cooks at work. Marvel at their hot oil marked skin as they toil away to prepare tasty tasty food for you.

Sure there's a wait, but it's worth it. ?The smiling, dread-locked staff will lead you through a ?snug gauntlet of workday refugees and tray-teetering waiters. When you're just about overwhelmed with the pulsing throng, they'll plant you 'round whichever hand-carved pine table opens up first. I'm tickled that Yakitori offers "traditional" bar fare with a Japanese twist. ?I'd only be too happy to trade a pickled egg for one of Yakitori's smokey, grilled Quail's ?egg skewers. I'd wash it down with a sweet pint of Sapporo. ?Their fries are featured on not one but on THREE pages of their menu, 'cause they're paired with a fish roe mayo that's just THAT good. I'd call that dinner.

How can anyone resist walking past St.Marks without stopping by to get something to eat? Well, I can't...and if I do, I die a little inside. What's it about birthdays that the older you get, the less exciting birthdays get..? I'm not sure about that but Yakitori Taisho was probably the best birthday celebration decision I've made since god knows when. The irony of the skewers lie between the fact that they're probably the most known but I ordered too many non-skewer dishes to have any room left in my stomach to order skewers. The shrimp and steak dishes my friend and I ordered were so good regardless of the fact that we were crammed into two seats in the corner of the back of the restaurant. There was literally no space for the waiter to come take our orders...we had to scream it to them. What a view. CON. Also, I had no room to put my bag and etc, it sat on my lap the whole time I was there. TIP: Get there early. Basically, besides the limited amount of space and the possibility that you'll get seated in the corner next to the exit at the back, the food is great and the waiters are friendly.

THE place to go in New York. People keep raving about this place so we finally went. Friend and I ordered set B along with 5 other things. EVERYTHING was amazing. The food was carefully prepared and was bursting with flavor. It's the kind of meal that makes you wish you were Japanese. The one thing that perhaps didn't live up to par was the tempura ice cream. Good concept but wasn't anything special. I'd get another stick of beef before I get that. The place is very small and you might have to wait for a while. Also like other typical popular NYC restaurants you'll almost be sitting on someone elses lap. Trust me no matter how ugly they are it'll be worth it.

The only thing going for this place is that it's a "street food" kind of restaurant. Personally, I didn't particularly enjoy the flavors, but my wife did. ? Most of the food was standard fare, grilled chicken, grilled squid, etc. ?Their "crispy chicken skin" wasn't crispy at all and winded up grossing me out. The bacon wrapped scallop was rushed and the bacon was raw. The bar was filthy and the rags they were using to wipe stuff down with was absolutely gross. And they had this highly annoying habit of yelling all the time. Ugh! All in all, I will never remind my wife of this place and I hope she ne'er remembers it.

Great, Hole in the wall, restaurant! inexpensive and good eats. if you have a ?problem about sitting next to someone in a small room or in general have a thing about tight spaces- NOT the right place for you!

No need to add much to the long list of raving about this place - suffice it to say, I found this place late in my time in New York, and rue not having found it sooner. My mouth waters just thinking about the smell when you walk in, and I can't wait until I can return . . . It doesn't matter how cold it is outside, or how long the wait is, it's worth it - DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE, YOU WILL REGRET IT!

Our friend introduced this place to us this past week while visiting NYC. ? We wish they had a place like this in San Francisco because I would go there all the time. ?Great place to go for comfort food Japanese style. ?BBQ food on skewers are the best. ?These guys even make bbq green onions taste good. ?Give the beef tongue, and chicken skin a try. ?You will not be dissapointed and you can tell everyone that you ate grilled tongue and chicken skin. The okonomyaki (japanese pancake) is a must order. Go there for lunch, dinner, after dinner, dessert, go there go there and go there. I would have given this place 5 stars but I had to buy new clothes because I couldn't get the BBQ smell out, ?but that won't stop me from going back again. MAN..... I wished they had this place here in SF. =) ?Enjoy

Adventurous? Check this place out. ?Chicken hear scewers, grilled squid, beef tongue, if it was part of the animal and tastes good they have it. ?They also have some not-so-crazy items for the weaker stomach but I always love to try new things so I went all out. ?Pitchers of Japanese beer were pretty cheap (by Manhattan prices), they also have a respectable sake list. Crazy busy so expect to wait, but definitely worth it. Also a great place to grab a small snack if the place isn't packed. ?Just grab a skewer or two of your favorites for just a couple of bucks. ?Nice thing about this place is you can spend as little or as much as you like, 3 people stuffed with second helpings with beer for about $70.

Wow. I can never get sick of this place. ?Just thinking of it makes me instantly hungry. ?I was introduced back in 06 and I've been an addict ever since. Sometimes their service is a little slow but can you blame them, look how busy it is. My suggestions : 1) Yaki Unagi roll- ?My absolute fav. Its like a eel roll just GRILLED. its awesome 2) Salmon Yakisoba- ?Salmon and salmon cream yakisoba noodles.

Maybe this place has lost its luster or coming on a Wednesday night during a downpour could have had something to do with it. Expecting lines of people out of the door, we were automatically seated as we entered the cavernous room. No doubt if you are claustrophobic, you may want to go elsewhere as the ceiling are rather low. The menu is expansive and I had to inquire with the waiter what was worth ordering. I am a newbie to the skewered meat s thing so I had to see what was the most popular. He insisted we should get the fried cheese skewers and some of the other things which I can hardly remember. Yes, the meal was that unmemorable. Luckily I was able to wash it down with some cold Japanese beer.

Super crowded in an already tight space, it just shows how popular this place is. ?People will wait forever long for a table and when they finally get one they'll deal with being squished together and having the staff repeatedly squeeze by to get to the tables they're serving. ?We sure did. ?And more than once in my short time in NY. Good stuff we loved: grilled chicken teriyaki - tasty saucy sauce grilled squid grilled pork spare ribs grilled chicken skin - delicious, but grossed me out when i thought about it too much meatballs - yep, asian meatballs. chicken skewers beef skewers No good: japanese pancake (although one friend thought it was the best ever) fried avocado/eel sushi roll (really mushy gross) Everyone was really friendly and not at all annoyed that we kept having to squish late-joining friends at our table (causing even more aisle blockage). *If you plan to split the bill, you may want to keep a mental tab of what you owe cause it's gonna be in Japanese. If you're in the St. Marks area, try it.

It's great! Boyfriend and I had set A (the one that doesn't have veggie) and various other little things tonight. Food: Greatest part. Set A was good. I didn't like the beef (tongue?) in particular but boyfriend loved it, so it worked out :) Ocha Zuke was delicious but it was not with tea (it seemed like a soup). I had chicken hearts and livers :p they are good if you like that sort of thing. Chasyo Tonkotsu Ramen was tasty too but the noodle itself was different (harder) than the ramen I had elsewhere, and as a result it was only ok. Chuhi was greaaat :D The place was a bit crowded but that's ok. I think it's good for groups and late night. It's good for young people in general. I looked forward to squid legs and shishamo... but they ran out :( price is very reasonable! overall it was great and I definitely look forward to visiting again.

The guest i brought got water spilled on top of her head! I took her here because they have good food, however it is small. And i felt terrible that it had to happen to her as her first impression. We had just finished dinner as a huge party sat down next to us. The waitress was serving them waters and had the tray over my friends head. She lost balance and spilled one of the glasses on my friend and on the back of the party she was serving. The ?waitress (she's the one with the dreads) apologized a billion times and offered napkins, but the after the incident didn't return for awhile to give us our bill. We had to hail down another waiter to bring it to us, in this busy restaurant. Not only was it embarrassing to have water spilled on her, we also had to get up to get our check?! To ?top it off you would think they would think they wouldn't have her pay her share of the bill. All they did was offer her 10% off! WHAT AN INSULT!!! We stood in the small hallways between the front and back with my friend still wet, waiting for the server to work things out with the manager, as if there was anything to discuss. She finally got the approval to deduct her meal. Although it was a mistake, the restaurant made no attempt to correct it. Which is what really pissed me off. We had a good meal and a good time before it happened, but all of that went to the crapper. This incident happened beginning of fall, and i never reviewed the place because i tried to forget it, until i passed by last night and it was rather empty.

Step down into Yakitori Taisho, and once you can get a seat in this almost claustrophobic place, they will serve you some pretty good dishes. Our party of 3 didn't actually have to wait too long to be seated, but please, be careful navigating the restaurant. There will be people on the sides of you, so watch how you flail those arms and jackets. There are a few tables in front, a bar in the center, and then a few more tables in the rear. There really is a pretty wide variety of dishes to order--I must have changed my order in my head at least 3 times while trying to decide. I settled on two chicken skewers, this fried shrimp dish served with sweet mustard, and a miso soup. The shrimp was so good, and I wish I could have put that mustard on everything. In fact, I put my skewers in the leftover sauce. When I stole a bite of my friend's chicken teriyaki, where do you think it went? Right in that sauce. I should have asked to get some extra. Miso soup was good and cloudy. Everyone seemed to like their food, and the only sour point at all was a bit of a lull between when we were seated and given water/soju, and when our order was finally taken. A minor inconvenience, but not one that I'll hold on to tightly. Good food, and the prices aren't bad either, but I see myself having to order a lot to get full. My food didn't fill me for very long at all. It's a solid 4. Go eat!

I'm always a fan of cheap eats and this place is exceptional, ?all kinds of suff grilled on skewers ranging from ?bacon wrapped enoki, to chicken livers ( and all of it delicious). ? The thing to do is is go before the big evening rush and secure a table. ?Once there I recommend rolling ordering where you just keep getting skewers and small plates. ?The real standouts are the bacon wrapped quail eggs, the grilled squid ( one of the best I've ever had), and the duck skewers. ? There are a number of larger plates, but ?I think you should stick to the snacks. ?That said, it's pretty tough to go wrong with this divey kushiyaki house

First off, this review is waaaaaaaaaaaaay overdue! I've long loved watching food specials in Japan that take place in Izakaya's and always wondered what the grilled foods on skewers Really tasted like... I finally got my chance thanks to NY's very own Yakitori Taisho... Small, cramped, warm, wooden, aromatic, social, drunk, sober, hungry, broke, sochu, ahhh soooo GOOD! Stephanie and I wandered in here after a happy hour binge to celebrate my new job. ?I ordered the Dinner set A since I was feening to eat some sort of meat meat and more meat rather than vegetables. ?The marinade or basting sauce was amazing. ?Each piece of chicken was flavorful juicy and tender! ?The chicken skin was to D-I-E for! ? I'd love to come in here during a cold winter just for the coziness of it all!

Platter B skewers are the best I think. Also had the huge pancake thing which tasted a bit like mush without really being able to identify the ingredients. I was thinking maybe potato and cabbage? Tasty nonetheless. Anyway, also had the fried squid and agedashi tofu (very good). This was the first time I tried Kirin beer and I definitely liked! It's not as bitter as Sapporo and is very light and refreshing on a hot summer day. Seems like there is only one big table in the front so don't go with a large party (8-10 people). The place is pretty tight.

YUMMMMmmmm!!! Busy, fun environment. I love this place. When I lived in nyc, I'd come here 2-3 times a week. The prices are fair for nyc. expect to spend 10-20 each. no sushi here, just japanese bbq, and some other great plates. Expect to wait as it is crowded full of students. The cooks sit right there near the bar. Stools are wood, tables are thick wood. Good place for groups of 2-6. anymore becomes a challenge.

Yakitori has been my cheap, delicious, unbelievably satisfying go-to meal for years. ?And I really don't see that changing anytime in the near future. ?On those nights where I don't feel like cooking or paying out my ass for mediocre food, this is the joint. ? Between the skewers, any variety of dumpling, takoyaki [just try it!] or any other deep fried, steaming hot concoction [with the handy little menu notation "SPEED" next to the items that can be prepared, well you know, real quick] that they come up with, I have never had anything on the menu that I didn't like. ? And it's cheap! ?Dirt cheap for NYC standards! ?Like, unbutton the top button of your pants filling for less than $25 a person, alcohol included! ?Don't pass up on the sake, beer or extra large frozen vodka drinks that they serve; they all contribute to the overall vibe of the place. Be prepared to wait most nights of the week and be prepared to wait and wait and wait on the weeknights. ?Your patience will be rewarded if you're looking for the closest thing to Japanese comfort food that you can find. The waitresses aren't going to coddle you, but they'll serve your food efficiently and leave you alone to enjoy your food. ?Sit at the bar for an always entertaining view of your food being made. Oh and to the person down there claiming there's some kind of racial discrimination going on, I call bullshit. ?I'm not Asian and neither are a lot of the customers at Yakitori, and while I have waited lengthy amounts of time for a table [as did every other person around me, Asian or not], I have never NOT gotten a seat eventually. ?Patience ain't called a virtue for nothing.

I came here for dinner with J before the Blue Man Group show. The place is tiny but busy. We ordered a bunch of food. For the yakitori, we ordered the beef tongue, chicken heart, chicken gizzard (we were feeling adventurous). Also, we ordered the taisho style steak and tako yaki. The food came quickly, and it was surprisingly good. The beef tongue is a little tough to chew, but everything else was tasty. We had ordered rice, but it never came, however, the dishes weren't that salty so it did not really affect our experience...(give us extra stomach to enjoy some delicious yogurt nearby at pinkberry). All in all, it is a great place and I would definitely come back again.

The best skin chicken yakitori ever... I been to this place more than 20 times, order different menu, all are very very good... Very good food and fast food style, so don't ever expect good service, this place only for rush food and no service, kind of ugly place if you judge from the decoration and bathroom... but the taste of the food are beyond... so if you hungry and only for food this is the best place to go. Not the place for romantic dinner or place to hang out or chill out with some good friends... Eat and out this the concept... This is New Yorkers style, times is money...

The Bad - Small portions, expensive price for normal food - Forgot one of the order and cancelled it themselves - Was sat literally in the corner (a squishy triangular corner near the exit) - Horrible service (waiter gave my order to the table next to us--- no refill on water the whole time we were there) - Eel avocado sushi that looked good was horrible (looks are deceiving!!-- tastes nothing like sushi) The Good - Creamy salmon noodle thing was probably the highlight of the whole dinner - Ebi skewer was good - Chicken skin one was good too - Mushroom one was decent (nothing special-- I mixed it with the creamy salmon noodle) The Bottomline- Okay place to try....don't see what's so awesome about this place though....i expected some sushi at least lol

I absolutely LOVE it here!!! Last summer, my friend from out-of-town came for a visit, and we were in the neighborhood. She was on a budget, and when we passed by, I had remembered the rave reviews about this place. We went in right when it opened, and immediately, we loved the place. Yes, it's a small place, hole-in-the-wall, and if you're not a fan of people being all up in your space, then maybe this isn't for you. We ordered a grilled salmon rice ball, unagi tofu (eel, tofu, egg in special sauce), yakitori meal A (chicken, chicken skin, chicken gizzard, chicken meat ball, pork skewers). It was all absolutely delicious!! And the meal was so filling that we really had to force ourselves to finish. My friend loved it so much that she made me take her back here the following day! Ever since my experience here, I've taken a number of people here, and they've all loved it here. Service has always been great - attentive, friendly and very helpful. When I've come here with one or two other people, the bill never goes over $40. And so, since I was here the other night and come here pretty often, I remembered to make a review of this place. My favorite items on the menu: skewers (Kawa - chicken skin, Hotate Bacon - bacon with scallop, Enoki Bacon - bacon with enoki mushroom), unagi tofu, grilled squid, and kalbi. Of course, beer with great company is a must. I absolutely love this place, and if you decide to check it out too, hopefully you'll love it as much as I do. :)

CONS: *Revolting food -- and I do mean that in a literal sense. It gave me food poisoning. I'm not sure how food that greasy was also so bland. I would have expected (and accepted) a heavy hand with seasoning. *Service was non-existent. We went through the entire meal with no water refill; we actually asked for and received our check from the host while he fussed over the wait-list clipboard. The only time we saw our waitress was the very beginning when she took our order and then brought it to the table. No points, Yakitori Taisho.

There was quite a wait for our group of 7. First we had 5 people and the wait was 1 hour, then we added another person and the wait was 1.5 hours, and all of sudden the 7th person decides to show up and we ended up waiting for 2 hours. The wait is insane and the food just didn't make up for the long wait. Although this place is small it's good for groups. Finally, 2 hours has elapsed and we were transported to a room all the way in the back, which I wouldn't have known existed if we had sat in front of the restaurant. This place is like a long skinny hallway and they use every available space they can to fit more people than they really should. It's a down-to-earth, fun type of atmosphere where you can order a large pitcher of beer and share a table full of small plates and desserts. My opinions about the food: 1. Yakitori Sets - Not much flavor, over grilled. 2. Pancake - Mushy texture, weird taste. 3. Duck - Pretty good. 4. Squid Balls - Not bad. 5. Fried Oysters - Had better. 6. Squid - Okay. 7. Pork & Veg. Noodles - Had better. 8. Tempura Ice Cream - Good. 9. Green Tea Br?lée - Very good, nice twist on the classic dessert Overall, decent food, wide selections, quick service, reasonable prices, loud, and a cool crowd.

Its very small and you feel like you are going into the past, in japan. And somehow the Japanese people of the past are still more advanced then the people of today. I came here under the suggestion of two friends and had one of the most ?unique meals ever. Excellent for those on a diet, as everything is pretty much carb free. We had the squid, and set b and a grilled rice ball. Everything was delicious, especially the chicken meat balls.

Pros: Good food, just like it is in Japan Cons: Small and cramped Thoughts: One thing about this place is how much it can remind you of a small restaurant in Japan. Everyone is cramped into a very small space while the smell of barbecued skewers linger into your clothing. This is one of those places that even if the waitress tells you it's going to be an hour wait, you'll wait while admiring what St Marks have to offer. They have many options on their skewers even chicken skin, which is probably one of the most demanded. Try it, it will be an experience you won't forget.

Extremely casual and sometimes very hard to get a table. Everytime I go to NY this place is a msut. ?Maybe its the unhearlded tradition of the endless flow of sake and beer and drives me to this place or the large tasty chicken meatballs. ?Something about this place oozes local hole in the wall! Food is great staff is always busy. ?Extremely small. ?There is a newer oh! Taishos that opened a few years ago directly next door. ?Let me tell you though this palce is by far much better! ?Something about the old grills that look like a sticky mess that simply adds flavor to every juicy meatball. You can order just about any kind of skewered meat you can think of. Give it a go! Tahishos!

I've never been to Japan, but I've heard that this place is pretty authentic. ?My date also thought it was expensive, but I thought it was worth it - small portions, perfectly refreshing for the heat. ?It was a little hot, but I liked sitting next to the grill and watching everything come out. ?I've already decided what I want to order next time! I ordered pretty far and wide - seaweed salad (great and refreshing in the summer heat), tako wasabi (octopus in wasabi sauce that was not so good), cold ramen noodles with dipping sauce (amazing!), grilled fish, and finally grilled onigiri with a cold plum inside. ?Everything was delicious except for the tako wasabi. ?If I lived closer, you can bet I would either be here or Sunrise mart, getting a japanese food fix, all the time. If I come back the okonomiyaki will definitely be what I would like.

It was like a whole new world opened up to me when I went to Yakitori. It was noisy, crowded, unkempt, and full of energy! Although it can take anywhere from 10-40 min to get a table, its worth the wait! (And while waiting you can just walk around St. Marks place and check in every once in a while. Some days they even took my cell phone number down and called me when my table was ready). I find the food to be very good for the price paid; I recently traveled to Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka) and I would say that the food her is on par with a similarly priced restaurant over there. I recommend first timers try the Yakitori Tea since you get to choose any 5 skewers you want (some have a $0.25 surcharge, but I wouldn't worry about it breaking the bank). The Asapara Bacon (Asparagus wrapped with bacon) is one of my favorites. I always enjoy dragging my friends here who end up loving it also!!!

We stopped by Yakitori for a quick bite before a night of drinking. ?We tried a few things on skewers. ?The thing I remember the most was the chicken skin. ?It was surprisingly good.

This is a hole-in-a-wall izakaya. ? Food was solid. ?Most kushi items were great - both chicken and chicken skin were well executed. ?But the mentaiko chicken was overcooked. ?Glass noodle was good. ?Okonomi yaki was also good, though not as good as that of Otafuku. ?Beef with scallion was excellent - best version I've had in New York. ?Drinks were good. ?But be aware that when you order large, they are really large. Service was quick and efficient. ?The interior was quite small, which was actually a good thing because even though there was a bunch of loud NYU students who thought they were so cool that they dared to eat chicken hearts, it was not as loud as bigger places such as Kenka. ? All in all, this is a reliable and authentic izakaya for late-night eats and drinks. ?The crowd could be boisterous and obnoxious, but the small size of the restaurant helps.

I was recommended to go to this place by an asian friend that said it was good for snacks. ?I was told to go to this place by my favorite sushi chef. This place was great. Lots of yelling around. ?I love communication. ?I got to sit at the bar with my brother. ?The chefs were together so well. ?I wanted to try so many things they put out. We were just grabbing some apps, but the agadashi tofu was solid - great soft inside texture, a nice crisp but not crunchy crust, a nice dashi broth to compliment it all. ?I was told to go for the kawa - chicken skin. As my brother said - this is so good. Mom would kill us if she knew we were eating this. ?So crispy and flavorful. ?This breaks all the pre-conceived notions of the clean smooth taste of Japanese food. The staff was prompt in filling water and getting us our bill. ?Can you believe it? An asian restaurant where the staff actually is on top of watching your beverage levels! I will be back to try more things.

The atmosphere in this place is great. It's a far cry from your typical trendy New YOrk City Japanese restaurant. The ramen is delicious (though probably pretty unhealthy). The meat skewers are also great, and they have all kinds of Japanese liquors which you can try if you're adventurous, including a sweet potato flavored one. (The one I tried sounded very exotic but ended up tasting like vodka. Boring!!) The service was pretty terrible (I waited almost 45 minutes for my entree to arrive). But I'd still go back...I think it was a rare mistake, not something they do often.

"Why did I come here...? " I questioned the same question over and over again, sitting there. I didn't like it. Pack crowded, people get cranky trying to get a seat. ?unfriendly staffs, young chefs holding fridge door and molding onigiri.(we were sitting right in front of kitchen and able to see what's going on..) ? Someone wrote a review about best Takoyaki. Man..he must've had Takoyaki for the first time. It's such "so~so" one, if not below average. ? Yakitori Menu A was good, but that's about it. Can't believe I had to pay like $60 for squatting on a bar with elbow to elbow, yet this ain't no Paris elbow...People, don't get it wrong as if this should be the way they do it in Tokyo. Nice is nice and clean is clean. ? I'm such a lenient person trying to find good things from everything, and it ?has become my first below-3 review. Too bad. I'd never come back here. Rather go to Kenka or Go in the same row. Today's lesson: "One bad dinner can ruin your whole evening." Watch out!

LOVE! Bacon-wrapped EVERYTHING! How can you possibly go wrong? Bacon-wrapped asparagus, bacon-wrapped scallops, quail egg, chicken balls, the list goes on and on.

I've already been here twice in the past week. ?Great place to go with a few friends for some drinks, tasty food, and good times. None of the items are real culinary breakthroughs, but they're not really intended to be. ?The restaurant essentially takes Japanese street food and does it really, really well. The spicy tuna tartar is refreshing, the Japanese pancake is filling, and the fried oyster in garlic lemon butter sauce is addictively good. ?The same can be said about the deep fried shrimp in the mustard sauce, and one can have a field day ordering all of the assorted yakitori, as each range from $1.50 for something like chicken balls to $3 for something like bacon wrapped scallops. ? ? Definitely a place everyone in NY should check out.

This was my second visit to this tiny little Jap place. ?My friend and I were overall quite satisfied with the food. ?Decent dish size, yummy taste, and reasonable price. This time, we tried: 1) Grilled duck slices - one of the daily specials. ?Duck was marinated in some sort of probably BBQ sauce, juicy and tasty. 2) Grilled whole squid - I always order this dish from Jap restaurants. ?The squid was well cooked though remained bouncy. ?Dipped in the sauce, and it was yum! 3) Deep fried fish with cheese - my friend's favorite. ?Although I'm not a big fan of cheese, I ate a lot of this dish too, so you know it's good! 4) Gyoza (pan fried pork dumplings) - very thin dumpling skin! ?Well pan fried! 5) Chasyu Tonkotsu Ramen (ramen noodles with extra roasted pork in pork soup base) - noodle was amazingly good, firm to the bite, tasted like hand-made. ?But soup base was very very salty. ?Soup is the soul in Ramen, so this one seriously failed! We spent around $40 in total, and got so full that we didn't have any room for dessert. ?So it was not bad :) I remember last time we had their Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake with squid, shrimp & pork), which I liked, and the skewers were okay - if you have never had it, it's worth a try.

This place is why I love NYC. Rain, shine, night or day, you can find the craziest shit open including this place. Its small, always packed and reaks of smoke from the grills going. The food is off the chain and is a must stop if in the area... I mean, don't go here it sucks. The chicken skin skewers are ridiculously good. Clogged arteries, maybe. Tasty satisfcation, oh yeah. We ordered other stuff too but for the life of me, I can't remember anything else. Drawbacks? If you don't have the time to wait or have a pretty large group, don't bother. It can also get pricey depending on how much you order.

Where does one go for a panoply of protein? ?Why, Yakitori Taisho! ?We had walked by several different restaurants on St. Marks Place, but none had the impressive array of Taisho. ?Their menu is dizzyingly extensive. For appetizers, we started with kim chee (nice flavor, but not crunch at all!), seared tuna skewers (eh), and sauteed vegetables (very delicious!). ? My friend and I ordered the 10 skewer party platter -- 2 of each: 1) shrimp 2) beef 3) chicken teriyaki 4) chicken meatballs 5) scallions I pretty much liked all of them, but it was a bit greasy. ?The skewers are served on top of raw, crunchy cabbage. ?That makes up for the extra oil, I suppose. This entire meal cost less than $30! ?What a bargain

We went there for dinner, it was a very small place..we had ordered a bunch of yaki stuff on the menu...and i have also ordered their wasabi tako which was not bad....=) I have also tried their eel nabe and their okonomiyaki....both were ok..but their main thing was the yaki stuff...so you cant go wrong with that...

I am surprised at how many different subdivisions of Japanese cuisine there are. This is a new one for me. And I love it. Chicken on a stick dipped in teriyaki... what more do you need? This place has a lot of character: it is a subterranean wooden cave and certainly feels like one. I tried lots of stuff here... chicken on a stick, chicken skin on a stick, chicken gizzard on a stick (very odd consistency), cooked quail eggs, scallops wrapped in bacon, and more. It's easy to try new things here as you just order by the skewer. So there's not much commitment.

Ok if you're a prima donna then please leave. If you can't get a seat where you like then leave. You guys suck anyway Ok my review of this place.. is A for F*CKING AWESOME I miss the staff there especially this short haired waitress rocking the white frames. The rest of the staff is Awesomely down to earth too. They have a well knit family. Thank you Taisho for opening this place. My friends and I made it a common place where we would spend friday or saturday or even sunday nights eating and drinking after our evening rituals of hanging out or partying it up. The food is grilled so you have a great variety of healthy choices. Oniri, Skewed Chicken, Sushi, etc. I have to admit it is tight on space but guess what it's on one of the busiest streets in nyc ST MARKS!!! I've seen a number of people come in here with their POSH POSH attitudes and the only reason you're complaining is because you're spoiled and honestly just stupid. God damn these wannabe hipsters just come in and enjoy. No one named you the queen. Come in and enjoy like the rest of us. Come back down to earth and enjoy the food, the company, and the staff.

My boyfriend and I accidentally found this place when we saw the line in Ippudo was too long and decided to look for another place to eat. I'm sure glad we did! There was already groups of people outside the restaurant before the place opened. We were the last two that were able to get a seats. The place is really small and we set at the bar area. I ordered the Kim Chi Noodles and had chicken skewers. Both were really good. I was suspicious if some of the chicken was undercooked though. Not a place you would go for the service but I liked the Japanese-punk rock feel to atmosphere.

I LOVE this place. My friend MCC A. got me hooked a few years ago and every year when I visit her in NYC, this is the first place I want to eat! It has never failed me and I rave about it to my friends and family in Chicago all the time. I wish so much that they had a Chicago location. Their skewers are reasonably priced and taste amazing, plus they get to you really quick after you order, even if it is really busy, which is usually the situation. I love the Salmon rice ball, and my favorite, Unagi Tofu. The place is small, but can fit more people in the back. It's in a great area and has a lot of character. I can't think of anything critical to say about this place, it's the best! I love everything on the menu. I can't wait to go back already. I promise if you go here, you won't be disappointed! ... and I rarely make promises, especially when it comes to food. :-)

This is a true Japanese restaurant. No frills, the focus is on the food. Don't be deceived by the small front room, there are plenty of tables in the back, but where it's at is sitting at the bar watching the chefs work the grill and prepare the dishes. Menus are laminated and full of pictures and while cheesy anywhere else, I wouldn't have it any other way. This is a true authentic experience, the wait staff are all young chatting casually in Japanese throughout the night only switching to English to take your order. I spoke a little Japanese with the waiters and loved the banter back and forth, it added to the ambiance and dining experience. The chicken piece and beef meatball skewers are delicious and served over cabbage. Also the rock shrimp lightly fried with a mustard tangy sauce on top is sublime. Washed down with a pitcher of Sapporo and two bottles of cold cedar sake, I couldn't have been happier. And the place was crowded at 10 PM on a Wednesday, sign of a good time. Can't wait to go back.

I've been here twice, but both times only after a night out drinking, so I can't say if my review is fair.. but food and pricing is pretty typical of St. Marks. Japanese foods like skewers, ramen, etc. I had some tonkotsu ramen the last time I went, and it was pretty damn delicious (though keep in mind this is what I thought while under the influence.. haha) but a little too salty. Small tables and bar area in the front, and a small back room with 2-3 tables in the back. Overall, a good place for late night snacking. I think last call for food was something like 3 or 4am.

Love this place! the food is amazing. We had the kalbi with miso sauce, the kalbi was cooked so tender and juicy and marinated to perfection. the fried oyster with tartar sauce was amazing too. It arrived hot and crispy with the tartar sauce made with imitation crab meat....very yummy the kimchi pork udon was a bit on the saltier side but very good we also got the sliced tuna with butter and peanuts which was a bit salty for me all the little dishes price range from $6 to 9 dollars and their pitchers are about $14 dollars each. very reasonable for NYC i took off one stat because the place is very small and crowded and loud...and the wait for a table can be long Will definitely return again!

Grilled chicken skin, chicken meatballs, chicken with salmon roe, ramen with salmon in a cream sauce and an unagi/tofu dish. All washed down with two of my namesake beers (or am I the beer's namesake? hmmm). All in all it was a great meal, my dining companion was pleased as well and I want to go back like tomorrow for more yakitori. I think I just might. Maybe take it to go or something. Only weird moment - the bathrooms, which are tiny even for a small person like me. I was afraid I'd drop something somewhere unpleasant and that kind of detracted from the whole point of using the restroom. Still - solid 4 stars, might even be a 5 in the future once I go back and try some more deliciousness.

This place is always packed and line is out the door most nights. However, I really enjoy the vibe here and it just feels more authentic than other Yakitori places.

Been going here for years. The yakitori are a great way to go, especially with a group. The grilled squid is probably my favorite menu item. Hard to go wrong with a beer and some gyozas, too. In fact, as long as you think "beer and snacks" you'll do pretty well here. Back before ramen shops started sprouting up like mushrooms in the EV I'd sometimes get the ramen here. The tonkatsu scratches the ramen itch in a cost effective manner, but don't expect it to be the kind of sublime experience you can find at other places nearby (for twice the price). It really does feel like some places I've been in Tokyo. But this is New York, and as guy who stands over 6' tall I have a tough time maneuvering around the place. I end up feeling pretty cramped once seated, surrounded by the bustle. It's a fun environment, but not really sized right for me, which keeps me from enjoying it as much as I'd like to. Add a star if your short and don't mind crowds. (It's often packed with a line out the door...)

Remove yourself from the hustle of the concrete jungle and squeeze yourself into a little Japanese restaurant. Japanese decorations all over the walls, tight spacing with people almost on top of each other, and always the staff shouting in Japanese when you enter. Char su pork (traditionally Chinese) is tender and sweet. It comes with thin slices of avocado, which is always welcome to any dish. The takoyaki is the best I've had. Instead of being dry and bland, it actually had an enjoyable moist texture. You can't go wrong with the yakitori combos, though the more adventurous foodies should probably order by the skewer. And finally, you can get a cheap pitcher of Sapporo or Kirin with your meal. Good times.

Ordered a bunch of small things to share for our group and they were all yummy! This is a great place to come with a group of friends (probably a small group of friends since the place isn't that big!) We ordered a skewer platter, ja jiang myun (or however they spelled it, basically it's noodles w/ meat sauce), the taisho don (chicken/meatballs/eggs and kimchi over rice), plus some sort of eel roll. Man..everything was tasty! Love it...and the place looks totally authentic and like something you would find in Japan. Most things are pretty reasonably priced as well woohoo. And of course gotta love the cute little Japanese hostess/waitresses =)

This place is super good. Food is always fresh and full of flavor. Only thing I hate about this place is the seating and the wait. Always a super long wait and is usually the reason why I don't come here but when I do stop by, the seating for two is usually at the "bar" which is tight cramped seating with people constantly walking by you and brushing elbows with the people next to you. It's a good thing the food is good. Side Note: $8 minimum which isn't hard to reach.

What happens when you go here and have a bad date? At least you got a great meal (as long as you know what to order)! While this place can be a madhouse during the dinner rush, it's really part of the Japanese Yakitori experience. Traditionally these places are underground, narrow hold in the walls and with minimal counter space for eating. If you're looking for a quiet night out with a group of friends...keep on walking way, way off St. Marks! As mentioned, with the tight space, it's best to come here with one other, more than that, I'd say four should be max. With that said, onto the food! Order the: Okonomiyaki - Japanese (savory) Pancake with bonito flakes, sweet brown sauce and mayo, sounds odd but this is an all time favorite for many! Fried Chicken Skin - if you like fried chicken, give it a go, that's where all the taste is anyhow Skewers - if you like the sauce then all (or most) would be good, as the meat, veggies and grilled rice balls are based with the same sauce! Tip: I recommend sitting by the counter in the front of the restaurant; you see the action at the grill, get the attention of the staff more easily and (if you're luckily) get some eye candy at the grill (food and cook that is instead of making eye contact with your not-going-well date)

I love this place! The first time for some reason, my friend and I ordered the ramen, and we were so disappointed. But duh...order what they're known for! Yakitori! Everything is soooo good! They have benches inside but I love sitting at the bar and watch the chefs make the food. Everything is super hot and super flavorful. It seems that it's best to come here when it's super late so you don't have to wait in line. Also avoid Friday nights.

Yum! After watching my favorite DJ at the Armani Exchange in Soho (for Fashion's Night Out) a few friends and I ventured over here to get food and to quench our thirst. We ordered a few huge pitchers of beer and sake to go along with our meals. Three of us shared a platter of meat skewers and this Japanese pancake thing (okonomiyaki) made with shrimp and crab adn some other seafoods (I think). Everything was so yummy, but then again, I was starving. We had to wait a bit before we were seated, but turnover is relatively quick so it wasn't a huge bother. Plus, if you have to wait, St. Marks has plenty of kiosks and shops to keep you occupied. Seating is a bit tight, but it makes for a fun and intimate night with your friends.

I've taken many friends here and again and again I get the same response - they love it! When you walk in you truly feel like you've just walked into an authentic Izakaya in the middle of Tokyo. The food is wonderful, and as a vegetarian had plenty of options to choose from. My meat eating counterparts were in heaven and their favorites are the skewers of chicken skin, squid legs and bacon wrapped scallops. Also, try the grilled rice ball, the grilled squid, tuna carpaccio and octopus dumplings. All to die for! The service is great, they bring all the plates one by one as they are ready and are very attentive. The place is small & loud, but it's an authentic dinner experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night!

Get the skewers, get the skewers, GET THE SKEWERS!! They open around 6/7 PM. I always get the skewers when I come here. To satisfy my Asian palette, they have just what I need. BBQed gizzards, intestines, animal skins, etc. With their famous concoction of some kind of honey-sweet sauce that they put on the sticks of goodness, I finish my first plate asking for more. This is absolutely the best place to come for a hang out; but you would need to come early because a line forms even before the restaurant opens. Thinking about it now, I wish i could have one of the cute chefs that I was sitting in front of in my backyard whenever I BBQ chicken gizzards.

This place smelled delicious when we walked by, looked delicious while we waited in line, and the menu screamed delicious when we sat down. But it was ok. It could have been what we ordered. ?We got Kimchi noodles, 3 different kinds of yakitori (beef, chicken, and bacon wrapped scallops), and a salmon cream yakisoba. ?The best dish was definitely the Kimchi (blast for not remembering what kind of noodles), but probably for the novelty not so much the taste. ?The salmon cream yakisoba seemed more like an italian dish than a japanese. ?And to top it off the chicken yakitori was pink...we had to describe this to the server a few times before he understood to take it back. After the dinner me and my friend agreed that it was a unique experience but not a place we'd bring visitors too. ?Onward to the hunt for the best NY japanese joint!

I came here twice, once with my sisters and once with my BF and his family. This place is okay. I just happen to be a picky eater. There's a pretty good selection though so hopefully the next time I come here I can try more things which I'll like. The unagi rice is really good, we got more than one of those after trying it.

The wait for this place was horrible on a Friday night! Luckily, I had smart friends who knew how to kill time wisely! We waited at some sushi bar a couple of doors down and took advantage of their happy hour specials! Yay for lychee and mango martinis! They weren't strong but for $5 each, they had to water it down somehow! Don't come here if you're claustrophobic because seating is dangerously close! It was definitely cozy in there but c'mon now, it just gives you a better excuse to get closer to that special someone! Anyway, I was too distracted by the conversations around me so I just ate whatever was passed or dropped on my plate! The food was delicious either way! Company just made the experience that much more enjoyable!

The food is okay. Don't get the bacon with asparagus skewer- I'm a huge fan of bacon but even so I didn't enjoy it. I think it was too soft and for some reason too cold. I wouldn't really recommend the takoyaki or beef skewer either, but I liked the scallion and chicken skewers. Especially the scallion! The service was very attentive. There was only one menu between the two of us so it took a long time to decide what to order. The waitresses asked us literally four times if we were ready and we kept saying no. I felt kind of rushed tbh, but better that than waiting a long time I guess. The only thing is that it's really dingy and crowded. But as long as you're not expecting anything fancy it's fine. It is what it is, though I don't know if I'd come back.

The yakitori order: -chicken skin -beef -beef meatball (pretty good) -bacon wrapped scallops -shrimp The beef meatball was the best. Could have lived with the shrimp and chicken skin. The wait outside was about 20 minutes, and they tend to move pretty quickly. You are pretty much seated with everyone else, and I found it funny that other diners had to continually get up in the middle of dinner because of the lack of space between the tables. A little on the too-loud side for me.

I did some research on Yelp for Yakitori place. Since this one has a lot of good rating, I decided to give it a try. I ending up loved it :) I don't think it's a good place for more than 3 ppl. Because their dining area is really small. Most of the people are sitting at the bar in front of the chef. We were 6 of us and we are very lucky to be able to get the only table right by the door. Therefore we can chat and stuff. If not we might ending up sitting side by side which is impossible to talk to the others. I loved their Japaneses pizza. It was really good. I think all my friend who went with me loved this place. If i go back to NYC next time, I sure will go back :)

I LOVE THIS PLACE. i lived in japan for six years so i'm very finnicky about my japanese food. ?whenever i go to this place, i literally feel like i stepped through some wormhole in the space/time continuum and ended up in some little hole in the wall izakaya behind shinjuku station, replete with drunk salarymen and odd pieces of chicken on sticks. i came here with a coworker on a rainy thursday night. ?the place - as always - was packed, but we got seated pretty quickly. ?if you've been to japan and you're familiar with yakitori/izakaya food, then you'll get this place in a heartbeat. ?if you haven't, then it takes a little while to navigate the menu and figure it out. ?essentially this is like tapas - you order a bunch of little plates of stuff and share. we had agedashi dofu, a bunch of yakitori, yaki onigiri, . . . i can't remember what else. ?oh yeah - BEER. ?lots of beer. ?fresh out of the tap. my only frustrations with this place are that it's just so flippin' crowded and the poor wait staff are literally RUNNING all over trying to take care of everyone. ?it's a victim of its own success, i suppose. i come here every single time i'm in nyc and i will continue to do so. ?i love it!

I can't really add anything that hasn't already been written by the chorus of reviews here, but I will say one thing. The servers here are way too nice for working in the most cramped space imaginable. They rock. The food has been uniformly tasty to memorably great and the beers are large and cold. Come on down!

Went with a friend who is a big fan and pretty much let him do the ordering for us. The only thing I know for sure I tried was the chicken skin (sooooo good) and the chicken meatballs. Everything else was just a blur of random chicken pieces on skewers. It was all tasty, though. We also got cheesy potatoes and some kind of pumpkin tempura. Both were good. Recommend this place for a fun meal with friends.

I havent been to Japan yet, but this place definitely emanates the authentic japanese feel... All wooden stools to sit, wooden tables, wooden floor and wooden walls. Once you enter, you can see groups of japanese people guzzling pitchers of sake and japanese beers. The waitress warmly welcomed me and asked to have a seat. She handed me the menu. Thank god the menu dishes had an english description :) ? I started off with a miso soup with tofu for 4 bucks. It was a pretty plain one with some soft pieces of tofu and some green leaves. Next I tried the Yaki Unagi sushi roll, which was basically lightly grilled eel with avocado. The dish consists of 6 sushi rolls topped with some mayo. It was for a reasonable 9 bucks. Oishikatta !! (if am not wrong it means 'it was delicious'... the waitress taught me this :)) I ended with a Sapporro draft beer. The total was 17 bucks and 3 bucks tip. The food was good, good prices, cute innocent looking waitresses ;) Also this place gets overcrowded on late nites. Thank god I got a seat immediately. All-in-all, a good experience. Will come again to try the BBQ dishes. Arrigatto !!

Yakitori is a great example of function over form. ?Its cramped, dingy, and freakin' delicious. ? St. Marks is it's own little foodie mecca and Yakitori rules it Japanese style, with a samurai sword and a gloved backhand. ?I don't even like the concept of Yakitori (tiny street-food sticks) because I like to gnaw my meat off the bone whenever possible (preferably still attached to the animal, screaming), but the other items on their menu are just drool-worthy. ?Who knew fries and dipping sauce could be the object of my gastrointestinal desires? Prices go from $3 to $20, I suggest you share family style. ?Expect about $20-25 per person all said and done. ?Bring something (read: mother-in-law) to stuff under the table if it wiggles.

This place is all kinds of awesome. ?The last time I was here, I definitely went a little overboard ordering: chicken skin, fish balls, grilled garlic, squid legs, noodles and Okonomiyaki (it's like a giant ?meat pancake with just about everything but the kitchen sink thrown in and topped with Japanese mayo...and its freakin' amazing!). ?And that was for two people! ? I love St. Mark's because you never know what you're going to get: tatted up freaky-freaky's; NYU kids eating 99 cent pizza and singing karaoke; members of Local 13-whatever stumbling out of that pub on the South side of the street (you know the place I'm talking about!) or people looking for yakitori. ?I fall into the latter, because I've never met something skewered and grilled that I didn't want to eat. ? I will not rest until I've ordered every possible grillable foodstuff they've got. ?I'll probably be done around 2012.

Always a wait at this little hole in the wall, but the yakitori is sooo good! A must stop place if you're in the St. Marks area. - B Set Skewers: yummy assortment of skewers - Kimchi Udon: delicious and not too spicy, noodles are good - Bacon Wrapped Skewer: good if you like bacon - Chicken Skin Skewer: yummy even though i usually don't like the skin part It's a small place with wooden tables and chairs. Not ideal for large groups. Service is usually fast and efficient. Lots of NYU kids and be prepared to wait on weekend nights.

During a two-hour wait for ramen at another restaurant, my party decided to wonder through the east village and stop for a pre-dinner dinner at Yakitori Taisho. ? The place has a great vibe, and luckily we were seated without a wait. ?We ordered the yakitori combination platter with the typical assortment of skewers (chicken, beef, green onion, shrimp, and squid balls). ?Also odered the beef tongue and squid legs. ?This place has an interesting assorment of yakitori, but the quality is below that of Yakitori Kokko in San Mateo. What was particulary outstanding was their okonomiyaki (Osaka style) and their takoyaki. 3.5 stars.

there is a silver lining to the 2.5 hours wait at ippudo, and that silver lining is Yakitori Taisho. Luckily, we were seated immediately at the bar and able to drool over everything that came out of their kitchen. We were craving some savory, delicious japanese food, and everything we ordered hit the spot. I'd highly recommend the: - tako yaki (octopus balls) - the brown sauce that accompanies them is simply put, aewsome - kimchee yakiudon (pan-fried udon with kimchee and pork) - it's not the most spectacular plate of noodles you'll ever have but they give you a hefty serving that's really tasty and will fill you up on the cheap - yakitori skewers - I'd order a hodge podge to get a taste of everything. I LOVED the scallions. I found it interesting that it was its own "dish" since scallions are typically just a garnish. I'd definitely recommend that along with the chicken heart (for first timers - it's not as gross as it sounds!). I didn't love the chicken with salmon roe, and the bacon wrapped scallops were a bit too oily and undercrisped for my liking, but hey. It's bacon and scallops. Go for it if that's your MO. I'm excited to come back again to try more of the menu. this place is super cheap, delicious, and the service is composed of many chipper japanese folks.

Awsome lil spot on ST. Marks Place to get your fix of Yakitoris. The place feels like you're in a shack in japan. Being new to the whole concept of Yakitori (which is food on a stick) we tried an order of the bacon wrapped asparagus - they were absolutely delicious. We also had the soft shell crab - which was OK and some miso soup which was good. You cant go wrong here if you wanna grab a spicy bite after some drinks :)

Yes, its famous for its yakitori, but they have lots of other delicious Japanese dishes as well. The yakitori is made by this old Japanese guy and his minions, and dipped in this amazing sauce, and it comes to you steamy hot and juicy. ?Open late night. Always packed. There are two areas separated by a store, but serve the same menu, so keep an eye out for which one moves faster. So good.

Taisho is the definition of a 3 star rating, nothing more, nothing less. ?The large menu is executed without much passion or thought, but it never fails to satisfy a craving for cheap Japanese bar food at 2am. ?The service usually sucks, but the beer is always cold, and its certainly a great place for people watching. ?The food is very inconsistent from day to day but usually doesn't disappoint.

This review is for Oh! Taisho: i went back on tuesday and it was still good. got the eel and tofu in a cast iron skillet, ate a chicken gizzard (not a fan), chicken skin wasn't good either, but the scallop and bacon thing was really good and the quail egg was pretty good. the scallop is not a scallop though. that is for sure.

We were trying to go to Oh! Taisho, a couple doors down, but the wait was too long, so we ended up sneaking over to Yakitori Taisho, which has very similar food and no wait at all! The three of us ate for about $45 before tip, which was very reasonable, and we were stuffed. ?The spicy tuna was delicious, as well as the shiitake mushroom skewer and the grilled squid dish. ?The rice balls are HUGE, so be prepared for that if you order one for yourself! Our table was pretty tiny for three people, but quite cozy haha. ?Service was rushed but the food also came out really fast.

Cool place with a great atmosphere but between the shifty service and 10 minutes spent trying to masticate my beef skewer, I don't get the accolades. I ended up spitting the beef into my napkin, so negative points for forcing disgusting behavior. I seriously couldn't chew it and I for one would like to pride myself on my dental ?dexterity. We also got grilled sushi, rice balls and a variety of skewers and everything was halfway decent, but definitely fell short of yelp-induced expectations.

I can never get enough of this place. As authentic Japanese as you can find in New York. Go here if you want to try some decadent food and expand your flavor palette. Forget the minimalism you're used to with Sushi; this place epitomizes the adventurous, over-the-top-flavor side of Japanese cooking. The main categories of food their carry are yakitori (skewers/kebobs), ramen, bento-style boxes, and interesting protein dishes (many fried). The menu can be overwhelming, so on ?your first visit I recommend getting a bunch of yakitori that sounds appealing. Of particular note are the Chicken Meatball, Pork, and Scallion. If you're adventurous, try some of the wild combinations like Bacon-Scallop. I personally can't stomach others, like the chewey Chicken Gizzard. The ramen is just what you'd imagine. Good. The dishes are where this place really shines. You've gotta love the Seaweed Salad, Spicy Tuna Tartare, Saikora Steak, and Baba Kimchi. But for those of you willing to be risky, I recommend two dishes that never fail to impress: Mentai Potato and ... I can't spell this right... Chikwa Cheese? The Mentai Potato is some badass home-style french fries with a mayonaise & fish egg dipping sauce. Just try it. The Chikwa Cheese is deep-fried fish cakes, filled with melted cheese. Oh, and a mayo dipping sauce, too. Naturally. Anyway, you have to try this place. Go and order some ridiculous dishes and see what happens. I did mention the pitchers of Sapporo and sake bombs, right? Note: Don't confuse this place with Oh! Taisho! which is a few doors down. Same owners, very similar food, but Yakitori Taisho is a step up.

We love Yakitori, and desperately miss our many nights at the counter at Katsu's in Singapore. So, we were very excited when we found Taisho's Too bad the food was awful! The dried, burnt, tough little pieces of leather served barely passed as meat. For the first time in my life we walked away from yakitori left on my plate... It was that bad. The selection of sake was pretty limited and the cabbage snack served was: ?a) not free, unlike almost every other yakitori restaurant in Japan and around the world. b) limp and cut into small pieces, not big fresh, cold leafs. ?c) without the tasty brown sauce for which the cabbage is really just an organic spoon. We asked for the brown cabbage sauce and they brought us a small dish of soya sauce! #fail ! Is iy possible that there really is no amazing Yakitori in this city!?!

Service - very helpful with frequent checking in Okonomiyaki (japanese pancake) - zomg so good. Yakitori (meat on stix) - good, but probably not enough to name the shop after it.... Who cares? ?There's sake and giant beers. Given the flavor, freshness, and general quality of the menu at Yakitori Taisho, I consider the prices reasonable to slightly amazing. I'm so down to come back.

The wait is long and the place is small, so if you're claustrophobic don't come here. Everything is good especially the fries with the orange mayo sauce, fried squid (calamari), and the noodles with salmon which tasted like alfredo noodles. I don't eat meat, but according to my friends the chicken meatball skewers and beef tongue is delish too. The portions are tiny, so don't expect to get full off of just 2 or 3 dishes. I guess the point is you get to try everything.

Portland Oregon has a severe deficiency in the izakaya department. If you think this is untrue, you need to learn more about Japanese culture and go to a better one. For example, Yakitori Taisho. The atmosphere and the food was great, I was happy just to be here since the East Villiage is full of izakaya and ramen stops, and my strict vegetarian friend was keeping me from enjoying all of the Japanese food I would have been devouring otherwise. But anyway, this place supplied me with a good 2-3AM post-drinking izakaya fix. The kind that Portland can't ever give me. I had some skewers, which to be honest I don't remember all that well except that they tasted delicious. I also had (sorry I can't remember the exact name of the dish) some sort of unagi-rice bowl that was great too. But I could eat eel day in and day out without getting tired of it. Can I go back yet?

Came here late night after some partying in the big city around 3am. Didn't have to wait for a seat at all, there were seats right at the bar for myself and the lovely lady! I ordered the Taiko Don which was the rice bowl with 3 skewers - chicken meat, chicken balls, and beef, along with some seaweed and kimchi. Everything was amazing!! I thoroughly enjoyed my drunk munchies and would definitely come back again! minus 1 star cuz it took the waiter a while to grab me my check..

Super popular Yakitori place... I've been here many times and never really diassapointed. ? Haven't reviewed yet ?because I didn't really have anything new to say.. and I feel like EVERYONE has already been here. ?When we first moved out here, 3 of our friends separately suggested that we all go to dinner here as our first meal out on the East Coast. ?Plus, it's always super crowded. ? Anyway, we were here last Friday (Saturday morning, really) and my friend introduced us to the spicy tuna AND the spicy udon with kimchee and pork. ?YUM! ?We had also orderd the standard Yakitori Combo (Set B), but I found myself eating up the other new entrees at our table. ? Also worth mentioning is that place has an A rating. ?I'm from LA and used to looking at the health ratings. ?Now that they are finally posting them in New York, I think it's worth mentioning that Taisho got an A rating, but their neighbor down the street received a B rating. ?Go figure. ?I thought they were basically the same restaurant, but i guess not.

I really wanted to like this place. The environment is intimate. The taste to the yakitori sticks were fair. Most were over cooked. The thing that got to me was that they served all skewers together. We all know that yakitori needs to be hot. I had to stop myself from asking to warm up my yakitori after the 3rd stick.

This place rocks! It's truly a hole in the wall, with small tables but a long counter/bar. Takoyaki was absolutely good even though it was made ahead of time and just heated up in the microwave......still yummy with all the works. The okonomiyaki also known as the japanese pizza, is the larger version of takoyaki. Their yakitori was awesome and served hot on a bed of cabbage still dripping in its sauces. We ordered the grilled ribs and its was so tasty and soooo tender. If you have any anxiety about small spaces & crowds, this is probably not your venue. ?It felt like I had been time warped back to Japan and that was a fab feeling, plus the food is just downright wonderful. ?Don't be thrown off by the appearance at all because you'll be missing out!

I've only been once, but I'd rather try another place before going back here. The sake selection is very small and the yakitori isn't that great. Generally not bad, but not great. I was EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED with the kawa (chicken skin), which is usually my favorite yakitori. It should be slightly crunchy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. However, it was FAR from it. Just chewy and gross. Other yakitori was mediocre and nothing special. The ambiance is there, but the service and food is not. My non-Japanese friends loved it, but this place does not stack up to anything in Japan.

Food on a stick. What more could you want? Try less mainstream things like chicken hearts or gizzard. Yum!! Maybe comfy seating would give the place 5 stars, but then it would takeaway from the cramped, hole-in-the-wall-esque ambiance that they've built up. Catch-22, eh?

I'm visiting New York for a week and this is the first place my sister took me, since she doesn't live too far from East Village. I've heard of this place, too. My friends told me they were pretty good. My sister and I ordered skewered Chicken Skin, Chicken Meatballs, Chicken Chunks, Smelt, Beef Tongue, Green Bell Pepper, Shitake Mushrooms, and Scallions. We also ordered Miso Soup with Tofu, Fried Chicken, and Salmon Ochazuke. The general consensus was that the skewered foods we ordered should've been on the grill a bit longer. Not that they were undercooked, but both my sister and I wish they would've charred the meats a bit more. For example, the Chicken Skins was good, but if they were more charred they wouldn't have been so greasy, instead the skins would be criiiiiispy. Same thing for the Chicken Meatballs, I wish the balls had a nice crust on the outside from the wood fire grill. The beef tongues were just ok, too. They sliced the tongue pretty thick, which was a bit hard to chew. However I thought they were at least properly cooked. The Smelts were good, but not extraordinary, and again they had the problem of not charring the meat.The veggies were good, but again it's very hard to fuck up mushrooms, bell peppers, and scallions. Also, the sauce that came with the skewers was on the sweeter side, a bit too sweet for me. In terms of the other dishes. The Miso Soup with Tofu was mediocre. The Salmon Ochazuke was actually not so great at all. The salmon tasted pretty fishy and I wish it had more broth (there was a lot of rice in the bowl with not enough soup in my opinion). The fried chicken was great though. Crispy skin, tender meat, and they were HOT. Pipin' hot, which was what I wanted.

Up in NYC for a conference in Midtown, I decided to duck out of the tourist trap headquarters in the theater district and I headed down to the East Village to check out Yakitori Taisho with my coworkers. Great find, thanks to yelp, of course! The yakitori concept itself is great, sets of small skewers that can be shared allowed for all of us to try a whole variety of items. Marry that concept with a few pitchers of japanese beer and life is grand. Everything we ordered was flavorful, but the total experience was great: lots of energy in the place, loved sitting at the bar and seeing the chefs cook the skewers on the narrow grill, and the service was attentive given the crowds that started to build up. My recommendation is to go early if you can to get yourself a seat. Since my last visit to Yakitori Taisho, I've become a more strict vegetarian and I will say that the vegetarian selections there are light compared to the number of meat selections, but they are plenty tasty. Might not be enough to build up a meal, but definitely satisfying enough for a pre-dinner drink and appetizer.

This has to be one of my favorite places to eat with friends. ?It's crazy busy no matter what time you go, it's cramped as all hell, and the noise levels rival that of a Metallica concert... but once those grilled pieces of meat reach your table, the sides start rolling in, and beer gets flowing... you'll never want to leave. I would say that the chicken livers or the bacon wrapped asparagus are the choice things on the menu, but then I would be a liar, because everything they make is choice. ?From quail eggs to charred scallion, they grill it all to the point where the term "yakitori" will become part of your normal vocabulary. ?But may I recommend that you don't stop at the grilled meats on a stick... you must try their french fries with cod mayo or their selection of Onigiri. If you want the perfect taste of what Japanese street fair food is like, then wait in line (because you will wait) and be ready to eat... I promise that you will walk away with a big old grin on your face and a satisfaction in your belly.

I've been here a couple of times, and while the place has a cool izakaya vibe, I can't say the yakitori was anything special. ?From a food perspective there is far better yakitori uptown (e.g. Tori Shin, Totto), to say nothing of the quality of yakitori in Japan. ?This is pretty cheap though, so maybe it's not right to expect great food - but the downside of it being cheap is that there are a thousand students waiting for each available seat. ? I'd gladly go again if I was in the neighborhood and there was no line (unlikely), but wouldn't seek it out.

Food for drunks. tiny place, friendly people, and fun times... however I came here sober and the food b-b-b-b-blows! grilled quail egg - tasted like it had been left out, really chewy and gross chicken skin - it was almost raw, not crispy at all!!! gross! squid - This was the only one I could eat, but it was super chewy. also gross! an eggplant special, deep fried half eggplant with split pea sauce and some cheesy dressing. These guys love pouring the cheesy dressing on everything. Fresh tuna - throw some cheese on it! Avocado salad? Throw that cheese on it! Cheesy dressing is tasty, but made me wish I was blotto. Ramen - I do love a good bowl of ramen. Your ramen? Not great. The noodles were blah, the ingredients just thrown together like a 3am after party. Not an ounce of love, everythings a little wilted and just looking to get eaten. If your drunk and hanging out, maybe. But not the best yakitori around.

This is a place I have to visit every time I go to NYC! The food is amazing and the prices are even crazier! It reminds me of when I went to japan. Little sticks of meat grilled to perfection... or veggies...or seafood...or wrapped in bacon... who doesnt like bacon!! If you like soft shell crab, I highly recommend it... and the ramen is great as well, especially on a cold day. However be prepared for a wait, as there is limited seating, and with the food and service so good...no one wants to leave!

I'm a frequent traveler of New York. ?I'm there 1-3 times a year to eat and shop but this last trip I discovered Yakitori Taisho and boy, oh boy did I wish I knew about this place earlier!! A friend that lives locally recommended this place for dinner. ?We met up there on a Friday night and surprisingly only had to wait about 5 minutes.. when we left, there was a longggg wait out the door, go figure!! They have a variety of snacks, appetizers, entrees, you name it... even a decent drink/beer selection. ? It's a tiny little place that goes pretty far in, but it's super cozy and very Japanese. ?People have said in the reviews that it's a shack and small, etc. but what do you expect? ?It's New York, of course the restaurant space is going to be cramped and it's more than authentic, almost as if you took a quick trip to Japan. The food was absolutely delish!! We ordered about 4 different dishes to share, one of the being the Yakitori combination which I suggest you try. ?There were so many things to choose from and so many things that I had wanted to order it was hard to narrow it down. I'd go back hands down. ?Recommended to anyone in the area visiting or looking for a good eat. ? Oh yes, and there is another one about 2 doors down, the sister restaurant or expansion of Yakitori Taisho, still as packed! :)

I arrived at Yakitori Taisho for the first time with 3 friends who decided to visit New York for spring break from Chicago. In hindsight, I would rather have picked a different spot to take them to - we were cramped into a table where there was really poor lighting, which would not have been inconvenient if we had been at least able to read our menus. Because it was all our first time trying yakitori, we asked our waitress to help us out and recommend items for us but she was very vague and seemed very uninterested in helping us out... We ended up getting the skewer combinations, and some were good and some were alright. The chicken skin skewer was very interesting and a fun try, but I preferred the other more normal skewers. We also ordered some rice balls and although they were good, they were very rice heavy. All in all, a 3-star experience.

Taisho's cramped, tiny, hole in the wall restarant space always packed. ?The place has a ton of Japanese street flare and the smoke stains to match the history of this place. ?Only open for dinner (starts 6pm) the place has a line wrapped around the block within the first 15 minutes of service (get there early!) ?The yakitori (grilled skewers) menu is pretty extensive - offering anything from every day favs beef, chicken, shrimp to the more adventurous chicken skin, quail eggs and gizzards. All orders are made to order so they arrive hot on a bed of light soy sauce and freshly chopped cabbage. Most dishes are small appetizier portions allowing you to try a variety of dishes without breaking the bank. ?Must try: Chikuwa cheese (Fried fishcake & cheese served with light japanese mayo), Agedashi tofu (Deep fried tofu with light soy), Ika Yaki (Grilled squid), Yako Taki (Grilled octopus balls), Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake with squid, shrimp & pork w/ mayo & okonomiyaki sauce) and of course don't forget about the yakitori!

I have been here on each of my visits to NY. It is very unfortunate for me to admit that the quality of their skewers is NOT as great as I first determined it to be. I may or may not find myself back at this particularly SMALL joint should I return to this wonderful city, but I would consider. Their menu is large, the prices cannot be argued against and they are open late. Never would I discover an inexpensive yakitori house like Taisho in San Francisco.

I've been here three times, loved it. Unfortuanely, the last visit crushed my soul. 1st visit: We had to wait almost an hour to be seated. Once inside, it was great. I had a fun time, enjoyed the atmosphere, thought the food was excellent. (got the Taisho Don). 2nd visit: ?I was smart and got there at 6pm when they opened, got a seat right away. Within 5 minutes the place was completely packed. Food was yummy (yakitori tei entree), i enjoyed it (can't say the same for my date, bad choice there). I recently went for my birthday, i was craving this place for months. I ordered the entree again. Meatballs had a weird texture. All of my chicken was undercooked, as well as my beef. I was so upset. I loved this place so much and the fact that they've become "lazy" so to speak with the quality of the food they're putting out is unnerving. I know the cooks are very busy and need to do things fast, but come onnn. I didn't enjoy my food at all, and was nervous the whole night about having salmonella.

This place is a gem of it's own. One of the best izakayas in NYC without spending the money for one of the best places in NYC. Located in the heart of the east village and to the home of many Japanese Izakayas and Restaurants, Yakitori Taisho seem to make a name for themselves with the food, drinks, service that they have and still provide to their loyal and new customers. They've also created their 2nd location (Oh! Taisho) about 3-4 years ago just 2 doors away from the original location. The atmosphere in the place is like being at an izakaya in japan. Small, crowded, loud with people chatting away. The music that they play here seems to change often anywhere from Jazz to Punk, Hiphop, or even Salsa! I remember waiting for over an hour and a half to get a seating back in the day (6-7 years ago) before they made their 2nd location. If you're willing to wait for the delicious food of Yakitori Taisho, they can take your name and phone number and you could go stroll around east village, hit some bars for a quick drink and when they're ready, they will call you! That's always nice. On to the food, the food seem to be a 70% hit, 30% miss for me. Most of the time it's great and no problem, but sometimes hit the miss on certain dishes, mostly on the yakitori. Sometimes they seem to overcook it to a point where some of the yakitoris are just a little too burnt. Still tasty. I have certain dishes I order here most of the time when I'm out with my friends. I usually get one of their yakitori sets (A or B) consisting of Chicken Gizzards, Skin, scallions, pork, beef and several others I might've missed. I absolutely love their Saikoro Steak (Marinated Steak) with scallions. If you love eating Steak with Rice like I do, you will fall in love with this. I personally love to order the Japanese Potato Salad (minus the tonkatsu sauce on top), jyako salad (sardine salad), french fries with the spicy cod-roe (Mentaiko) sauce, kimchi yakiudon (Kimchi Stirfried Udon), Yaki Onigiri (Grilled Rice Balls). If you're there by yourself, you order their Taisho-Don (Consists of 3 Yakitoris over rice with Kimchee and egg noodles with the pickled daikon called Takuwan) for $8, which could satisfy any one with the Yakitori Taisho goodness. They recently added a new item to their menu "Motsuni", Japanese tripe soup. This is one of my favorite dishes (Motsunabe). Give this a shot!

I would have given it 3.5 stars if I could.

Very tight place, would have given 4 stars if more comfortable. ?The table they gave us for 3 could only fit 2 comfortably. ?3 was super tight.

If you like yakisoba and grilled meats, then this is a place you should consider checking out. Located on the north side of st. Marks place, closer to 3rd Ave., this Japanese joint is usually bustling with young student types looking to get a filling meal at a decent price. This place is usually packed during the evening and night time hours, and when it is packed you may find it a little uncomfortable as the restaurant is narrow. ?However, the quick arriving food, assortment of Japanese beers, and the fun/noisy atmosphere make up for it. Yakitori is not the cleanest of places, but then again I feel a place like this shouldn't be for some reason. If you're looking for a chill place to experience a jovial atmosphere with your friends while drinking Japanese beer and experiencing Japanese pan-fried noodles and grilled foods, this is a place to check out. Just don't come with too many friends because you might not be able to find a place to sit.

I would give Yakitori Taisho higher rating because this place is ACTUALLY good fun with a group of friends. Especially when you want to get drunk and munch on BBQ seafood and yakitori-what-not. but every time I eat here, without fail, except when I am drunk and dont notice or care what I am eating -- the BBQ sticks are always undercooked. the guys in the front rush their cooking to meet the demand of the customers and so dont BBQ the food properly ?A- I mean chicken livers and gizzards and beef tongues and bacon wrapped scallops are delicious on sticks but when undercooked and all bloody and chewy (not in a good way) -- that's just gross.

OH MY GOD! That's all I can say about this place. Everything else has already been written, but my favorite time here was when I dined here solo on the night of a Superbowl after having on previous occasions having to wait in moderately long lines. This time though, the ?place was totally dead (except for the cooking action behind the bar!). I walked right in by myself at 8 P.M. and I think that if I had had a few friends with me, we still would have walked right in, that's how dead it was. Enough of the BS though. You all know it's tough enough to get in here on a regular night at 8 and the only reason I did so this easily is because it was Stupidbowl and it was also about 10 degrees out! Now on to the food: Here's the rundown: Kawa: I was expecting the chicken skin to be crispier, but it was great, nonetheless. Very tasty. I've since ordered it "well done" and it came out still nice and fatty, yet good and crispy. Tsukune: these are the suckers that I keep on tasting. They are great! I'd get at least a couple of them upon coming here next. Takoyaki: not quite as good as Otafuku: http://www.yelp.com/biz/… on the other side of the block, but they held their own, admirably ?up against the Otofuku masters. Mentai Potato: as all have mentioned - the ultimate French Fry experience. Incredible dipping sauce (I got an extra bowl). Grilled Bonito Rice Ball: I expected this to be a lot better than it was based on other Yelpers' descriptions, but it was still pretty darned good. Just not a "literal orgasm" as Lucy B. described, LOL! Chikuwa Cheese: It was my savory, (I lack a sweet tooth) dessert and it was nothing less than great! It came with tasty Japanese mayo for dipping, but I had leftover Spicy Cod Roe Mayo from the fries in which to dip it so it was extra good that way. That Superbowl night, I sat at the bar, but also was near the door so I didn't roast like others have described their bar experiences. I can really see though, that if it was hot out and you were sitting at the bar, you may become pretty heated up. The bill was $50 just for me after tax & tip, but I also ordered a pitcher of Sapporo and a bottle of Korean Jinro which made up for about 1/2 of the bill. I could only drink about 1/2 the beer so I shared with the cooks, which with a toast in my direction, they let me know they greatly appreciated. Have since come back many times solo and also with with friends - even Japanese friends! They all love it as much as I do and as will you too.

Glad I came here to try the yakitori. They really specialize in the skewers, and have delicious ramen as well. I've tried the yakitori combinations and shoyu ramen. Both were just as I hoped for. Food was made well, came out quickly, servers were friendly, and though it looks a bit intimidating from the outside (whenever I've been here it was always super crowded), but the wait time for seating is not too horrific at all.

Delicious. ? I can't believe my luck finding this place open and bustling at 2am. Legit little place and hoppin' in the middle of the night. Try the spicy tuna - just a pile of incredibly tasty, very spicy tuna. And the chicken balls, delicious. We also had the bacon wrapped asparagus, which was a little much. Great place. ?I will be back very soon.

This place is reminiscent of Shomben Yokocho in Shinjuku, Japan. ?It's rustic, in your face cooking, and the food is good! ? I love getting the Sunazuri (chicken gizzard), ?kawa ( chicken skin), kimo (chicken liver), bara (pork) x2, corn, Takana Tonkotsu Ramen, Sake Onigiri (Salmon), Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake with squid, shrimp & pork), Chikuwa Cheese (deep fried fishcake with cheese) - LOVE THIS!!! ?The draft pitchers of Kirin are good to share for two or more! ? My experience with the wait time is an average 40-50 minutes on Fridays and Saturdays after 7pm. ?It should be expected.

This place borders on 3.5 to 4 for me. The menu items are quite diverse from yakitori to ramen to kaarage and the list goes on. We ordered the seaweed salad, kawa (chicken skin), quail eggs, beef tongue, bacon wrapped asparagus, tori kaarage, agedashi tofu, fried fishcake stuffed with mozzarella, takoyaki and okonomiyaki. All this plus a pitcher of sapporo came out to be ~$50 before tip. Not bad at all. The food in general was good but the okonomiyaki was too thick and had a lot of random things in there including bacon, shrimp, potatoes, cabbage and many others. The thickness of it made it mushy and took away the crunchy texture you would otherwise get when done right. Taste wise, it was very similar to the takoyaki so just get one or the other, not both. The taste of the fried fishcake stuffed with mozzarella cheese was quite complex, fusion like. It did not taste traditional but grew on me as I ate a few more pieces. Imagine a fried mozzarella stick except breaded with delicious fishcake. If you come here you should definitely try their yakitori. The quail eggs & beef tongue were delicious. Eating them in this environment (filled with loud drunken people crowded together) adds to the experience, similar to what you would find in japan. itadakemasu!

I think a cramped, hole-in-the-wall place like this is the best place to be in a cold, foot-high snowy day. ? Sake hot or cold depending on the weather. ?Mentai potato with spicy cod roe mayo... mmmm I could eat that all day, get fat, get triple heart bypass, rinse repeat... then die. ?Good thing I don't live right above. ?

Very ?salty food and very small table/personal spaces BUT cheap. The chicken skin was thick and chewy which Im not used to so I couldnt eat it haha It should be crispy or battered and crunchy!!! Thats how I like my chicken skin damnit! Oh well. While waiting in line you can observe that all the meat skewers are dipped in the same pot of salty sauce. So for the sodium conscious, only have sauce on the side? Some non-skewer dishes also have this sauce ladled on so beware hahaha It all probly isnt so bad if you drink more tho.

During my buz trip to NY, I really wanted to have good yakitori since there is virtually none in Chicago. ?After digesting that day's tough schedule, my friend and I went there late at night to catch up on our lives over good casual food. ?Geez, it was really bad. We ordered beer, negitoro, potato salad and several yakitori. ?Kawa was not crispy at all, it felt like boiled skin. ?There was no negima (I couldn't find it). ?Tsukune was horrible - they ground meet too much, there was no signs of texture at all, it was more like... cheap fishball. Gyutan (beef tongue) and kimo (chicken liver) were edible, still below average. ?Heart was good. ?My friend and I left in less than 30 min, leaving most of food. ? Since it is a cheap place, my expectation was not high at all. ?However, the sauce they use for yakitori really needs improvement. ?I should've gone to Yakitori Totto, but it was far from my friend's place. ?Next time, I'll just pay a few more bucks for cab to have decent yakitori!

Ive yet to check out Oh! Taisho yet (right down the street), so my review may be biased for the time being, but all in all I was generally impressed with Yakitori Taisho. I played it safe and got Gyoza for an appetizer then got some Tsukune (chicken meatball), Beef, Peaman (Green Pepper), and Ebi (Shrimp) skewers. They were all pretty damn good but the Tsukune were phenomenal. I will most definitely get the Tsukune again when I come here. Ill be a bit braver next time as well and order something I havent had before. But definitely recommend this place if youre looking for Yakitori. As with most of the NYC izayakas, it is small and cramped, but thats what gives it its original flavor, wouldnt have it any other way. Ill be looking forward to trying to get to OH! Taisho in the next few weeks and compare the two!

Very fun place to eat, crowded but so NYC. The skewers are great, and they have a wide variety ranging from chicken skin to cow tongue. Other dishes we tried were the Rock Shrimp, and this egg/rice dish. Both were okay, but if I were to go again, I'd probably just get a couple platefuls of all the different kinds of skewers and I'll be good :)

i've never been a fan of yakitori, and i know that's seattle's fault. we just don't have good yakitori here! ?so i decided to give it another chance and i don't know if i did myself a favor, or if i should've stayed ignorant. now all i do is crave it... i think i can't give it 5 stars because the gizzards just lacked...everything. ?OTHERWISE, everything else was absolutely amazing. ?the chicken skins are crunchy and then melt in your mouth afterwards. ?I was in NYC almost a month ago and i still dream about the chicken skins. ?the chicken, meatballs, and beef were all delicious. we got some type of seasonal soup - i think the menu said it was their mini version of hotpot and the broth was phenomenal. i've never had anything like it. being a visitor, there are sooo many restaurants i want to try, but when i go back i'll definitely return here.

Upon revisit I noticed that I was mistaken. It happens every blue moon. The sign does not have an exclamation mark. There is a neighboring restaurant, Oh! Taisho that does have an exclamation mark. I don't like them as much so my subconcious must've subplanted the exclamation to Yakitori Taisho.

3.5 (Only discussing the yakitori!) Sis and I slipped in here around 6:30pm, got seated in a jiffy, and received our food very quickly! As others have commented, the space is limited, but it adds to the charm and "authentic" feel and reminds me of small crowded restaurants in Tokyo; we were sitting elbow-to-elbow at the counter where we could watch the chefs at work which was super neat. We got a combo with 2 skewers each of beef, chicken, chicken gizzard, chicken meatballs, and ox tongue. They were out of the chicken skin :( which is supposed to be amazing. My favorite was the chicken gizzard! -- then again, I'm not at all ruffled by eating "unusual" anatomical parts and greatly enjoyed the slight crunchy/chewiness; not for everyone though. The beef was my second favorite; it was tender and I loved the slight char. However, the chicken meatballs were only so-so, the chicken was a bit chewy, and the ox tongue was on the salty side. All of the skewers were served on a bed of cabbage, and the sauces would drain in to the cabbage and flavor it, so I would eat some of the cool, crispy cabbage in between skewers for some relief from the bbq-ed meat and the combination was great!

When I want to kick back with some delicious Japanese food and satisfy my craving for either Sapporo, Asahi or Kirin beer... I definitely go here. ?The food is not expensive and it's very good. ?I usually get set B, gyoza, the pancake dish (forgot the actual name) and the kimchi noodles to share with one other person. ?It's certainly more than enough, and I think I usually end up spending less than 20 bucks, as long as I don't go overboard with the drinking, haha. This place gets seriously busy at night, esp Friday-Saturday nights...as I've waited for up to 30 minutes for a table. ?Everyone who works at Taisho is extremely efficient, so the wait never really bothers me. ?I usually like going here with a huge group of people too... it's fun to get shoved into the small spaces with the wooden tables. ? When I go alone, I don't mind sitting at the bar and it's a bit strange feeling the heat from the cooks' grills... I almost touched it once and freaked out at how excruciatingly hot it was. Sometimes I enjoy the random music they play at this place... I've gone on a few occasions where the music was hip-hop/rap or Mariah Carey. HAHA. I love it nonetheless.... this is probably one of my favorite NYC restaurants... totally recommend for a Japanese foodie lover.

Went here a few times and got to say that the food has always been pretty good. Despite my first time ordering the fried kimchee noodles dish, which didn't end up being all that great, the Chicken yakitori skewers made up for that. Can I get a "HELL YEAH"? Oh yeah, and let's not forget about the fries with cod roe mayo sauce. Obviously that's been talked about but holy crap. I don't usually like mayo based sauces but this one is delicious. Reminds me of other creamy based sauces like the one used for spicy tuna rolls or chipotle mayo. Anyhow, please do yourself a favor and order that if nothing else. Although this place is typically crazily crowded, as in literally standing against the wall, waiting for seating, I think it's pretty worth it. They have an extensive and delicious sounding menu and the total hecticness just feeds into the overall energy of the place. And even though there's seating in the back, I recommend sitting up at the bar, where you can watch the cooks do their thing. You may be cramped and ?yes, the cooks might stare back at you but who cares, they're all pretty cute.

Yakitori Taisho and Oh Taisho are pretty much the same restaurant so I'll speak for both. A place we always take friends and out of towners b/c of it's uniqueness and authentic Japanese food. I always order chicken skin EXTRA CRISPY, saikoro steak, bacon/scallop, scallion, rice ball w/plum, and calpico... and in multiples. Chicken skin cooked the regular way tastes gross but if you have them cook it extra crispy, I guarantee you'll think it's the best skewer on the planet. Saikoro steak is a mouthwatering delicious appetizer. Cooked medium rare to medium and they marinate it well. Very few are fans of steamed rice ball with plum. Most prefer rice ball with salmon and grilled. They'll mix calpico with any alcohol on the menu, upon request. Minus one star for seating. If you have a party of 8 and 2 are still parking, they will not seat the 6 waiting there. You would have to wait till ALL arrive. But believe me, the food and service alone are worth the wait! It's very underground Japan style with uncomfortable crowded seating. Either jackets above your head, someone bumping into you every 5 minutes, or air blowing on you. It hasn't stopped us yet as we're regulars.

Had a good time at this place last night (a Saturday). ?We went because we had heard it was a good place for sake bombing, which they actually don't allow, but you can get pitchers of beer and sake and just throw the sake into your beer-- yeah, gross, but effective. After getting over the initial state of wonder at the way they somehow were able to include EVERY part of every animal you can think of on this menu -- pork cartiledge, i kid you not-- we eliminated a number of possibilities from the dauntingly long menu and made our choices. ultimately, we were happy with what we had. i was with a group, so we ordered things to share, and the meat on skewers leant itself to this particularly well. there was also good sushi with eel. it's a fun environment, with a good amount of chaos and noise, and a crowded liveliness that made it more enjoyable in my opinion. go with people who you know well and who are easygoing enough not to mind waiting a while before you get a table.

Allow me to preface by saying this was my first time having Yakitori, so excuse me while I proceed to butcher Japanese culture that is not ramen or sushi. I'm drunk and wandering the streets of New York after a failed attempt of getting a table at Angel's Share a block over. My friend recommends Yakitori... meat on a stick? How could that not be good. We ordered the set list that is the most normal sounding, with different cuts of chicken, some scallion, balls of meat perhaps. It was delicious!! We sat at the bar and I could feel the heat coming off the stove/grill as I watched the chef throw things on to cook. The food was a little salty, but it did have grains of sea salt visible, and I did douse everything in soy sauce, so I guess I can't complain. ?It was a little difficult getting the meat off the skewers without throwing pieces of chicken around the room. ?But eventually I think I settled for eating directly off the stick. ?Also, who doesn't love loud groups of drunk Asians in the corner? ?What a cute little place.

For specializing in yakitori, they could do better. The skewers Taisho serves do not even compare to those I've tried from the Chinese Xinjiang carts in Flushing in terms of tenderness and flavor. And oddly, I've even had better chicken yakitori in Florida from a regular sushi establishment. I think the problem is that they don't take the time to brush the skewers down several times with the sauce. So they seemed a little bland and watery. The chicken meat wasn't the thigh part and consequently, was dry. The beef meat was tough and dry too. The meatballs were good, the vegetables ok too. The shrimp, crispy but tasteless. We tried takoyaki, octopus balls, which were good. They had a soft, chewy texture. The okonomiyaki, or Japanese pancake, was too sweet, too much okonomi sauce, so it threw off the balance. We also had the seaweed salad which was decent. As far as the ambience goes, everything is cramped with uncomfortable little stools. Part of the ceiling in the back was covered in a black plastic bag. The place could use a complete makeover, still keeping it rustic, but with newer and better decor. Overall, the food is decent for the price you are paying and the alcohol selection is great.

Felt and tasted just like Asian barbecue! I love the street food feel and the street food price at a cute little sit-down grill. The meats are very tender and flavorful and rice is even served with Kim Chi and all sorts of side-dish-like things. They even have all the Asian delicacies like liver, heart, etc (though I would never order them). They really cater to both eastern and western tastes. They even speak in Japanese the entire time to create that authentic atmosphere. Love it and definitely will be going back again with friends.

This used to be one of my favorite japanese restaurants in the city, but when I came back here last night, I felt like their food wasn't as good anymore. We ordered the gizzard and negi skewers, spicy ramen, roast pork congee, pancake with seafood, and the raw tuna and egg rice bowl. The skewers were still good. The ramen, congee and pancake all weren't hot enough. It seemed as if these dishes never came to a full boil or they were just lightly microwaved them and then served it. I ended up packing the ramen and pancake to-go later on hoping to heat it up some more when it get home. I didn't finish the tuna bowl either because the tuna didn't seem fresh and it had a bitter after taste. I was pretty disappointed; I won't be back here for awhile...

How have I never written a review for this place? Probably because I don't want to tell people about it and make the wait even longer than it already is. Just like izakayas in Japan. Love grapefruit sake/chuhi -- just be careful, tastes like juice and you never know when it hits you! And how can you not love food on a stick! I strangely loooove the Yaki-negi! I have only had one bad dish here -- some green dumpling with cheese in it. But one out of the umpteen times I've been here is not bad at all. I have turned all my friends into addicts.

Authentic and delicious food. As it is called Yakitori Taisho, you definitely have to try the yakitori. They also have nice okonomiyaki as well. Though for hungry students, this place will cost you a lot to fill you up, as it is an izakaya, not a restaurant P.S. Ohtaisho and Yakitori Taisho are probably the brother restaurants with the same menu, but you will find more room at Ohtaisho

Yakitori Taisho is amazing this was one my first taste of real food moving from a small town in the midwest. Everything here is great, the people, the enviroment, the everything. If your a tourist this is definitive new yorker / east village experiance japanese style. The food. I consider this place one of the best because everything is moderately priced. You could try everything on the menu i bet for under $200 with a drink or two. Just try everything, anything. It opens your palate up to the japanese food culture quick. Now you can go to almost any japanese resturant and have some sort of idea of what's going on with the menu. Groups. Best place for groups. Pitchers of beer and tokkuris of sake. Large plates of food and cheap prices. Open late! No need to say more. Wait time. Worth the wait. Enjoy it.

holy yakitori!! ?this place rocks man.. ?its extremely close quarters but it almost feels like you're in some small restaurant in japan. all the cooks look like characters out of some anime series and there was this funky techno japanese music playin in the background. We sat at the bar which is kind of cool b/c you get to see them cooking the food. It tends to get kinda hot in that area though. On to the food.. ? The Fried Fish Cakes with Cheese were superb.. ?perfect texture with a creamy cheese filling. The chicken meatball, chicken wing, and chicken skin yakitori were wolfed down immediately. The bacon wrapped yakitori were very chewy though b/c the bacon was extremely thick and fatty. Agedashi Tofu with Eel Spicy Sauce : ?Wow.. ?great texture and spiciness.. ?I will be back for this. Fries with Spicy Cod Roe Mayo : Very good.. they kept on getting better as I ate the fries and dipped it into the sauce. All in all a great place to go for some great japanese food.. the environment will make you feel a little japanese too. =) Food : 10/10 Service : 7/10 Ambience : 7/10 Update : I don't think they make ANYTHING poorly here.. ?came back here, ordered some different shit, had mini orgasms again with everything, and praised the Yakitori Taisho god upon leaving.

Just a 3 I would rather go to Kenka Seating is horrible here. ?When i was younger i could take it, now i can't. Too small, too cramped. ?Their food selection is good here, i enjoyed their carpaccios and good variety of yakitoris...makes sense? But i can't come back here since typhoon and kenka are right in the neighborhood. ?And then you got good ramen two blocks away and can't forget about angel share.

so, i think that i've been here at least 20x and it remains one of my top 5 favourite restaurants in the city. ?yes, the wait is long, but they take your number so you can ogle the cool body jewelry and weird tattoo designs at the stores nearby while you wait. ?when i first started coming here, "religious sex" was still open next door (it's now the much less interesting klong thai restaurant). i come here because it makes me happy. ?the food is cheap, fast, and really really good. ?it has sort of a mom-used-to-make feel to it - that is, if my mother were japanese and able to cook. ? what i love: 1) the yakitori (which costs a few bucks each). ?they're perfectly grilled in the front of the restaurant - and if you're seated at the bar, you watch them make your food. ?the chicken meatballs are awesome - plump, succulent, juicy, and instantly addictive. ?i also really enjoy the bacon-wrapped scallop yakitori - because, let's face it, what's not to love? ?the beef yakitori is more on the chewy side, but brushed with teriyaki-sauce, is pretty flavourful nonetheless. ? 2) the okonomiyaki (cabbage pancake topped with seafood & wavy bonito flakes) is hot, starchy, and very comforting in its fillingness (i guess that's not a word). 3) various fried foods - especially the mentai potato (fries) with spicy cod roe dipping sauce. ?the potato wedges are freshly fried and piping hot, and the dipping sauce is salty, creamy, and just slightly spicy. ?so good! ?the chikuwa cheese (battered fried fishcake filled with cheese) is also another of those "what's not to love?" dishes. ?their fried chicken is salty and satisfying without being cloyingly greasy. ?fried oysters are also crispy & plump. ?however, it's the fries that i truly love! 4) sake chasuke (or however you spell it) - rice in broth with salmon. ?hot and not fishy, it's awesome on a cold winter night. ?the one with plum is a little too salty. 5) grilled rice balls - this is one of those things that i order every time i come here, and then kind of regret it - and then order it again the next time. ?the rice balls are huge (easily the size of my fist) and there is definitely too much rice and too little filling. ?however, the crispy, slightly-burnt, soy sauce brushed crispy rice outer layer makes me want to eat it every time. service is not the best, but they are very efficient. ?i've never had to wait for someone to take my order, but i do have to remind them to refill my tea. ?but whatever. ?i even like the busyness, loudness, and crowdedness of the place. ?brightly-lit, you can almost see it emanating warmth and life in the dreary winter (ok, i am exaggerating a tiny bit here, but hopefully you get what i'm trying to say). ?i'm looking forward to coming here again and again.

When you enter the place, you realize you are in a long dirty corridor of authentic unpretentious Japanese experience. This tiny place is packed with Asian people who came for good food and drinks at low prices. I've tried some yakitori and a few other dishes and they were quite good; I haven't tried the sushi (it's not really a sushi place). I'll take one star of for very slow service (you literally have to flag waitresses down to help you).

whats with the hype?? yes, its owned by japanese. yes, the workers are japanese. yes, authenticity is awesome. ...but...yeah...NO to the food! ugh. i dont even know where to begin... after 4 hours of driving from Boston, my friend and i were so ready to eat some AWESOME food! on yelp we saw that this place at 500+ people's reviews, averaging 4 stars...so i thought, HEY, must be EFFING delicious! it was 1AM, we were tired but super stoked to eat good food...only to run into this: 1. duck thing they had on the "special" menu which OUR WAITER SUGGESTED US TO TRY was flavorless. seriously. all i tasted was the oily covering on it...bleh. 2. the ramen (ultimate late night snack!) was mediocre. but i wont be too harsh on this one since it IS a yakitori place, not ramen. (though the yakitori restaurant i work at in LA has awesome ramen AND awesome yakitori...) 3. the skewers...oh, the skewers... -chicken skin was ROCK hard. i swear. my friend had a HAAARRRD time trying to even CHEW it off. it was like they cooked the stupid skin SO long that the sauce caramelized and made it rock hard! -the gizzard was ok. but i prefer salt base, not sauce dipped. so this was ok. (keep in mind, it wasnt even GOOD). -pork belly was super thin, AND had been overcooked. they werent even nice enough to scrape off the burnt edges as they should as a yakitori restaurant. -the chicken thigh with the roe was OKAY. it was one of the better options of the crappy late night munching... -beef tongue was ok...but slightly overcooked, and was tough to eat the sad part is, the best part on that plate was the cabbage...seriously. oh, the cabbage! it was super fresh and SO good...(it really was haha). -.- oh and we had grilled riceball, which was good........but how can you mess that up? however, wish they grilled a little bit more for the crispy-ness. and they ran out of tempura ice cream, which i wanted my spanish friend to try because its so american :( wtf...how do you "run" out...??? LOL. scoop of ice cream, dip it into tempura batter, done. i personally think they were just too busy and the waitress was told to cancel the order. (or they were too lazy to do so). ohhhh the disappointment. also while im at it: let me mention that the bathroom was GROSS! for a japanese restaurant, im HIGHLY disappointed :( im japanese, and i like the fact most japanese restaurants (no matter location) is usually sparkly clean...yeah this one...NO.

... New York, only the strong survive out here... this place is located in a really hectic area, so you gotta get your priorities straight ive been to NY 5 times in my life and with each time the good times keep on rollin... once again, we ordered almost everything off the menu, due to our large group... they even have these specials written on paper, plastered on the walls in random spots... the one that caught our eye was the dried sting ray... it was really good and always nice to try something new... it is a simple place with great prices... it is a bit cramped in there, but it really reminds me of being in japan, the hustle and bustle, the fact that you walk out of this place smelling like yakitori (i dont consider a bad thing unless you are planing to go out later, but hey, youre in NY, fuck it...) its a fun stop... it seems this place gets busy, but our wait for 9 people was only 30 min.. so give yourself some time... ...yakitori taisho was one of the reasons why my trip to NY was a blast... great food, great friends, great prices, and a "keepin it real" mentality put this as a must stop every time i come back... ...BANZAI!!!

I've been to Yakitori Taisho several times already, and it seems I am less impressed by the food with each visit. ?I went there again last night with my little sister. ?I had considered taking her to another restaurant at St. Mark's Place since, out of all the Japanese restaurants there, I've only been to Yakitori Taisho, and I wanted to try another place. ?But she is visiting NYC and I did not want to risk taking her to a restaurant that I am unsure about, in case the food turns out to be bad. ?We arrived at the restaurant at about 6:30 pm, and it was already crowded, but there wasn't yet a line. ?We lucked out because two people sitting at the bar had just left when we arrived, and we were seated right away. ?Sitting at a table was probably better, but all the tables were full at the time. Looking at their colourful and picture-filled menu, I am never sure what to order aside from a plate of their skewered meat. ?But for the skewers, we ordered Set A, which consists of two skewers of each of the following: ?chicken, chicken skin, chicken gizzard, chicken meat ball, and pork. ?It probably took us another ten minutes to pick other dishes, but I finally decided to order the Unatama Don and my sister chose the Nasubara. Though there was hardly any table space for our food, it was cool watching the busy cooks make food for the customers. ?I was, however, stuck somewhere between thinking it was hilarious and thinking it was gross that one of the cooks was sweating profusely. ?As always, I thought the best things about the restaurant were the Japanese hipster waitresses, and that goes double for the hostess with the dreadlocks and the two-foot tall Erykah Badu headwrap. The Unatama Don came first, then the Nasubara was served. ?I wasn't sure where the plate of skewers would go at this point because there really wasn't enough table space at the tiny bar. ?But when the dish came, the waitress put it on the serving part of the bar instead of the table part of the bar. ?I should have known that the professionals would know how to best utilise the small spaces in this restaurant! ?The Unatama Don is a bowl of rice with scrampled egg and eel, flavoured with soy sauce. ?I think without the soy sauce, the ingredients might not have came together very well, but the soy sauce really brought the ingredients together. ?The rice was smooth and flavourful. ?The Nasubara is a dish of sauteed pork with eggplant, served with a bit of dried pork shreds on top. ?Admittedly, while this dish was not bad, it was also forgettable. ?Lastly came the skewers. ?They were all pretty good. ?I especially liked the chicken gizzard, but the pork was a bit too salty though. ?As it may be expected, the chicken skin and the pork were both very fatty; I don't think I can eat food like that very often. The last time I was in Tokyo, I was eight years old. ?But a friend of mine who had recently been to Tokyo has told me that Yakitori Taisho is very close to the kinds of restaurants you can find in Tokyo. ?I have a feeling that the other restaurants at St. Mark's Place would probably have the same atmosphere. ?I think I'm definitely going to try another restaurant next time I'm in the neighbourhood.

I really like Yakitori Taisho. ?I mean it's not much to look at, but the food is really cheap and enjoyable. ?It's located in the basement of one of the buildings lining St. Mark's Place, and they offer little in the way comfort. ?In fact, I was seated on a backless chair with a modicum of counter space in front of me. ?In front of my face there was a makeshift firewall which was the only thing separating my face from a very hot stove about a foot away. ?It's not comfortable in the least, and yet it's hip and fun all at the same time. ? Scanning the kanji ridden menu, I opted for the chasyu tonkotsu ramen ($8.50) and ordered a soda to drink. ?I was asked if I wanted a small, medium, or large drink. ?Being thirsty, I opted for the large and thought nothing of it. ?Imagine my surprise when the waitress brought over a 1 liter beer mug filled with soda! ?It garnered looks from just about everyone -- yikes! ?Being that they charge over $5 for this 1 soda, you may want to be on the lookout for this con. ?The soda fiasco aside, I was actually very happy with the ramen. ?It definitely does not compete with the big boys a few blocks away (Minca, Ippudo NY, etc.), but what they are offering here is half the price, so I am judging accordingly. ?The broth was very nice, and I was surprised at just how much flavor it had. ?I loved the generous helpings of pork too. ?The slight use of pickled vegetables added color, texture, and a nice contrast of taste. ?The noodles were basic enough. ?Overall, not too bad. ?I was glad to see that they were solid outside of their yakitori purview. ?Recommend.

BEST chicken teriyaki in NYC! double sauced and grilled..yum! The key to this place is CONSISTENCY. It's been the same since 10yrs ago. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki combo which contains chicken teriyaki (duh) , side salad, scoop of potato salad, spaghetti, and a bowl of rice for $6.95. The bar is the place to sit. However, be prepared for your clothes to reek like food afterwards.The flames from the burners are so powerful that you feel some of the radiant heat in your face..true story. ?Sitting at the bar, In the clear glass display case I could see skewers of the following: mushroom, scallion, garlic , and green peppers. The menu here is very diverse, from udon to french fries to fried oysters. Put it this way, it will take awhile before you eat your way through the entire menu. There is on doubt that the 2 next door competitors have eaten away at this place's market share but it's still the OG one to go to!!! Note: Get there early ~6:30pm if you don't want to wait. This place gets packed to the gills (yes, even on weeknights).

My friend suggested we eat here last night (Wednesday night) as she's been here twice before and loved it. I'm never around Saint Marks and found myself asking...."Ummm, why the hell am I never around here!?!?" This place was pretty easy to find, but I didn't know there were two versions of it next to each other but found my friend. Walking in, the first thing I noticed was this place was very small! And narrow! And packed! I read earlier online that this joint was small and always packed but I thought, as usual, that people were exaggerating, but they really weren't! It was an obstacle course alone just to hang up my coat on the wall! I never eat Japanese food because any kind of food I find "weird" ends up killing my stomach later on. But this place had such tasty food!! I had no idea what to order so I did the whole "I'll have what she's having" thing. I mean, it's not that nothing looked good, it's just that there were so many things on the menu and half of the stuff I couldn't pronounce or recognize, which is fun actually when you want to get the feeling that you're really trying something new. My friend ordered us a plate that had grilled chicken (literally cooked to perfection!!!!) smothered in this somewhat spicy mustard cream sauce thing. As someone said earlier in their review, its got more of a mayo look and taste, but it was damn good! A little too spicy though, I wish it had said in the menu that it was. It also came with a side salad with dressing that I need to find out the name of because I want my own stash! We also ordered the cheese fries which also came with....I'm guessing.....is the same mustard sauce that was on our chicken....but I'm not sure. Either way, the thing was so full of melted cheese, it was hard to find the buried fries! But in a good way :) This is definitely going to be my new spot! And it was so cheap! Two chicken entrees, 2 green teas (I hate green tea YUCK! But I'm sure the cup enjoyed chillin at our table untouched), a plate of cheese fries, and my friend also ordered an appetizer salad for herself, all for $28!!!!!! That's NOTHING!!! I love cheap dinners, the only thing I love more than cheap dinners are free ones, but they weren't handing those out when I was there :) One thing though that makes me want to remove a star is the horrible service!! Our waitress came around about 3x during our dinner of an hour and a half and we asked 3 other waiters for a check....not one of them came back with it!! Until thank goodness a busboy was next to us and we said we've been waiting 25 minutes for a check! I hate service like that, as a cigarette smoker, one after dinner is ranked #1 in the most enjoyed cigs during the day and I don't like to have to delay it waiting for a check in the restaurant!! But, you know what, I can't take away a star for those incompetent waiters, the food was too good! You're being saved Yakitori Taisho....for now.....but next time, gimme my damn check, yo!!

I could sit here all night! Almost everything was superb! We started out with beef tongue, smelt fish, beef intestine, scallop wrapped bacon, and quail eggs. The quail eggs didn't really have any flavor but the rest of the items were very tasty. Also for an appetizer we had the jellyfish tofu salad and salmon carpachio. The spicy jellyfish was a little bland but the salmon was great. Amazing miso clam soup but do not get the salmon with rice in soup; it was very fishy. We ended the night with green tea creme brulee...could I have another one please?? That's how good it was. Service was okay and it's a small place so we were lead to the back and through the kitchen for our table. If you don't want to come out smelling like bbq then sit at a table.

I'm conflicted on Yakitori Taisho; its got an awesome convivial atmosphere but meh on the food. ? Woe that perhaps my friends and I didn't order the right dishes but this wasn't my first rodeo, I've been around the block and had yakitori in Tokyo, so I think I have a good baseline idea of what to expect when I order. The skewers were alright but they were lacking that salty/charry/sweet/meaty/umami oomph that I love with yakitori; even the chicken skin skewer was just OK. The Japanese potato salad was disappointing too, drowned in an unctuous layer of tonkatsu sauce, perhaps a play on mashed potatoes and gravy? I would definitely try it out again, there wasn't anything particularly bad but the food just didn't knock my socks off and with such a simple preparation, yakitori's gotta be right on the money to be good. Others can say what they will, but I liked the small space. ?My friends and I managed to cram together into really what should have been a two-top but the closeness reminded me of sitting down to yakitori in Japan, and hey I like people, table-to-table conversation while drinking is always fun! The small space is conducive to rowdiness as well, I could definitely see drunken shenanigans ensuing after a pitcher or three. Good food, good drinks, and the subsequent good times are at the heart of the Japanese izakaya experience. If you're missing one element, the others are out of place as well. Yakitori Taisho is pretty solid, the food just isn't totally craveworthy. Cheers to two outta three; I shall return to shoot for three someday.

GREAT YAKITORI!!!! Feels like I'm back in Japan, so authentically Japanese without any frills! You'll get a typical Japanese bar food experience! It's a very down to earth place and the price is fantastic. Besides their amazing yakitori, their a la carte menu is very solid too! I love their ika no maruyaki (grilled squid), so soft and deliciously marinated! It's hard to get a table, but it's worth waiting.

It was 9.30PM on a Saturday and the little stretch that is St Mark's just started becoming alive. ? We came mentally prepared for a long wait. ? And a long wait it was - an hour for a table of six. But, having spent enormous amount of time waiting for a table at a bunch of restaurants, we knew that the wait was well worth it, if not more. ? The variety of dishes that we tried were by far THE best and most authentic izakaya dishes we've had: garlic and butter squid, lightly pan-fried pork belly with ponzu glaze, unagi (eel) tofu stew, yaki unagi roll, yaki onigiri, various yakitori (from the standard chicken thigh fillet and beef, to the more esoteric chicken skin, quail egg, ox tongue, AND chicken hearts and gizzard) plus a bowl of spicy chashu ramen to share. I wish that they would have places like this in the Bay Area. ?But then again, on second thought, I couldn't imagine the damage they would cause on my waistline, so... probably not.

After an NYU cultural event, me and some friends were starving and it was about 10pm already so we decided to eat somewhere that was not too heavy and where we could grab some drinks before continuing on with our night..Yakitori Taisho was the spot of choice. ?Before going here, I was expecting sushi rolls and bento boxes but was pleasantly surprised with Japanese cuisine outside of the norm! My friend explained to me that yakitori was like skewers of meat and vegetables cooked Japanese style. I was skeptical at first because it didn't sound that impressive, but we ordered the sampler plate and I loved every bit of it! They had fish balls, steak, chicken, and green onion (?) sticks...DELICIOUS. Their menu contained so many things I never heard of, and it consisted of small Japanese dishes, side dishes, etc. Other people ordered rice bowls and some other stuff I can't remember, but everyone was satisfied with their food and prices were fair. The one big complaint I have about this place is that it's TINY. I literally felt like I was sitting in a Playskool funhouse. The tables were tiny, and the chairs were small--I think only one of my cheeks could fit on their stools. I also had to keep moving so the waiters/waitresses could get through--pretty irritating when you're starving and just trying to enjoy a nice meal. ? Other than that, I would definitely check this place out if you're interested in Japanese food outside of sushi and want some quality food for good prices.

Did the salt shaker top come loose while the chefs were preparing every single dish we ordered? I seriously don't understand the fascination with this place. ?I think honestly, the only real thing it has going for it is the fact that it's cheap. ?Let's just say all of our table couldn't stop drinking water after eating for hours. ?Everything, really EVERYTHING, was EXTREMELY salty. ?We ordered - an "entree" ($8): aka a bento box that came with grilled teriyaki chicken, spaghetti (?), salad, miso soup, and a mashed potato-esque substance (?? they called it potato salad??), everything was eh (spaghetti and mashed potatoes in a Japanese restaurant??) except the chicken, which was again tender but oversalted -Taishodon ($8): a rice bowl-esque thing that came with beef and chicken skewers, egg, and miso soup, skewers were tender and juicy, nothing extraordinarily, although probably the only thing not oversalted we had tonight -two different "hodge podges," (under $7) everything overpowered by the salt, they were also TINY and not very filling or flavorful, definitely needed to be ordered with rice -kimchee udon ($8): SO SALTY, couldn't finish half of it cause I was in desperate need of water! ?The chicken was again tender, probably right off the grill, but completely overpowered by the sodium chloride.... -grilled hokke fish ($9): guess what my critique is? you got it! too salty! Besides the food, the service was HORRENDOUS. ?We got there before a rush of people, but the waitress somehow forgot about us and seated anyone and everyone before us. ?It took much persistence, sweat and chasing the waitresses down after 45 minutes to get our table. ?Then, it literally took us jumping up and down to get their attention. ?Oh and they forgot about one of our entrees I think so by the time the last entree was served, the first person had already finished their meal. ? Like I said, only redeeming quality is the price. ?Otherwise, I'd just go to k-town for BBQ meat. ?If you like the area, St. Marks is FULL of better places, go anywhere else unless desperate.

guys, GUYS, seriously, if I could give more than 5 stars, this is it. cozy atmosphere, very authentic japanese look and feel, and absolutely great food. ?ORGASMIC, this place makes you forget about the time ?My friend and I loved it so much, we had two rounds of food. ?The first round: the extra dry hot sake (forgot what it's called but it starts with a 'H') - absolutely SMOOTH; eel unagi (sorry I can't remember the spelling of everything); potato salad; and oohhh the salmon c-something, that was definitely the highlight of the night. ?In addition, we had fried squid mouth (the sauce was absolutely wonderful); and of course, we had the yakitori (the B-set). ?The yakitori here is absolutely wonderful. ?Please trust me on this one. ?The yakitori is succulent and reaping of delectability (is that a word?) you just feel like getting another set of yakitori. second round: oh shoot, forgot the name but it was pork + avocado (oh man, almost fell off my stool because it was so good; the ramen...i've never had a ramen so good (I keep getting the cheap kind of ramen at japanese noodle places) and oh the aganashi (?) tofu WOw.

I love the tuna tar tar, adore the rice balls/cakes. superb everything!!!! and the staff are really cool... down to earth and zero attitudes. Sit at the bar, it's worth it, even if by the end of your meal you smell like "yaki tori" and get the sapporo pitchers.

cheap but good. haven't tried the fries w/cod roe mayo as recommended by others but it's definitely there on my next trip. love the chicken skin on a skewer though few people seem to appreciate them as much as i do. the clams in broth are awesome. so many choices means there are undiscovered gems which makes each trip a new experience. mouth's watering just thinking about this place... only complaint...place is cramped!

This place was one of the best meals I've had since I moved to New York, and definitely one of the cheapest. My roommate and I went there, as it was recommended to me as a meal not to miss. I went there on a Friday night, and got a table right away, although the restaurant is a bit tiny and cramped. We ordered the spicy cod roe mayo as an appetizer which was super yummy. I ordered some sort of vegetarian dish and my roommate got some of the chicken skewers, which the guy at the table next to us told us we absolutely had to try. Everything was so so good and our final bill ended up being around $40, which also included a glass of wine and a bottle of champagne.

If I ever moved to New York, Yakitori Taisho would be one of the reasons why. I've already professed my love affair for Tajima in San Diego, but Yakitori Taisho has officially taken the gold medal in my heart! I had the spicy ramen and it was superb. The broth was full of flavor and the noodles had just the right chewiness. I love the down to earth, no frills atmosphere. Great place for a low-key dinner with a few friends before heading off to clubbing or whatever you lucky New Yorkers do at night!

Hell yes. ?Okonomiyaki! ?This is the only place that I know of that makes it - with the exception of the take-out takoyaki joint. ?It's solid okonomiyaki. ?I love how bored the waiters are with the customers, but they don't miss a beat. ?The space is some sort of half way underground zig zag that somehow wedged itself between two existing spaces. ?Kind of like when you parallel park in a space that's too small so you end up with a tire on the sidewalk, smashed up against the bumper of the car in front of you with most of your butt hanging out in the street. ?You know it's f***ked up, but it's there and it's working for you so you just let it be.

I'd have preferred to give 3.5 stars if I could, but 4 is just as well since dining here is such a great bargain. ?Our bill came out to something like $14 a person (didn't order drinks), and we were stuffed. We sat at the low bar right in front of the grill, so we could see them prepare everything. ?Since everyone seems to rave about the chicken skin skewers, we ordered a few. ?They definitely had a nice grilled taste, but the grease dripping down my throat kind of ruined the experience. ?We also ordered the chicken meatballs (good) and beef (OK - it was chewy). ?I also got the okonomiyaki -- it was tasty but cold in the middle! ?It seems like they prepare these in advance and microwave them. We also ordered the salmon cream yakisoba, and was dismayed to see them open a frozen yakisoba noodle package (the kind you can buy in a 3-pk in an Asian supermarket). ?But there's no way I can expect noodles made from scratch for $8, plus a decent helping of salmon. ?It was delicious. ?We'll definitely consider coming back to try other things (the kim chi noodles seemed very popular).

okonomiyaki!!! even though it's not the best okonomiyaki, but it's better than nothing! you have to try the chicken meatballs. Just try it! it's only chicken! and have the eel with eggs and tofu!! the fries are really good too. don't be shy with the mayo.

I love Yakitori Taisho! As soon as you come in, you'll be intrigued. Tight space but it's really worth it. I usually start with Agedashi Tofu, spicy tuna, and a set of yakitori...a variety of skewers. Oh and I always end up ordering bunch of shishamo! I thought it was a bit freaky eating it at first but now I'm hooked. Too bad the little fish costs $1.75 per skewer! I usually end up ordering a ramen too because I just keep wanting more food! Yum!

The yakitori is okay (yum chicken meatballs! ?not yum beef skewer) but the other offerings (we tried the stir-fried kimchee noodles, agedashi tofu, and stir-fried vegetables) are just mehhh. ?And I liked the yakitori at (the much more expensive) Yakitori Totto more. ?But for a fun place to eat, drink, and be merry on the cheap, Taisho's a good bet; though I'd probably rather go to Kenka if I'm in the area.

I arrived here around 730 and there was no wait for a party of 2, but by the time I left around 830 there seemed to be at least a 20+ min wait. ?I was glad I didn't have to wait and I have to say the food is pretty good. ?I have tried the other yakitori places on St. Marks and I have to say I liked this one the most. We split the following dishes and I have to say the portion sizes are pretty good compared to other places I've been to. A combo (chicken, chicken skin, chicken gizzard, chicken meat ball, pork (10 skewers) deep fried squid legs tuna salad with avocado, onions and a Japanese mayo sauce The grilled meat was very good. ?Though the chicken skin and gizzards are not for everyone, I enjoyed them and thought they were great. ?The squid legs were nicely battered and crunchy though I wish they served it with a Japanese mayo based sauce. ?The tuna salad was nice and refreshing and the mayo vinaigrette sauce on top was very good. ?Having a good portion of tuna was a plus as well. Overall, a solid meal that was very reasonably priced. ?I'd recommend this place over any of the other places down the block.

I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks--popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops--but hardly any meat. ?Not here. ?Here you can get anything on a stick -- from pork and gizzards to heart and squid. ?Who doesn't love squid on a stick? ?The beers were refreshingly cold as well. ?Everything we tried (soft-shell crab, octopus balls, pork, beef, squid) was grilled to perfection and very flavorful. ?The atmosphere is kinda eh, but you don't go here for the atmosphere, you go here for the meat on a stick and perhaps other menu items.

If you are looking for a wide variety of Japanese food without flies buzzing past you or cooks screaming in your ear, than you might want to try a classier Japanese restaurant. Much like Kenka, or the numerous other Japanese restaurants on St. Mark's Place, the food is barely paid any attention as it is being cooked, and if you order any type of meat, expect to be - without a doubt - severely undercooked. The food is cheap, the service is quick, but as mentioned earlier, no real thought is put into any dish, and this place is more of a late night dive than a legitimate restaurant.

I wouldn't call this place a sushi bar... I mean they may have had sushi, but I went here with some Korean friends of mine and they navigated their way through that menu in a way I couldn't have imaged. This place really hit the spot for what we wanted, quick tasty service after starting the evening drinking a bit too hard and heavy on a school night. With a pack of six, showing up at 8pm on a Thursday, we were able to sit down right away. I couldn't tell you what we ate, but it was fast and delicious. Just a warning, they're something on the menu involving cheese... don't try that.

This joint was my favorite grub place in the city. ?Its been ~7 years since I moved out of there but I still remember sitting on the stumps, munching on beef intestines and chicken meatballs and drinking way too many beers. ?I still have not found a place on the West Coast that serves beef intestines like Taisho. ?Plus the whole yakitori/izakaya thing is starting to become a bit too trendy out here whereas it was always just a fun place to eat and drink in the city.

Our first time to this place sparked instant love. It's crowded... you will have to wait on a weekend for sure... but the food is yummy, affordable and authentic. Basically it is a fun place to start an evening. I recommend the chicken meatballs and we also loved the pork noodles (can't remember the name of the dish).

My yakitori travel has lead me to New York City and I was quite excited to try Taisho. The gorgeous red lamp hanging in front greets you and lets you know you are about to enter a yakitori restaurant. The layout of the restaurant has outdoor seating, bar seating with a great view of the chefs hard at work, and tables towards the back of the restaurant. It is crowded, tight, and dimly light which makes the ambiance very genuine to yakitori restaurants in Japan. I was taken back by the numbers of items on the menu, and I was really struggling inside to determine if this was a good or bad thing. You had items from sashimi to ramen; and to be quite honest the menu was a little bit all over the map. We decided to order the usual suspects off of the yakitori menu to compare the grilling skills and techniques of the chef. In addition we also ordered the skate wing, pork legs, takowasa, and fresh beef liver. Of course I also tested the knowledge of the staff with their recommendation of a smooth sake. The speed at which the items arrived was quite fast compared to other yakitori restaurants I have been to. One of the items I was eagerly waiting for was the skate wing, which I never had before. It was slightly grilled and it tasted a lot like Asian fish jerky. The fresh beef liver was another item I was looking forward to and this was one of my favorite items we had that night. It was sliced paper thin and laid on a bed of onions and vegetables. A simple dipping sauce of sesame oil and salt accompanied the plate for additional flavor. This dish was just natural and unembellished by other ingredients, simplicity is the key. The various yakitori items was served on a full plate of cabbage, the only rub I had was that the cabbage was sitting in all the juices of the meat. I feel that the cabbage helps reset your taste buds to the next item and when it sits in all that juice it defeats the purpose. The chicken skin was soft and a little moist, not to the texture that I prefer. The liver was slightly overcooked since good portions of it was dry. My 2 favorite yakitori items were the chicken wing and sasami mentai. The wing was perfectly grilled, the salt seasoning was spot on. You get the full flavor of the chicken, bone, salt, skin, and charcoal; just a wonderfully executed dish. The sasami mentai is chicken breast with spicy cod roe on top. The different textures and flavors of this dish was also very well done. On top of it, the chef was very liberal with the spicy cod rode which I appreciated very much. I went back for seconds on both the wing and sasami mentai; they are some of the best grilled items I have had in my yakitori journey. I really enjoyed Yakitori Taisho with their large diverse menu and well executed dishes. I would really like to return to try other items on their menu. I thought the chefs did a fine job in executing their dishes and they get full marks. From the yakitori items alone, the chefs are well rehearsed and demonstrated their talent for cooking chicken over charcoal.

This place is always packed and today we decided we would brave the wait and finally check this place out. Surprisingly we did not have to wait long and only waited for about 10 minutes. We ordered the yakisoba with salmon cream sauce, set A of yakitori and the eel, egg and tofu hodgepodge dish. The hodgepodge dish looked huge in the pictures but what actually a pretty small dish. Nevertheless, it was really delicious. The tofu was silky and incredibly fresh and the combination of all three ingredient was perfect. The yakisoba was really amazing. The sauce was creamy with fish roe in it and the yakisoba was al dente. As for the yakitori the best tasting one was the pork belly. Seasoned perfectly and super juicy. Our meal was only $20 and we were stuffed. This place is awesome and the food is so good. I will definitely be coming back more often.

Went to this place after the Oh! Taisho and cannot help but notice that the menu's and decor look similar, and the places are only 2 doors down! Maybe same owner? We ordered ramon, eel rice, yakitori, beef tongue, and seafood. Everything was alright, what you'd expect from a popular place that are short-handed. We seriously did not get any service at all besides getting the food. It was super hectic and we felt that people were breathing down our necks by staring at us eating from the outside.

This is a great place to come whether you are catching up with friends or just try to sober up after a long night of drinking around town. This place is pretty authentic to actual Japanese late night eateries. The wait can be long no matter what time you show up but the food comes out pretty quickly. The mentai potato with the spicy salmon roe is a definite favorite and wash it down with a calpico drink (w/ or w/o alcohol). MMmmm must come back here soon!

Food's really tasty; I wish I could try everything on the menu. However, it gets really busy at night; they like to prepare for that by routinely packing us sardines into the back corners and then filling us into the front. Service is lacking -- they started taking plates away before they were empty, as if they were trying to shoo us out. But, still, I go to restaurants mostly for food, and food here can deserve 4 of 5 stars.

If this review seems unfair or tough, I guess you can chalk it up to being spoiled by such an amazing first experience with Japanese street food (which was not here lol). I may not eat fried foods besides wings during football and I tend to 86 the bread but there will always be a place in my heart and room in my stomach for street meat of any kind, especially when it's on a stick. Be still my heart and get the F out of my way. So you could just imagine how excited and happy I was when I was told "this is the real deal, best place". ?Somewhere possibly better than my place? Ohhhhhhh yeeeeaaaaaaah I'm down! I always get nervous walking into "authentic" places and the ratio of(enter ethnicity here) to non (enter ethnicity here) is totally out of whack. That was the first red flag walking in. The room was very small and extremely narrow (claustrophobics beware). I was underwhelmed by their drink selection. I know it's on St. Mark's and all but it felt a little touristy. I want Sake, not frozen drinks. The Food Rundown: ~ Octopus balls - disappointing. I can't really say much more. Maybe, Yakitori Taisho chefs you should try less batter and bigger than dime sized octopus. And DON' EAT THE PICKLED GINGER CARROTS!! I don't really know if you were supposed to but OMG please, for your mouths sake, don't do it. ~ Teriyaki Squid- Now this is one of the only reasons why this place is getting 2 stars. Delicious! Not chewy or tough in the least. Best I've had so far. ~ French Fries with Codfish Sauce- The sauce is a creamy tartar sauce and just way too fishy for my liking. The Fries were good. They're fries. I wish I had had ketchup ~ Meat Skewers~ 1) Beef Tongue- I like my deli meat sliced extra thin so it's translucent. I prefer skirt steak because it's a thinner cut. Are we seeing a trend here? Fail for me on the tongue. Too thick. Waaaaaayyyy tooooo Thick. 2) Chicken heart- Tasty. Another reason why they're"re receiving 2 stars. I know it may gross out the faint of heart just by the name but I dunno. Muscle taste good. 3) Roasted Garlic- Huge cloves, not roasted nearly enough. I still ate them though. The Italian in me wouldn't have it any other way. 4) Beef Meatballs- I ate 1 and had to force myself to swallow it. For shame. 5) Pork ( Possibly belly but I can't recall)- Little greasy. Like, you focus more on how bad it is for you as opposed to enjoying it. Taste was trumped. And tons of black peppercorn pepper. Lighter hand please Chef! 6) Asparagus wrapped in bacon- Ah and the last reason I am giving Yakitori 2 stars. It's like good and evil fighting in my mouth. Veggies vs. Pork Round One... FIGHT! I think that was it. I did realize that small salads and edamame are imperative when sucking down street meat. Grease vs. Darcy- Grease won. :(

I had no idea that this place was so popular until I came on here but last night I had one of the best meals I've had since moving to NYC. The menu is large and with everything being cheap and a la cart, you could eat here everyday for a week and not eat the same thing. The meats were cooked well, the french fries were delicious and the edamame was fresh. A very positive experience, I can't wait to go again!

I am not too fond of the chicken meat balls, but the others make up for it. ?The atmosphere is dark and dingy, very conducive to drunken chatter. ?I wouldn't necessarily take someone here for our first date, but the crowded cave-like feeling makes it feel very homey. ?The price is reasonable, and I would recommend Taisho to anyone and everyone.

I love Yelp and all you wonderful Yelpers! ?Not only do you help me find delicious eateries but you also help me find lost friends. ?Allow me to elaborate: My bf and I had plans to meet up one of my girlfriends here for dinner. ?And it just so happened that her cell phone died right before she left for work to meet us up. ?She emailed me right before she left the office in Brooklyn ?to let me know her ETA. ?So 30 minutes later, bf and I are waiting at the restaurant and no friend. ?An hour later and still no friend. Hmmmmmmm. ?And no way to contact her... did she get kidnapped? OMG did she get attacked by BNTs on her way back into Manhattan?!?! ?Friend or no friend, we were starving so we got a table and ordered food. ?All the while, I was still worried sick about my friend (it's not like her to leave you out in the cold). ?What happened to her, you ask? ?Well, I owe it all to my fellow Yelpers. ?Like a bolt of lightning, it suddenly struck me that a few reviews about this restaurant mentioned another Yakitori place two doors down. ?Possessed by this revelation, I hypnotically got up from the table and followed the light at the end of the tunnel. ?As I stood outside the restaurant looking in, like a creepy food voyeur, I saw the profile of my friend sitting at the counter all by her lonesome self. ?She was waiting for us for over an hour and finally decided to eat dinner without us. ?Damn you Yakitori Taisho and your evil twin! ?And that is why they are missing the fifth star. Now on to the food review - 2 stars - just for the chicken meatball. ?It's that good. ? 1 star - grilled chicken skin (that's right, I said it!), pork belly, gizzards (if you're an adventurous eater), kimchi noodles and some other stuff that I can't remember what they're called because we usually have about 3 pitchers of beer and sake with our meal. ? 1 star - because they don't yell at you THAT much like some other Asian restaurants. I've never had Yakitori from any other place before but this is A-OK in my books. ?Great atmosphere if you're looking for something very low maintenance, boisterous and affordable! P.S. Sometimes my bf and I like to pretend we're 21 again and do sake bombs. ?This is "frowned upon" at this establishment but if you're a sake bomb ninja like we are, anything is possible!

The wooden stools, tables, cramped seating, and seating amongst the bar where the chefs do their pizazz makes me reminisce back to the good times and eateries in Japan. -Skewers: shrimp, beef balls, bacon wrapped asparagus...all delicious and perfect for those with tiny appetites. -Tuna salad: Mixed greens, avocado, raw tuna, and mayo looking sauce is ideal for those that enjoy light food that leaves you feeling refreshed. -Spicy tuna: Great for those that don't like tuna with huge globs of rice (think sushi rolls). Allows you to leave room to try the other dishes. Cant wait to go back!

This place is my fave hole-in-the wall japanese yakitori. If you just want some light snacks, this is a good place to go to. Order a couple of skewers, beer, gyoza and its a great night with friends. But don't go here for food-food... its not very good. Unless you want fast food quality dinner. the yakisoba was too salty for me, and some kind of seafood pancake was not good. The chili soft shell crab was okay... What I love though is the gyoza and the octopus meatballs, or the meatball skewers. That was very succulent and flavorful.

Insanely crowded unless you go at like midnight, but worth the wait. I love the chicken gizzards and skin and the SMELT! The pitchers of Japanese beer are great for washing down the skewers of meat.

The first thing to understand about Yakitori Taisho is that you don't come here for great atmosphere or phenomenal service. ?You won't be lovingly attended by waitstaff who will rush to bring you a black napkin so that the white napkin won't leave unsightly fibers clinging to your black pants. ?Your water glass may run dry at times. ?If that's a dealbreaker for you, you should probably avoid Yakitori Taisho and quite possibly all of the restaurants around St. Marks. ?If you're willing to squeeze into a cramped bar and wait 45 minutes to perch on a stool, Yakitori Taisho will reward your patience with simple but remarkably effective food. Yakitori is basically chicken kebabs. ?Every part of the chicken that can be skewered is fair game, however, so you've got liver, heart, skin, etc. ?There are also pork and beef options, as well as smelt and squid skewers. ?Each skewer is $1-$3 in price, so I strongly urge you to sample to your heart's content. ?The meat is coated in a thin, slightly sweet sauce and placed upon a large iron grill to cook for a few minutes. ?The taste of char from the grill goes really well with the meat and sauce. ?I was particularly fond of the chicken skin, which was crispy, chewy, and moist, and the pork, which was delightfully fatty and full-flavored. ?The smelt was good too, but a quick warning - it's full of roe/caviar, so it's best to eat it all in one bite so as to avoid showering yourself in tiny little smelt eggs. ?A shout-out to the skewer of three large scallops wrapped in bacon for $2.75. ?They are delicious, and you could pay $30 for them if you ate somewhere a little more downtown. ? The menu is very extensive, and so I didn't experiment with most of their traditional Japanese fare, but I did get the spicy tuna tartare to start, which was pretty good. ?Stay away from the grilled rice balls, however, unless you know that you're going to like them; I wasn't especially pleased with mine. ?Also stay away from the bowl specials - my friends ordered them, and let me tell you, they look way better in the pictures, and the rice tasted like not-so-great kimchee. ?A special mention should go to the beer - pitchers of the ubiquitous Japanese lagers for $12 is pretty reasonable, especially for Manhattan. Get one to share with a friend or two, and you will remain blissfully oblivious of the aforementioned water shortages. ? Five stars. ?Yakitori Taisho does one thing, and does it well, without pretension. ?They don't try to pretend to be anything other than what they are - a simple place that takes simple food seriously. ?Low prices let you try the whole range of their yakitori offerings, and you should. ?$20 will net you a gigantic, fantastic meal here, a rare distinction for restaurants in NYC.

I was skeptical about whether a restaurant on St Mark's could be any good. I mean, is there this Japanese bbq could be any more authentic than the mass-produced, perfectly worn CBGB's t-shirts sold at the Official CBGB Gift Shop a couple doors down? But as you can see from my five star review, my fears were unfounded. ?Absolutely great meal. ?Just like others have said, there was about a 45 minute wait for two - but you know what? There's no better place to kill time than hanging out at Kim's, St Mark's Comics, Search and Destroy, and so on. ?The time flew by, and soon we were seated in the cozy (not small!) dining room. ? As others have pointed out, the killer part of the menu is that all the BBQ skewers are about $1.75 to $2.00 each, so you can EASILY load up on a ton of different options. I got some noodles and fried rice on top of it, and everything was great - the beef, the chicken, the numerous options wrapped in bacon (but can you really screw that up?). ?We over-ordered for two, but the bill was still under $30. Look, I was like you once - staring at the number of five stars wondering if there was any way a St Mark's establishment could have tasty food. Just take the risk and go - and then come to Yelp and give it a five star review!

So glad we picked this spot to eat. I love St. Marks Pl, there are so many good places to choose from. This one is no exception. We had the yakitori platter A and then ordered the spicy tuna bowl, pumpkin tempura, rice ball, and maybe some more things I can't remember. Everything was great, and we could have ordered about 17 more bowls of that spicy tuna. So delicious. Our wait didn't take too long. It's tiny and the space is very narrow so claustrophobics, beware.

Got there early enough on a Monday and there was no wait at all. It was fun sitting at the counter and watching the sexy men prepare my food. The food was cheap, yes- but not quite as good as I hoped. The bacon wrapped scallop was definitely not a scallop, honestly, I have no idea what the hell that bacon was wrapping. The chicken meatballs were a favorite, chicken skin could have been crispier. Great potato salad that came with our entree of 5 yakatori skewers along with miso soup, turnip, salad, and some questionably spaghetti. The deep fried squid was ok. Nicely priced fun vodka drinks. I would come back, I would just need to drink a lot more before eating to really enjoy the place as it should be enjoyed.

When I traveled in Japan, one of my favorite places was Hiroshima and it's little den restaurants with delicious Japenese goodies! Yakitori is as close as you get in New York. Amazing and extensive menu with delicious items! Pitchers of Kirin are $12 and I crave the Ramen Ngiri all the time. It's all delicious! I go here at least 2-3 times a month. They are open late and sometimes you have to wait a little bit (10-20mins) but it is well worth the wait. :)

This was one of my favorite places to eat during my college days but it has rapidly deteriorated into a mediocre spot at best. What used to be a relatively unknown establishment ?that catered to mostly japanese / asian students has turned into a over-expanded tourist attraction. ?The last time I came here I couldn't even chew my chicken yakitori's because they were so cold and tough. ?I can think of 3 places in st mark's place alone that serve better yakitori. Sadly, the time has come and gone for this once legendary eatery.

I don't know what better way for a crowd of friends to have fun but with skewered meat and pitchers of beer. It's like your own backyard boogie without having to clean up the mess. Plus, this was during March, so it was still too cold outdoors for BBQ's. I definitely recommend the chicken gizzards, bacon wrapped everything, and a shower afterwards. If there's a line, run upstairs to the karaoke room and grab a beer while you wait.

Lived in NY for a 2 months or so. My drunk self always seemed to wander back here. But my sober self loves it as well. I usually get the Yakitori Sampler A (the one without the unusual meats) and split with someone. LOVE THEIR Hakata Pork RAMEN. I think it's better than Ippudo's. Almost as good as Daikokuya (in LA). Funny story, my friend and I wandered here drunk on our trek from 3 sheets saloon to 13 steps. I had another friend waiting for us at 13 steps but we HAD to have our ramen. Mind you, it was about 90 degrees at night, sweat dripping down our faces as we walked, but it was a craving we had to satisfy. We both ate ours in 5 minutes. Came out even more drunk (I guess from the heat) but super content! Line is sometimes long especially at night. Crowded seating. I'm going back to NY in the winter and am coming here!

So I like Yakitori Taisho for it's selection of dishes, and its grilled fare. I'm not a huge fan of yakitori, but I am a huge fan of grilled. Oh yes, bacon and scallop, green onion, chicken meatballs, the list goes on. The only thing more awesome than the grill selection is the ability to a la carte to your wildest dreams. I dared the roast pork ramen, salmon rice ball, seaweed salad, and 3 yakitori's. I already know what I'm getting next time, a tuna lover's meal with tartare, grilled tuna sashimi, and the tuna and avacado salad. The food is tasty and diverse, you needn't fear your own crazy combination of dishes.

Very surprised to see high rating for this place!! Yakitori is a joint unlike anything else where food is served! On a cold December Thursday, after a referral from a friend, we headed there...hoping for some warmth and great food! First impression, that the place looked like some sort of trailer with rustic dated interior and obvious lack of hygiene, with dirty floors and such. Then, the crazy part: the hostess guided us thru some wierd corridor, which looked very dirty, into another "dining shed" where they managed to cram about 25 people.Some Yelpers are dreaming to dine there,but I tell you--There's nothing there to brag about!! We were seated into a tiny table about 2x2 ft in the corner next to the door (which is permanently shut) and the wind from underneath blew right into my butt). How in the world are u supposed to enjoy a dinner like that??? Well, the yakitori itself wasn't bad, but it was nothing to write home about either, it arrived kinda cold, so we couldn't enjoy it as much. The meat was leathery and not of decent quality. Also, the joint is quite pricey. The service is somewhat ignorant and slow as the place is always packed beyond its allowed limits. So the choice is yours, whether u want to suffer like that to get your meal, I'm heading some place else for mine!

I've been going to this place for about 4 years now and I can honestly say it is an entirely different experience every single time. In an effort to be accurate as opposed to politically correct I will say that if you are asian or have an asian friend with you, you will be seated first. ?I am not asian, dont hold this against the place, and still continue to come back. I stronnnngly recommend the kimchee yakiudon, spicy with pan fried noodles, pieces of delicious pork and tender cabbage- its delicious. It used to be a mainstay for underage drinkers, and it sort of still is, but the large cocktails are precisely that - and delicious. Also, if you like your meat well done/really cooked...the yakitori may not be for you. Stick to the veggie ones like asparagus.

First things first...this place always, I mean ALWAYS has a line unless you get there when it opens around 5. But wait! There is a reason for this ever-present line! The food is deeeelicous! Always good. Some of my faves are the chicken ball skewer (like little chicken meatballs with peas) the agadashi tofu, and on a cold or rainy day go for the ramen. It is a very small, cramped place, but cozy and nice at the same time. They are also open pretty late too so to avoid lines go when they open or after 11, otherwise be prepared to wait. On the bright side, since it's on the corner of St Marks and 3rd you have some pretty good people watching while you wait!

I like this restaurant very much. It has a lively atmosphere and the food is delicious. I especially like the ramen - the noodles have a good tooth to them and the broth is an opaque sesame elixir. The yakitori is also very good, with my favorites being the chicken skin, chicken gizzards, and pork. They serve the skewers on a bed of raw cabbage, and I think I have now gained an appreciation for raw cabbage, due to looking for something else to nibble on after the skewers. i suppose the fact that I choose to eat raw cabbage rather than ordering more skewers indicates that the price might be a bit higher than I like, but I think that tends to be a common occurrence in Japanese restaurants for me and my big american belly.

The only negative experience I have had here was when I was without one of my Asian friends. ?The servers gave us a hard time about sitting at a table that could accommodate four people although the place was empty. ?We were finally sent a few doors down, where we were assured it would be the same food but with tables and chairs built for the ginormous whiteys. ?However, they didn't have the critical fried oysters here (the only difference!) and they wouldn't go two doors down to hook it up. ?WTF! ?Yikes, I just remembered how much that sucked, and I decided to demote to four stars. ?Still great ... when with Asian friends seemingly.

A friend took me here shortly after I moved to the area. I had seen yakitori on Travel Channel with Bourdain and Zimmern so I wanted to experience it. It was definitely an experience! So Yakitori is basically, Japanese street food a type of Japanese bar and grill. The idea is to eat good food with beer - Japanese beer. Or sake. The place is tiny. Very much similar to the images on the Travel Channel shows. You squeeze in and sit on pretty small tables and chairs. But that's part of the charm. Unlike other Japanese restaurants, this is very much "street". There's no clean symmetrical lines or any of the typical "Japanese" decor that sushi places have. It's like a bar grill - Japanese style. The food is fabulous. Very different from sushi or hibachi or other Japanese-style food. The food is fun, it's good, it's surprisingly filling. The menu is just loud and bright, kinda like looking at ads on the streets of Chinatown or looking at those bright chinese takeout menus - only more fun. The food? Incredible. There is a ton of variety from yakitori (chicken hearts, livers, skin or squid on a stick) to onigiri (rice balls) to noodles. There's also tempura and some other stuff that I've never heard or seen before but are good. My first time there, we ordered yakitori - chicken hearts, liver, and gizzards. We ordered a pumpkin tempura - a different kind of pumpkin, not the American pumpkin. We also ordered soft shell crab, and the fries with a fish roe mayo sauce. That was spectacular. The brine from the roe mixes really well with the mayo - and dipping that steak fries sized fries added a lot of flavor. We also had something I've never heard of before - a Japanese pancake, I think? Someone else might know better. I saw tons of tables with that dish. It was pretty good, a mix of a lot of ingredients. The sauces they used, however, was a combo of some savory sauces and mayo. Not sure if it was some kind of teriyaki reduction or not, but the sauces worked very well. My second time around was with another friend, from DC, and we both enjoyed a light meal there. This time we tried the chicken skins. It was actually really good. The skins were crispy on the edges and the rest tasted like the skin coming off of a rotisserie chicken. There are a ton of variety of dishes to try, so this is one of those places to frequent. The downside is that the wait can be long - especially on a Friday or Saturday night. So when you get in, be prepared to eat! St. Mark's Place is also a great area to walk around. That little street is like little Japan. Yakitori Taisho is 1 part of 2 yakitori places. The other is also on St. Mark's Place called Oh Taisho. But the area has udon and ramen restaurants, bubble tea, and other asian restaurants. There's also an afghani and hookah place and lots of shops. In fact the shops are really interesting. One shop is loaded with adult novelty and lingerie - with a shop next to it selling hookahs and bongs. It's a fun, interesting area to walk around as you wait for your table! With the fun area and the variety of food and the great dining experience, Yakitori Taisho is definitely a place I will frequent.

Great, cheap, no frills location for skewers and other grilled deliciousness. Expect the line to be long, the seats to be uncomfortable and the food to be greasily good. Not surprisingly, the place isn't particularly vegetarian friendly. For something a little less heart clogging, try the duck breast - while not as tender and good as a high end restaurant, it's definately very good for a $10 cut of meat.

Food: This place would have easily gotten a 5 star rating a few years back. Comparing then to now, the quality of the food dropped. The yakitori occasionally comes out cool/warm instead of hot. Probably too many customers waiting to be seated that they rush things up front. The salmon and spicy cod roe rice balls hardly contains any ingredients, 97% rice. The kimchi yaki udon is far too salty and consistently has two pieces of beef. Forget about the grilled squid, too tough and un-chewable. All these are recent developments. There are still a few reliable dishes. The mentai fries with mayo/cod roe sauce is still addictive. Fries fried well and lots of cod roe in the mayo, however the portion got alot smaller (use to come in a bucket, now a tray). The fried chicken is still good too. I guess the overall quality of fried foods didn't change over time. Never liked the okonomi yaki, too thick. Wish it was thinner, but that is personal preference, flavor is good though. Drink: Great environment to slam back some Japanese beer (Asahi, Kirin) or sake. Sake selection is pretty weak, but after a few pitchers of beer just order the cheapest one, would be a waste to order a good one by then anyway. The cocktails are horrible, basically juice, stay away! Service: Big drop off in this department, likely due to the popularity of the place. Remember sitting here till whenever we felt like. If you don't order now, get prepared to get kicked out. If you order slowly and drag out the night, prepared to get dirty looks. Crowd/Ambiance: Love the feel of this place. Packed as hell, can't walk in or out without offending everyone on line. Everything from the exposed bricks, grill up front, to the cramped stool seating adds to the intimate and festive feel of the place. Results in drinking way too much. Expect to spend hours waiting for a seat Fri/Sat night.

Cramped, dirty. ?Get smashed, eat food with excess carbon. ?Yum. ?Don't be too dainty. ?Get some beer going and you'll have a good time. ?Be loud, be hungry. Japanese small plates, but the highlight is the selection of skewers. ?Gizzards, gogo! ?With luck, they will over-cook instead of undercook

Maybe i was craving Japanese food or something, but I loved it here. There are lots of menu choices, maybe this is bad thing because my friend and i totally over ordered. Between the 2 of us, we ordered the B combo (chicken, chicken meat balls, scallions, shrimp, beef), the seafood pancake, rice with salmon in broth, and sauteed noodles in salmon cream sauce. Very well priced. Great service. We didn't have to wait too long because it was a Wednesday night. Another, "definitely coming back the next time I'm in NYC"

The food here is delicious and yet somehow never makes your wallet weep! ?I come here often and always aim to be at Yakitori Taisho around the time they open their doors for the evening since then you get a seat right away (I also tend to go with a group of at least three). We order for the table with: Geso Isobe (Fried Squid Legs Tempura) Skewers of Tsukune (Chicken Meat Ball) Rock Shrimp Tempura with a spicy cod roe and mayo sauce Yaki Unagi Roll (cooked eel inside with a kind of mayo dressing drizzled on top) Taisho style steak We've also tried with great success: The BBQ Pork with Avocado Salmon Onigiri Sweet Potato Tempura and our only disappointments have been: Fish cake Yakitori Taisho is a hole in a wall that you walk down into. ?It is crowded and noisy but for delicious food at insanely low prices, Taisho cannot be beat. I have even taken my parents here and they loved it so much they still beg me to take them back here, reminiscing about how very delicious our meal was. ?In fact, every friend I have ever brought here has become a Taisho convert, raving about the place afterward and always suggesting it for dinner when we get together. The service is quick and they constantly check on your drinks. ?Taisho has a busy casual atmosphere that is low on pretensions but high on taste. ?Enjoy your meal, get some plum wine or beer and all will seem dandy. ?If you still feel hungry, the servers are always happy to get you more.

The food here is really delicious! I love japanese bbq so I am huge fan of taisho. They usually open at 6pm and stays open late. The food is usually delivered fast and they have a lot of stuff to choose from. Be warned, this place gets packed! If you are going later on in the night...8pm on, the line to get a table is 45min- 1 hr. Although the food is good, i have no patience to wait this long. The tables are also bunched up together, and there little space for your coats and bags. The bathroom is tiny too and there is a long wait for that too sometimes. The staff is always friendly, the food is delivered on time and it's always good and consistent.

food on a stick is pure love for me. food on a grill is pure love for me. the both of these forces combined is oh so right. yes, it is overrated. yes, i know it's like wee pieces of something on a grill. i *like* the taste of burnt....sometimes. yakitori taisho is crowded, busy, gets hot up in there, and the service is almost mechanically fast. you may wait too long and your patience will be tested, but -food on a stick-, keep your focus, remain steadfast. there is a wide selection to drink and eat. my favorites are: scallions, asparagus in bacon, chicken in plum sauce, ?kimchi udon, and even spicy ramen. ?[3.25 stars]

Super happy to finally get to try this place. I loved the beef plate (from the front page of the menu). So so tasty. I also loved the beef tongue skewers. The salmon cream yakisoba was good, but really super filling. I dunno if I could even split it with someone else. Probably better to share with a party of 3+ because it's super heavy. I love the atmosphere here. Despite it being cramped, it's got a hearty feel and the hot sake is perfect on a cold night!

Been here quite a few times now and realized I've never reviewed this place. The food here has always been delicious! ?Last night I ordered the 10 skewers combo (chicken, chicken balls, shrimp, beef, and scallions) and got 2 skewers of each. ?The chicken was yummy, white meat, but not dry and overcooked and tasteless as I often find white meat to be. ?The chicken balls were also tasty, different since I hardly ever eat chicken balls (I mean, meatballs made of chicken, not, you know, the other kind of balls...come to think of it, do chickens even have balls??). ?ANYWAYS, the beef was good flavor, but a little chewy. ?The shrimp was ok, not as flavorful as the beef or chicken. ?And, um, it was interesting eating skewers of just scallions, but ok, since I like scallions =) ?This all came on top of a bed of cabbage with....teriyaki sauce?? I also ordered a side of deep-fried cheese, which were quite tasty, and not dripping in oil as fried cheese often is. ? Very crowded restaurant with a long bar to sit at in the front, a small middle area, and a small back room. ?There are hooks all over the walls to hang your coats/scarves/etc. ?Gotta be careful when you're walking around. ?I figure it must be difficult for anyone even a little overweight to maneuver around this place. ?I picture this is how crowded Japan must be like.... Looking forward to coming back and eating more skewers of scallions and chicken...balls ? =)

Totally the best in the city. ?We went as a party of 6 on Saturday night and even in this tiny joint had us sat within 15 minutes. ?Incredible variety and friendly staff. ?Highlights - rice balls with the pickled plum, the mixed protein 'pancake' with squid, shrimp, pork and plum sauce, and the yakisoba, while straightforward is packed with flavor. ?The bathrooms are a little scary, but I think that's part of the ambience.

First order of business: You don't go to Taisho for the food, OK? It's a bar... a place to get drinks that also happens to have a TINY kitchen in it - one that spits out some kickass yakitori at very reasonable prices and blinding speed. ?You go to Taisho for drinks, OK? Then after your first drink, and only then, do you order some mediocre, salty food - but food that is by far the BEST accompaniment to cold beer that I have ever found!! If you're just looking for depth of flavor and sophistication, rather than getting blackout drunk, try Typhoon, Sobaya, Hagi, Yokocho, or Kenka... all places where you can better savor the flavor of the dish... but if you want to get drunk in a hole-in-the-wall where nobody will judge you... Taisho can't be beat! So basically, don't go to Taisho if you're not planning on drinking. I've been going there weekly since 2000 (I was a Cooper Union student) and remember when smoking was allowed inside! Smoke from the Grill, smoke from the Fryer, smoke from the Burners, Smoke from the scantily clad girl at the seat next to you... it was a haze of smoke and beer and sake and women - it smelled of perfume, sake, and vomit at almost any time of the evening and I LOVED it! It was always on my list of stops - Panya in the morning and Taisho at night - those were the two mainstays. If you get there early it's a very "happy hour" sort of vibe; if you get there late at night you're almost guaranteed to see some group of red-faced Korean guys fighting over a girl; a bunch of Japanese artists/musicians seducing the girl (probably on vacation) at the neighboring table. It's the sort of place that just reeks of pickups, one night stands, breakups, and falling in "love." If it's busy, and you have good ears, you're guaranteed an interesting time people-watching at least. I used to show up with my wallet, a book, and the rest just magically happened. The food is not "sushi quality," in fact, the inside (at least of the old Taisho) is pretty damn close to breaking a bunch of NY State Sanitation laws... But just like when you go camping and cook over a fire and the food and drink make everything better, that's what Taisho has to offer - food with a speck of dirt here or there; it's more about the bucket loads of good atmosphere and the adrenaline rush of a food moshpit - the constant shouting of customers, cooks, and servers. If you go to Taisho looking for sushi you're missing the whole point - go to a SUSHI BAR for that - Taisho grills, frys, and sautes protein to Drunken, Salty Perfection. I remember one late night where it was me and some of the cooks up front, maybe a table or two out back; one of the cooks was sweeping and doing a bit of downtime cleaning with a cigarette dangling from his lip, The Yellow Monkey was on the stereo, and we were joking and laughing and drinking beers... and then in walks a group of drunk girls, all very pretty, all in miniskirts... 6 in all... we continued to get drunk together, tell stories, and then hit Karaoke. Taisho is that sort of place - one minute you're alone and in thought, the next you're drunk and laughing with a friendly stranger, while still other nights you're fighting over some stupid thing or puking your way down St. Marks. Some of the staff may come across as mean... but they have to work in one of the rudest parts of the city, with people being constantly drunk and belligerent, all while not being native English speakers... you'd be pretty grumpy if that was your daily gig too. Try everything. Seriously. Just start with an appetizer, and keep ordering until you've tried a bunch of them. Nothing's really "bad," but some things are better than others. The Mentai Potato, Buta Kimchi, Buta Mayo, Okonomiyaki, Mentai Yaki Onigiri, Kawa Yakitori, Kimchi Nabe, Unagi Dofu, Agedashi Dofu, El Hire, and Duck Breast "Balsamico" are all extremely popular dishes that never disappoint. It's a place dominated by "regulars," so look around and see what people are having, and try that. Can't imagine this place ever closing. Long Live everything that Taisho stands for!

This place... We trekked over around 10 PM since Ippudo was an hour and a half wait despite it being a Tuesday and we were starving, so this was the next Yelped option. Cute, hole in the wall, and I mean a definite hole. Small, cramped, claustrophobic, and the workers look like they hated life or were indifferent about their job. We were told 10 minutes, then 20 minutes later we ask again and were told 5 minutes, which turned into half an hour. We understand we were a large group and it was busy, but the way they run the place was really inefficient; I witnessed a table asking 4 times before they finally got the check, which wasn't even taken care of by their server. Too tired and hungry to go elsewhere, we miserably waited to get seated. By this time everyone already knew what they wanted to order since we had waited so long. I ordered the Taisho special ($8.75), which is a rice bowl with skewered chicken chunks, beef chunks, and chicken meatballs that comes with a bowl of miso soup. There are other dishes or you can order individual skewers or sets. I also ordered a side of potato salad. The soup was very nicely flavored, light but strong like miso soup should be. My annoyance was a bit alleviated at this point. Then the bowls come out, and holy hell, they were HUGE. They had a bit of cabbage slaw in there and some pickled vegetables which rounded out the rice and skewers very well. The yakitori sauce was a amazing, and the meatballs were my favorite for sure. The potato salad (which was forgotten until asked for) was not my thing since it was a scoop of mashed potato with a strange flavor and drizzled with the yakitori sauce. But at this point I was too full to even eat more than a couple of bites. Definitely worth it if you don't have to suffer through the wait, and who knows, the service might be better than what I noticed on this particular day, but I definitely don't think it was worth what I had to go through.

Great place!! I finally found a place to get real Japanese skewers. But way too many people,and space is limited. Everything on the stick is good, and I also recommended the grilled nigiri and ika yaki (a dish of grilled squid). Ramen tasted good as well. The salmon cream yakisoba looks so good, but I was too full to take a bite.

The only thing that stands out about Yakitori amongst the ethnic eateries on Saint Marks is their Japanese BBQ skewers...a new concept to me. ?During the warm months, the restaurant opens its storefront and places 2 additional tables outside. ?There is also one bigger table in the front of the restaurant, seats along the BBQ "bar" and a few more tables in the back. ?I found the restaurant quite cramped. ?It was also not very clean...Oddly you have to walk through the kitchen/storage area to get to the bathroom. ?I opened the door to find a hideously dirty toilet and wet, dirty floor. ?I turned around and went back to my table instead of entering that mess. ? In terms of the food, it was mixed. ?The prices are affordable and the portions the size of large tapas. ?My friends each ordered a bunch of dishes, but I stuck to the chicken teriyaki entree. ?This included a miso soup, white rice, Korean-style potato salad, a small garden salad, and spaghetti (which is really like Italian spaghetti with dried out tomato sauce-not what I expected). ?Minus the oddly matched spaghetti, the rest of my meal was good. ?However, I tried a few of my friends' dishes, but did not like most of them. ?The rock shrimp and mustard sauce special was horrendous. ?The fried shrimp were too doughy and flavorless. ?The mustard sauce was very creamy like mayo. ?It was heavy and way too overpowering. ? To make matters worse, the shrimp were drowning in it. ?It is very rare that I dislike a kind of food, but the fried octopus balls were the grossest thing I have ever tasted. ?In my opinion, they tasted like how the "new car smell" ...smells. ?It was horrible! ?On a bright note...the french fries with spicy mayo were very good. I guess if you are interested in cheap eats and in the area, it's decent.

I consider this one to be the step-child of the Taisho family. For some reason, I always love the other Taisho place better. The other one has better unatamadon, since I don't think this place offers it. However, this place does have a cute back room. Anyway, just flip a coin if you're not sure which one to go to. The food is almost the same, but Oh Taisho definitely has better quality imho.

After hearing a friend rave about this place as a must try in NY, and how she can eat Yakitori all day every day, I knew I had to give this place a go, however all these expectations only rendered sub-par food. This place is a SHACK, literally. ?With that said, prepare to be crammed, when waiting and eating. ?Despite the setting, this place seems to pride itself in its undiscoverable dungeon of intense flavors. ?I ordered the skewers, like everyone else trying this place for the first time along with some squid tofu and pancake fused with pork and sea food. ?Nothing was exceptional! ?NOTHING! ?The chicken skewers were dry, chicken gizzards are tough and just plain disgusting, and the meat balls... I don't know, you call this a meat ball?? ?The squid dish was alright, nothing to rave about. ?The pancake while appetizing in picture failed miserably in flavor. ?One thing I really really despise is when chefs drain their dishes with so much sauce that the substance of the dish merely melts to the background and becomes an afterthought. ?This is the pancake, I'm not sure if it was all the hoisin sauce or the mayonnaise, but this pancake would give anyone a heart attack. ?We hoped our fried ice cream dessert would have some redeeming qualities, but it was nasty! Here's the thing about fried ice cream, at a top notch restaurant, this fried layer is so thin that when it is broken all you taste is the ice cream. ?This fried ice cream had such a heavy layer of mochi that the ice cream was nowhere to be found! ?Save yourself the hassle, this hidden gem has lost its gleam! ?SKIP IT!!!

It's a 3.5 really. I didn't love this place because of my high expectations. While everyone seems to love this place, it was kinda of so-so for me and my friend. The chicken skin being the let-down for me, it was too fatty and unevenly cooked with some spots overly charred and some spots undercooked (wasn't raw of course, but undercooked). And my friend hated the gizzard (I'm not a fan either), while I know its texture isn't for everyone, that's not the problem, it was very bland. The plain meat skewers are ok, but nothing special. That said, when I'm feeling yakitori but don't feel like paying Totto's price, I'd still come here and stick with hard-to-get-wrong skewers.

So I have always heard about this place and finally got around to try it . Got in early before all the big crowds and WOW ! This is about as authentic as you get I ate at a similar place in Japan except I think this place was better and there was no one smoking like in Japan . The food is cheap and just incredibly tasty , I can recommend bacon wrapped asparagus , chicken in plum sauce , and the beef yakitori , actually all the yakitori was great so be adventurous and try them all you will love every bite and might just possibly discover something new that you didnt know you liked ! I cant wait to go back !

Tight seating, cheap prices, sticky menus with small hand-written English and lots of meat and rice on sticks. ? It is defiantly a little intimating at first, but plow yourself on in and grab a seat. ?The rice balls are so fantastic you may have to scoop yourself back into your chair with your chopsticks to finish your meal. ?Try some of the specials to really dig into the atmosphere and it's worth grabbing a seat at the bar, despite the squeeze, to watch the chef's cook and try to balance the food into shapes.

Just like every other Japanese resturant on St. Marks Place... packed, cheep, delicious! The skewers were delicious, and so was the sweet and sour pork. The waiters were kind, and we were the only americans in the place. Get there early so you don't have to wait too long!

4 stars for the price and the variety of food here. but deduct it to 3 stars for the taste and ambiance. I have a HUGE problem with the tiny room they set up in the back of the restaurant. you heard me. all the way in the back of the restaurant beside the restroom. they set up a tiny dinning area with 5, 6 tables and chairs. I felt like suffocating while eating my meal. Some items are good but some are just very bland. Most of their yakitori are good especially their chicken and pork items. However their other food are just soso and the pictures on their menu can be deceiving compared to the actually dish. I really want to recommand this place for a group of people wanting to get wasted with good selection of alcohol and some japanese street food. But the place is so small and crampped you cant adaquetly seat a group of more than 3 people. there are better options.

I came here over the summer for my birthday, and yes this is my first Japanese spot that I had yakitori.. the food and company was good, but the only bad point, was that my friends was sitting near the door, so our feet was exposed to the elements, it was raining, and let' s just say that mosquito's feasted on our legs that night.

Chicken skin!! All their skewers are good, but the chicken skin is the best. Price isn't bad and you won't break the bank coming here and will leave full. Huge menu, so lots of options. This place is always packed though and generally a long wait - but it's a sign as to how good the food is.

I've definitely had better experience eating at yakitori restaurants. This place was so small and narrow. The food came out pretty fast, but that was the only perk. The food was mediocre. The wait staff wasn't the nicest. We went on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy, but they can at least do better than just ignoring your numerous times when they walk by. ?Yakitori Totto was so much better!!!

whenever ppl mention yakitori, i know they are talking about this restaurant - its so yummy, its so good, blah blah, blah, blah. it is all true. it is very yummy it is very good. so needless to say, there is always a freaking line here! get there early and beat the crowds (we got there around 6pm on a sunday). def get the yakitori, after all it is their signature dish (the dishes are small so the prices add up esp if you are a fatty like me), get the smelt, the fried mackeral, and raw octopus in wasabi sauce. theres so much to try i just want to order everything! only con is that it is very cramped and try not to sit at the grill bar, it is so HOT, dont know how the cooks do it. the cooks are HOT, esp with the long hair and funky style...the japanese are so eccentric! i like!

Why is there always a line out the door? Becaus.e it's cheap? or is the food is good? ?I can tell you that the food is definitely below mediocre. ?It is a joke to even say that this place has decent yakitori. ?The chicken they use is bad quality, even Perdue chicken is better. ?Yes they are moderately priced, but I rather pay that extra money to eat at a real yakitori joint. ?As a Japanese person, I am ashamed that someone would even open a restaurant with horrendous quality food. ?That said, I don't want to sound like a hypocrite, but I do come here on occasion because my friends like going to this place and I just don't have the heart to tell them this place sucks.

I'm not here to rave about the yakitori... I know... what good am I then... but I actually like many of the other things on their menu other than the yakitori. I think their yakitori is decent. Not out of this world, but ok. My favorite dish there is their Unagi Tofu. OUT OF THIS WORLD! I love tofu, eel, and eggs, and this dish combines all three (I'll just overlook the scallions)! I also like their grilled Onigiri, particularly the salmon and the plum, although sometimes you have to dig through the pile of rice to find the hidden jem within. The Ika Yaki is delicious (well quality fluctuates a little, but generally it's quite good), and their kimchee dishes are not bad. Their Takoyaki is ok, but I do NOT recommend their Okonomiyaki. Maybe I'm just picky, but I think their okonomiyaki just has too much mayo. I'm generally not a mayo hater, but too much of it makes me feel unhealthy (eh), so I've learned to avoid this dish. Most of their other dishes (with no mayo - for some reason they really like to douse things in mayo when it's present) are decent. It's a pretty good combination of Japanese street food. Service is passable. It's a Japanese place, but it's also really busy with relatively few servers. I don't expect stellar service. I've never had a problem there, except when they misunderstand me... but that's a typical NYC story. Space is rather (ok extremely) crammed. There are hanger on the wall for jackets so please be sure to get them out of the way so they don't get trampled on or food spilled on them.

I was introduced to Yakitori by my husband and his friends, whom used to go late at night after they closed up their cafe. ?It was their Saturday late night ritual every week! I was not impressed by my first visit, I ordered Chicken teriyaki and it was dry. However, my husband loves this place and it grew on me. I have gotten brave and tried more things on the menu and now I really enjoy going. Its a small cramped space that gets very busy and they usually have a wait. The tables are small and close together, with people often bumping into you. However, no one seems too bothered by it. The music brings a different experience each time as it always changes. This place is not open during the day, but they stay open late. Its a fun place to go after a night out to chill and have some good food. Their prices are good too! Food is good, not great, but good. It is more like street BBQ, but I like it! Do not go for the ambiance, its not a fancy place by far. I like to order the hot sake and edamame, aspara mentai or potatoes mentai (both are good), and I love love love the yaki unagi roll. I also like the Yakisoba and Unatama Don.

A good place for Japanese street food, Yakitori Taisho is reliable and offers all kinds of dishes that you would not normally find in a Japanese restaurant. Go with an open mind, immerse yourself in the ambiance, and discover something new... a chicken skin skewer perhaps?! Try the calpico if you have never had one. Get it with alcohol and you will get nice and tipsy. Get a giant beer for not a lot. I'd recommend that you go with only 1 more person to avoid a long wait.

Yakitori is a tiny place located on the west end of St. Mark's. As a result, there is usually a bit of a wait to be seated. I sat at the bar style dining area. I gave my food and drink order, and shortly received my drink (a beer, I ordered it as a draft, got it in a bottle - not a big deal). Then I sat. and I sat. and I sat. and waited and waited. Eventually a waitress comes up to me and asks me if I'm done. I'm a bit perplexed, I explain to her I haven't received my food. Turns out they never placed my food order...they weren't even sure where it was. I pointed to the waitress who took my order but she seemed clueless. The order was placed and I waited a bit and finally received it. The food overall was good. I had a mixed place of chicken meatballs and some beef skewers served over rice with kimchi in it. The problem is that the place is run in a chaotic fashion, and there are waitresses working there who do not speak English, which for the most part works ok for them since the crowd is largely Japanese, but for someone like me, it obviously didn't. Hopefully they will do something about this.

I went here with a group of people last night for a friend's going-away dinner. We ordered a bunch of food to share - 2 orders of french fries (with salty roe-mayo dipping sauce), tuna-avocado salad, salmon rice ball, ramen, and of course some yakitori: the A set, which included 2 skewers each of chicken, chicken skin, chicken meatballs, gizzard, and pork, plus a couple of additional skewers, chicken liver and bacon-wrapped scallops. We also ordered some bottles of sake and plum wine. The tuna and avocado salad was amazing, containing cubes of raw tuna and sliced avocado over a bed of shredded cabbage or something, dressed with a creamy wasabi dressing. The rice ball with cooked salmon inside was HUGE and delicious, big enough for each of us to have a couple bites. The ramen was pretty good, but certainly not the best I've had. The fries were thick-cut and crispy and so hot I burned the roof of my mouth and had skin peeling from my hard palate all night. The accompanying roe dipping sauce was interesting and I liked it at first, but got sick of it after a while. I think I just prefer sweet dips for my fries, since everyone else at the table loved it. As far as the yakitori goes, the chicken skin was phenomenal - sweet, salty, and crispy. The bacon-wrapped scallops were also delicious. The bacon could have been a bit crispier but it was certainly abundant and the scallops were perfectly cooked. The liver and meatballs were quite good as well. We found the gizzards to be a bit bland, but the texture was good. The plum wine was excellent but pricey ($16 for a small bottle), and I drank far more than my fair share. The restaurant itself is narrow, crowded, and loud. You may need to wait a bit for a table and once you're seated (on a tiny, hard stool in most cases) you probably won't have a lot of elbow room. Still, the food and drink makes up for it and it's a fun vibe for a night out with friends if you can speak loud enough to carry a conversation. I'll definitely be back.

A friend took me here when I was on vacation in New York, and I decided to search it up on yelp! Yay! Thankfully, it was easy to find. I still hold onto a picture of the front of the restaurant in case I ever forget the name. The place is cramped, but I liked that it was. I love the whole dive bar, ?run down look. It made the place more casual and inviting aha. Also, the whole environment makes me feel like I'm really somewhere out there in Japan, instead of some fancy decor restaurant to get people to walk in. The yakitori here is my favorite, but that's only between Honda-ya and a few wannabes in the OC. ?And, I dream about the kimchi yaki udon from time to time.

I ran into this place by chance as my brother and I walked along St. Marks. We were looking for an outside-our-comfort-zone place to eat, and this fit the bill just fine. Its a small place, but that's part of the fun and the food is good. The bill wasn't ridiculous either. Waited about 5 minutes for spots at the bar, which was a little cramped. We tried the squid, the B set, and grilled yellow fin along with some rice wine and a couple of gigantic sodas. I was partial to the beef sticks and squid. The chicken balls and fin weren't my thing, but my brother loved them. Will definitely be back to try some of the other stuff on the substantial menu.

This place was a disappointment. I think the only reason it attracts so many people (besides being right on Saint Marks) is the novelty of an authentic-seeming izakaya. But being "authentic" doesn't make it good. It's like having a Denny's drive-through in the middle of Japan - sure you may want to go there if you're homesick, and sure it may be more "American" than most things there, but it's still crap American food. This is what this place is - mediocre Japanese food with a mediocre cheap izayaka diner atmosphere. For someone who has had any remotely good Japanese food, this place is a complete waste of time (not to mention over priced).

This place is amazing for that late night post-drinking appetite. One orders a lot of small dishes and shares them. Basically all are grilled and on sticks, yum and yum. I love how the Japanese cooks yell over the general loudness of the restaurant when the orders are up. I like the asparagus with roe mayo and yakitori: chicken meatball (these are addictive but I'm pretty sure there is straight-up chicken fat in them), chicken liver, chicken skin, shrimp, various grilled rice balls. Warning: I have gone here on sober evenings and it just wasn't as good.

I came here on a Sunday night after encountering a 1 and a half hour wait at another ramen place up the street (Ippudo). My friend and I were still craving ramen so we went down St. Marks to see what was there. Yakitori Taisho was the first place we walked by, and it was full and buzzing with folks. We walked in the door and encountered a line of people packed into the narrow and tiny entranceway to the seating areas. Pretty soon after we walked in, the hostess came up and took down our name and party size. I left the place for a minute to check out the other ramen-y places around. I came back after five minutes of scouring, finding no other place that looked as good and was as packed (a good sign, I feel). When I went in, I saw my friend was already seated. So quick! We were sat right at the counter, directly in front of all the action: the kitchen! We got to see them make all the food, the yakitori grill smoke filled the air with the delicious odor of grilled meat. I was tempted to get some grilled skewers, but decided to stick to my original plan of noodles. My friend and I both wanted spicy stuff, so I got the Spicy Udon Noodle Dish (no broth) and my friend got the Spicy Ramen (with broth). Both dishes were served in a few minutes, and were absolutely fantastic! My Udon Dish had a perfect balance of all components: the glossy gooey sauce was salty and a little spicy (though I could've like more) and covered each noodle completely, but not overly so. The pork pieces were pan-fried, so a little grilled-like in parts. And the kimchee - soft, sweet, and spicy pieces of cabbage! My friend's ramen soup was also amazing. The pork broth was really flavorful, and much spicier than my noodle dish (a little bummed mine was mild, but meh). We also got genmaicha (toasted brown rice green tea) which warmed us up and was super tasty. On top of the food, the atmosphere is great. The guys working the kitchen are young hip dudes, having a good time, but really efficient too. The waiters were really nice, too. They didn't make me feel guilty for stalling a bit before ordering (there was so much to choose from, and I am horrible with making decisions!). At the end of the meal, they boxed up our leftovers, and when the bill came, it was only $18 for the both of use. I don't think they charged for the tea, which seemed to be something you could definitely get dinged for in NY ($3 for a small hot ?Lipton tea?? really?). So we tipped well! Definitely a fun experience. Like another world. With ridiculously tasty eats.

Excellent snacks on a stick. Garlic on a stick is not as bad as it sounds, in fact it's one of my favorites. Scallions on a stick pretty good. The fries and mayonnaise dish makes Paula Dean look like a health nut, but it is quite a tasty treat.

One piece of advice- GET HERE EARLY. ?COme by 530 and you shuold be ok. ?This place gets overly packed during dinner time and it's mainly NYU students dominating this eatery. ?The food is simple- either pieces of meat on a stick or pieces of meat on a stick. ?They also have some appetizers like salmon ball and some simple soups and rice dishes too. ?But you're here to eat Yakitori so EAT IT! ?My husband can't help but order their chicken skin on a stick. ?Mmmm. ?Gross as it sounds, I really like the garlic on a stick too. ?You'd be surprise to see that justa ?few sticks will fill you up in no time. ?The interior is pretty cute. ?It's cozy and the tables are close together but I think the set-up is done so that way they can generate a higher traffic flow.

Flew in last night and decided to try some yakitori since all my friends that visit NY rave about this place. My initial reaction was that this place was very similar to what I would think japanese yakitori place might look like. Never been to Japan but I imagine this is what it would look like. We decided to sit at the bar since the wait for a table took some time. It was pretty cool to watch the "cooks" place the skewers on top of the grill and also juggle the task of making other foods on the menu... eg ramen and udon dishes. For those who are anal about cleanliness, I advise yoou not to sit at the bar... but if you sit at the bar... try not to look at them work back there because you might see some thing that might make you not wanna eat there again... but i think it's like that in every kitchen so I was able to get over it. The food was ok. The skewers are ok. The french fries with the spicy mayo dip that had masago in it was ok... just a little fishy. I also got the kimchee yakiudon... which was again... just ok. They used too much sesame oil and the kimchee was overly fermented. Overall, I enjoyed eating here because A. I've never had this kind of japanese food B. The place was 100% authentic Japanese C. I've never had kimchee yakiudon, french fries with masago spicy mayo dipping sauce, and a ball of fried white rice. Other than that and now that I've experienced this type of food, I don't know if I'd actually go back again. It was good... but it was honestly nothing spectacular. People who are giving 5 stars are just culturally shocked OR they were really drunk. If you're used to asian foods and have never been to a japanese yakitori place, I'd recommend going at least once. I think my review would be different if I went drunk last night. Maybe I'll have to do that. Oh yeah... maybe I'm a newbie but does this place not serve water? I asked for water 3 times and it never came. But my check did! Maybe they only have beer. idunno

This is a pretty good place with a very broad menu and that is what I like about it. ?The actual yakitori itself is mediocre, but that is compensated with other good things on the menu like their tuna sashimi salad. ?Come here, drink a lot of sake and eat broadly! ?You will be happy and saying lots of "KAMPAIs"

Another hidden gem from the transformed St. Mark's Street. The place is extremely packed for the space alloted and there is usually a line waiting for the available seats. However, the decent service along with the tasty food more than make up for its shortcomings. The fried crab and the yakitoris are delicious way to end the night.

Chicken liver was a little undercooked. ?A little mushy for my liking. Grilled Squid was good, but needed more flavor. I would stop back to throw back some beer, chicken gizzards, and the plate of steak with some good friends for some good times!

I love izakaya food - Japanese tapas. After trying a few things during a few visits, I have determined that there are a few staples that are required to be ordered each visit: rock shrimp and pork spare ribs. soo juicy and tender and sweet. yummmm I also like that its so cheap but you can order and explore so many different dishes! Alas, it doesn't get 5 stars b/c I honestly think Furaibo in LA is better. But for now, Taisho will satiate my cravings.

Our food came reasonably fast but sitting at the bar, we saw that the okonomiyaki turned out to be pre-made and merely reheated by microwave. We still prefer the made-to-order ones at Otafuku which has a less doughy texture and a more flavorful meat topping. Sapporo is available on tap and the staff is friendly.

This was my first experience with an izakaya style restaurant and I LOVED it. ?I went with my hubby and sat at the bar. ?It was a little crowded but it was okay... the food made up for it. ?We tried a few different things. ?The Octopus balls were okay. ?This was the first time I've had them so I don't have anything to compare them to so I'd like to try them again. ?But I am not sure if they make them fresh or just heat them up. ? Then we shared the Combo B and a few additional skewers. ?I loved, loved LOVED the chicken skin. ?It was the perfect amount of crispy, juicy, salty and sweet. ?I'm drooling now just thinking of them. ?I also like the chicken meatballs, the shisito peppers and the beef tongue. ?I thought the chicken and beef skewers were overcooked for my taste (but I tend towards the rarer end of the spectrum). ?Reading some of the other reviews I wish I tried the garlic skewers too. ? I can't wait to come back.

My first time trying Yakitori (and Taisho, obviously) was everything I hoped it would be. Great food, great beer and I liked the rush of it all. We sat at the bar on a Saturday night, which was okay with us to not have to wait any longer. Everything was tasty, especially the scallions and the chicken skewers. We also ordered teriyaki chicken, which they forgot to bring, but they gave us a 10% discount after the fact, completely unexpected. We didn't wait that long or really complain, so I chalk that up to good customer service. I hope to be back next time I'm in New York!

everything dealing with this place is phenomenal. the food, the smell, the lay out. i don't even mind the wait (sometimes you have to wait 30 minutes to sit) but its OK because they take your number own and cal you when its ready. service is always friendly and prices are legit. all in all a great place to try new foods (from coy tongue to skate wing) or if u want to grab a drink.Yakitori means Japanese BBQ. something i learned after a year of going to this place.

As someone who has visited japan several times. I really felt it captured the atmosphere of small yakitori/izakaya places in Tokyo. By small I mean even shoulder to other customers when sitting on the stool area. If you are used to this then you should not have a problem with the size. After all having the yakitori cooked right in front of you is a great experience. There are tables in the back if you prefer more space. There was no line when I got in there but I have seen big lines after 8pm. Go early to avoid these lines. We had the b set yakitori and it basically comes with about 6-7 types of yakitori. 2 each I believe. It was great with some beer and just to sample the yakitori right off the grill. And who knows maybe if you have enough beer you can go karaoke across the street. There are 2. You will have enough money since the yakitori is cheap!!

I love Yakitori Taisho, I always make my friends come here, and we always order the Salmon Cream Yakisoba personal favorite of mine and friends on the Menu. ? ? The service at times can be better in my opinion. Although it is a very small place, and gets cramped up like every time. I'd say the biggest party they can accommodate is 6 or so, I wouldn't ?want to go in with a party bigger than that. I also find they're Tempura Ice cream actually one of the best around, compared to other places because they use to much cake layering. ? Just your typical Izakaya, if you want to have a nice tall glass of beer and some Yakitori, this is the place for you.. which they are open very late

If anybody craves great authentic japanese dishes, I recommend coming here. ?They have a huge variety of dishes and the prices are reasonable. ?They also have a decent beer/sake list. ?This place is so popular that it is always packed. ?The food arrives very quickly and is always hot! ?Only downside is that it is small so they pack the tables and chairs so close together that you are almost touching another person and it is hard to maneuver around your table. ?They have two locations on the same street so if one is too packed, I just go to the second location. =) ?Now I feel like eating japanese...haha

I was pleasantly surprised by Yakitori Taisho. I did not really know what to expect and wasn't sure it would be my kind of place considering that I am not a big meat eater. But dinner was great! My boyfriend and I ordered a ridiculous amount of skewers, including: chicken meat, chicken balls, bacon/asparagus, bacon/scallops, scallions, shiitake mushroom, garlic, and probably others that I can't remember now, together with edamame, a fried rice ball (yummy), sauteed vegetables and the fried chicken. That was a little more than needed for the two of us, and we ended up taking the fried chicken home, but everything was very tasty. The whole grilled squid looked fantastic, and I'll have to go back to give it a try. Last but not least: Japanese beer on tap... perfect with a meal like this one. The venue is pretty small and get really crowded, but it's got a cozy feel and it made for a fun dinner. I'll definitely go back.

This funky yakitori spot is great if you want to get some tasty skewered meats for a reasonable price. ?As you walk down the steps from street level you see the long stretching grill set up and small tables run the length of the space. ?Immediately you are greeted by a swarm of harmonic wait-staff and welcomed to your table. ?The menu has great selections including the bacon wrapped scallop- one of my favs especially if you're a sucker for the combination of sweet scallop and smokey bacon flavors, the chicken balls are famous, the fried oysters are crispy on the outside and plump inside, other must tries are the pork spare ribs, i wouldn't waste time with the ramen- manhattan has dozens of ramen specialty spots. ?The pork belly, beef, chicken livers, grilled squid, shrimp yakitori are all succulent and delicious. ?The service is pretty basic with all the calling out ?by the grill masters and wait staff which only adds more character to this special place...

taisho straight up deserves the 5 stars. the food is great and its cheap cheap! i love the grill and the cozyness of the place and most of the grilled stuff is very good. dont be afraid to try the non grill stuff like the kimchi udon noodles which was also really good. im a big fan of the combo B which comes with 10 skewers. oh and the scallops wrapped in bacon is always great. very reasonably priced and you can order a la carte if you arent too hungry and just snacking with the skewers averaging 1.50-2.50. only downside is that its really small and they want to kick you out the minute you finish.

I love St. Marks place. You have many bars as well as cuisine. On that one little strip, you can find many japanese restaurants. We decided to head to Yakitori because it was always filled with people as we walked by. You get the feeling that your in Japan due to the seating and people around you. We were one of two groups there at the time that weren't Japanese. We ordered some mixed skewers, rice balls, french fries, cheese fries, chicken teriyaki, and bbq beef. I know this is'nt the traditional food of Japan but it was good. The food was fresh and juicy. The cheese fries was very cheesy. The rice ball was salty but good. I can't really complain. This is my type of Japanese food since I am allergic to seafood. We also had a pitcher of Sapporo which is good. The food was good and cheap. The only thing I did'nt like was that the waiter ran after us two different times because of the tip we left. He asked in a bad accent, " You dont like our food? Was there a problem?" My roomate paid for the dinner and left a nice tip on his card. I left 10 bucks and he thought that was all we had left. We were forced to give up another 5 bucks. I checked on my Iphone to see if that 10 dollar tip was good considering the total amount of the dinner is said yes plus what my roomate left. Overall good food, good location and good atmosphere just dont catch yellow fever.

we have been trying to go to this place for the longest time, but most of the time it was packed and the wait was long. we were lucky the other night, we went there and we were sit right away. we ordered the mother of bbq, grilled fish, rock shrimp, grilled sushi, fried noodle, oden, more grilled fish, more everything. i dont eat pork/beef but i could still manage to stuff myself. the food was so japanese. and atmosphere was so japanese. you need to go if you are sick of regular jap sushi/noodle.

besides the reputation and location, it is not that great. the food is sloppily made, it is obviously very crowded and IMO, not worth it at all. although once i did have a yummy green apple vodka drink there taht was the size of my head. but i'm sure that is easy to recreate yourself. nothing special at all. pretty dirty and grimey, actually.

Had dinner with a friend and the manfriend on a Friday evening at Yakitori Taisho (my pick) in the East Village. I had really wanted to try some of the less conventional dishes at this place but my dining companions were not super into it. We split the cucumbers with miso paste, the seaweed salad (very refreshing on the damp and muggy evening), and the following skewers: a few chicken skin, 3 chicken chunk, 2 shishito pepper, 1 bacon wrapped asparagus, 2 bacon wrapped scallop that were rare and chewy on the inside with a strange orange exterior (we weren't sure what these were, but I can't find anything else on the menu it could have been), not so good, 3 of the shrimp, and I was supposed to get 1 smelt, but it never showed up. Dealing with the hoards of kids with umbrellas on the teeming sidewalks, the wait, and a few other issues started our meal off on the wrong foot for my companions, but in the end I think we all agreed that it was pretty fun and interesting, plus a good value. With 1 large asahi, a small cold sake, and a few sodas, our total was about $54 pre-tip.

We were walking around in East Village and everyone was started to get hungry and everyone was yelping to see which is a good places to try. We try and stop by soba ya but it was pack so we saw all of the review on Yakitori Tasiho and decided this would be the perfect place but it is alway fun to eat Japanese small dishes and exotic piece of meat. I enjoy walking thru east village because there were soooo many restaurant to try and at first i wanted Ipuddo but of course it was closed today(twice I try and go here and twice it has been close). The wait at this place was suppose to be 30min so we waited but it lasted more then 1 hr wait for this place and of course I didn't mind waiting because if that many people is willing to wait, it mean this place is delicious. After we got sat down and we order a few different things from the menu(rock shrimp, eel roll, tempura squid and one of the set dinner w.different bbq item such as shrimp, mushroom, smelt fish, ect and I order a few things that I enjoy eating such as chicken liver and chicken skin on a skewer. Dish after dish came and everything was very disappointing. The fried squid was greasy, the rock shrimp just suck, the bbq seafood and veggie was bland and all that I tasted afterward was charcoal in my mouth. I wanted a beer to drink but i wasn't allow to(long story). The decent thing that I enjoy the most has ?to be the chicken liver and skin but it wasn't all that but alot better then anything else I order. The place was pack and it was just fun being there but the food just suck and bland. I try and like it but not sure why alot of yelper good this place a great review for, personally I think because it is different so they rate this higher but if you ever tasted yakitori then this isn;t the place for you.

Mmmmm tiny little meat bites on sticks! I came here on a double date with some friends. Since it was the first time here for me I let the other couple that we came with do all the ordering. I can't really say for sure what was ordered but I know that I ate chicken heart (it wasn't really for me) and chicken skin (effin delicious!!!). We also got the chicken meatballs which were surprisingly good with hot sauce. In addition to the yakitori, we also got an order of udon. It was the first time I've ever liked udon!!! Unfortunately for me I was sick at the time and was unable to wash down all this wonderful bar food with a nice cold Sapporo. There were really only two problems that I could think of, hence the loss of a star. First off, this place is tiny. That might be fine for all the city folks who are used to cramped restaurants in the village but I'm from Long Island and I like my elbow room. The second problem, I was hungry an hour later. I ended up getting a five piece at Wendy's on the way home.

Delicious. ..never had this kind of food before so I was happy that we were able to come here while we were in NY for a couple of days. ?It's kind of cool how they had all the meats on skewers (kinda like the American bbq style way where you put meats and veggies on a skewer). . .but this meat is very different. ..not only did they have the traditional meats such as chicken and shrimp, but they had all this other crazy stuff! ?Too bad I couldn't really enjoy the food because I got sick so I had to order the kimchee stew. . .but I did get a few bites of the various skewers and they were very flavorful! ?This place is really cramped because there's not much space to sit, but it's a cute little place. ?I don't think we have very many of these places in the bay area (and if there are, please let me know!) but I'd definitely come here again if I went back to NY so I could really enjoy my skewers without being sick!

ok so i've been here twice only but i'm gonna keep coming back. ?And sorry if my grammar is bad or it seems like im slurring but i just got back from Yakitori Taisho and had 3 tall bottles of Sake! ?First off...i think Yakotori Taisho (yakitori boss) is "off the hook". ?It's a REAL hole in the wall. ?It's a place I've passed many many times until my friends told me about this place. ?The food is ?pretty average. ?It's like your street vendor food type from Japan. ?You walk in to a charming bar style seating with more regular seating in the back. ?I love sitting at the bar and watching them call orders out to each other. ?"Ichi tonkatsu ramen onegaishimasu!!" ?(One tonkatsu ramen please!") ?Yea, I'm studying Japanese. ?But even though food is average, it's the atmosphere that's going to keep me coming back here. ?Not your 5 star restaurant and not your rat infested takeout but right smack in the middle! ?I can't explain it but even though my japanese isn't fluent, i feel right at home here. ?Prices are amazingly good for the village. ?My buddy and I had ramen, about 8 skewers of yakitori (including chicken heart..yum yum), and 5 tall bottles of hot sake totaling to about $50? ?YES please!!! ?Again, please pardon my ramble....i'm currently drunk but I just HAD to review this!

This place really caters to a young college crowd on a budget, so you can't really expect a four-star joint. ?It's a tiny, rustic, cramped restaurant that's loud and boisterous, but that's the whole charm of the place. ?That being said, the food was very good for the price. ?I went with three other friends, and they all got their food pretty quickly. ?I was the only one who ordered a salad, but my food didn't come out until after waving down the waiter at least three times asking where my order was. ?By the time it came out, my friends were almost done with their dishes. ?Maybe it was because of the large crowd there that night. ?For that reason, i give this place 3 stars. ?Had the service been better and more attentive, i would definitely give it 4 stars. ?I ordered the tuna and avocado salad on a bed of seasoned greens and onions. ?Sounds so simple, but it was really very good. ?I also order the chicken yakitori...also very good. ?It was seasoned well and not at all dry. ? I also had their frozen peach drink. ?I could hardly taste the alcohol, but by the time i was done with it I had a nice buzz. ?I especially like it because it wasn't drenched in sweet syrup. ?It was a nice refreshing drink.

Food is great, an easy 4stars for that however I have never received worst service in a restaurant before. Be weary of coming here on a weekend night. I was here on a saturday night around 10. So first it took us 25 minutes to be seated. After we got seated we weren't even given water or anything. A couple next to us went through the same problems. They were able to order after waiting about 30mins. We had to wait around 45 mins just to order after hounding down a server that is. Then 20 mins past, still no water or beers. Had to hound another server down and ask for the drinks and even then the beer comes after the food. After all of my friends got their food, I had yet to even get my appetizer which came around an hour after everything which at this point everyone else had finished eating. So in all good food, but horrrrrrible experience... Plenty of other Japanese places around besides this.

you cannot be in the east village and never step into taisho! it is THE place to go to for meat (& vegetable) on a stick there is a lot to choose from - it's japanese nibbles from your classic squid salad (but skip the okonomiyaki) to ramen. but you come here for the yakitori - at the end of the night i'm always a little surprised that i can eat $50 worth of things on sticks tips: make sure your entire party is at the restaurant or they will not seat you! and the small japanese lady with the big hair kind of scares me so don't piss her off

Decided to stop by this place after attending the winter jazzfest. Craving for some warm food in the bitter cold. This is a small, long and narrow restaurant. We just sat in front since there were open seats. Ordered the bbq sampler and noodles. If this is is what you called an authentic japanese yakitori, then i'm not a big fan of it. Some of the meat is tough and have an aftertaste. The bbq just doesn't have much taste to it, a little bland for our taste palette. The sauce complements the meat but I'm not sure what to do with the mountain of raw vege underneath the bbq presentation. The noodles tasted fishy ( I forgot what it's called but it did look delicous with creamy white sauce). ?I can see why this place is popular because it opens late and the check wouldn't burn a hole in your pocket. Other than that, if you're into (authentic?) yakitori and noodles, doesn't mind small tight space, doesn't mind the waiting, then i guess this is it. For us, we had to stop by the halal cart after leaving this place as we weren't satisfied with our food. Good luck to the first timers!

I found this place thanks to Yelp when I decided it would not be fun to wait two hours for Ramen at Ippudo. Yakitori Taisho isn't really a Ramen place but we had Ramen on the brain so ordered it none the less. It isn't the best Ramen I've ever had but it still hit the spot and the couple of skewers we ordered on the side were indeed heavenly! I'm sure it isn't massively authentic or whatever but the bacon wrapped asparagus was fan-tastic! All in all, a delicious and cheap way to relive the old student days I never had in Japan..

there is much better yakitori in the city but what makes this place a 5 star-er is their steak fries wit cod roe/mayo dip. ?this strange combo of potatoe, grease, fish and mayo will haunt you for weeks after eating.. you'll crave it. ?and you'll return. ? whoever thought to mix steak fries and that dip together was a culinary genious person with super tasting skills. ? i also like their octopus/wasabi appetizer..

3.5 stars. I've been here twice, and the first time I ordered noodle soup which was a big mistake and some random skewers which were unimpressive. Recently I was here and ordered better items - garlic grilled squid (delicious), the steak plate (kinda grisly) and the black sesame karaage (fried chicken). This was pretty tasty and I ordered the large ginger ale, which was soda in a huge beer mug - the size of my forearm! So the food was much better the second time, but they really pack you in there - there were 4 of us at a table that would have been tight for two considering that they had three people squeezed at the next table which really should have been a 1 top.

a great place to go for a chill night with 2-3 friends. inside isn't spacious at all so you may not want to go with a party of 5 or more. expect at least 20 minutes to get your table but the food makes the wait worthwhile. personally wouldn't recommend ordering soup or any dishes that aren't really "japanese" but anything on wooden sticks they have are delicious. sake and/or asahi to cap the night.

A review of this place is long past due. I am almost too full to do it justice. This place is just amazing. Narrow entry with cozy modern sushi bar style seating with a full view of the yaketori making, followed by an open dining area with tables and just a bit more space between your neighbors. the waiters are lively and extremely polite with high service standards for some place relatively caus on st. marks. the chefs are lively and fun to watch (which why i recommend the bar). The menu is diverse, from skewers to ramen to fun apps like fries (not greasy at all) with cod roe dipping sauce. It's just so good. Tiny plates, big meal. Delish kimcheee. Perfect with pitchers or beer or a nice sake. The coziest place you will find in the winter and a chill place to eat in the summer (there is a small outdoor seating area). I want to add the atmosphere isn't just fun--the food is made with quality and care. OISHI-DES!

idk why this place has such good reviews... my friend and I we tried the skewers which were disgusting and they gave us even the chicken almost raw! also we ordered the chicken skin since a lot of people mentioned how good it is... it was so nasty... literally you just chew on pure fat... i had to just spit it out...we ordered a bunch of other dishes... the salmon... beef... octopus ball... food is cheap in here... but taste wise so bad... we thought they just had a bad night.. so we went again couple weeks later... and we ordered their bento that comes with skewers and rice and meat and ?a noodle dish... food was so disgusting... i had spit my food out... I'm never going back there again. The dollar pizza across street is better worth it than here.

I wouldn't go back. The idea is nice, but the Yakitori was oily and not that tasty. The meatballs were the best but the scallions for example are totally over priced for a piece of green on a stick. There are better things to eat Japanese. Also - I suspect one of their workers stole my wallet. Yes - I know - nice one!!!!

I guess this applies to both here and Oh Taisho! ?I really love coming to this place. ?I usually stick to the skewers and the mentai potato; ?I don't see a point in getting the okonomiyaki nor the takoyaki since Otafuku is on the next block. ?The karaage is really good as well. ?The only problem I have with this place is how crowded it can get but I usually try and get there when it opens to avoid the wait. ?Good place to start off the night with some food and a few pitchers.

worst yakitori EVER. i was excited to try this place out after reading all the reviews. restaurant seated us right away which was surprising. ordered yakitori from quail egg to chicken thighs to scallions. everything was greasy and bland. made the killer mistake of ordering more - quail and tofu salad. the tofu is the reason why people hate tofu and it pains me to describe it. i already began drinking due to my disappointment and even that didnt help matters! really really dont understand the hype with this place .
